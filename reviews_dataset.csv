0,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","5 stars🐉Ughhh! I went through so many emotions while reading this book: happiness, sadness, fury, excitement, giddiness, and full-on panicking during the Parapet scene!This book was a rollercoaster of twists and had me so hooked from the start! Not once did it feel boring or like I should just skim something, and for once, I know the hype was so worth it! 😩• Spoilers ahead — and I seriously want y'all to enjoy this book without spoilers haha.This book is the perfect blend of Fantasy-Romance because it had the spiciest romance scenes with lots of sexual tension and enough twists that will keep you awake the whole night.*Dark circles forming, but anything for XadenVi.*❝The weak don’t survive here, especially not in the Riders Quadrant. The dragons make sure of that.❞In the beginning, Karen aka General Sorrengail, forces Violet to join Rider's Quadrant, a place where people become riders and form bonds with dragons.This is in contrast to Violet's original plan of following her father's path and becoming a scribe, responsible for documenting history. This makes her feeling angry and fearful because the decision is up to her mother, and she has no choice but to agree. She wasn't mentally or physically prepared for this challenge and have to do anything to survive!╰┈➤ VIOLET SORRENGAIL AKA VIOLENCE:❝You look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?❞Despite dealing with a chronic illness and having weak joints, she was incredibly awesome and strong! Her personality was so relatable that I felt connected right away.Her anxieties and fears during challenges in the rider's quadrant, and how she conquered them with her smarts, were truly inspiring. She showed that knowledge is real power! Her rollercoaster of emotions—fear, anger, desire, happiness—kept me amazed.Even when teased and called weak, she never let anyone walk all over her. And fr, I didn't even get that 'oh I'm so tiny and frail' or the 'pick me vibes' as mentioned somewhere because she actually had a illness!I would've dashed for the hills (or the scribe quadrant in Violet's situation) when every single cadet was dead set on killing me!It was like half luck, and 25% thanks to the dragon scale corset, and another 25% to Violet's intelligence that kept her alive!And - wait XADEN PROTECTED HER WELL TOO! 🤭❝What I lack in strength, I make up for in speed.❞— She kept training and had a lot of improvement and her skills with the daggers were impeccable! landing straight on the target.╰┈➤ XADEN RIORSON:❝Stay the hell away from Xaden Riorson.❞Fantasy men are just FINE AF! From the beginning, he exudes a mysterious aura. Despite the stern lines on his face and a SCAR ON HIS LEFT BROW 🥵, he exudes both danger and allure.His character captivates me so deeply that even if I hadn't known he was the mmc, I would have rooted for him.fuck Dain.Xaden comes across as grumpy and ruthless, concealing his emotions behind a stoic facade.However, his interactions with Violet reveal a thoughtful, kind, and trusting side that filled me with so many emotions. It's this side of him that I adore. 💞He holds the position of the wing leader of FOURTH WING with great authority. His intelligence and power are remarkable, and don't even get me started on the way he walks, talks, and smirks – it leaves me utterly on my knees for him!🧎‍♀️His character possesses incredible depth, and I would've loved to have his POV.He's a shadow wielder, and just by imagining the shadows around him, his rebellion relic, and his scar — I feel something inside of me! 😮‍💨REBECCA ADDED EVERY QUALITY TO MAKE HIM THE HOTTEST CHARACTER! 🤭— Ruthless who? He's such a softie....🔪 gave Violet training for sparring matches.🔪 made a saddle for her to be seated on her dragon.🔪 made a custom dagger for her.🔪 killed a room full of cadets who tried to kill Violet, just by using his shadows.🔪 took care of her when she was hurt.🔪 punished a wing leader who tried to kill Violet.╰┈➤ DRAGONS:—So the most sarcasticpersoncreature award goes to TAIRN!🫡God, how much I loved this grumpy broody dragon! He was one of the deadliest and strongest dragons, and he was bonded with none other than Violet! 🤭 His remarks were so sarcastic and savage, and the way he always scoffed and knew about her feelings for Xaden. Hehehe, and he also adores Sgaeyl sm!If he were actually a human, he'd be so grumpy and possessive, I'M TELLING YA'LL! 😂💕❝And to think, I’d almost forgotten just how loquacious humans are.❞Andarna:This cutie goldie dragon—OMF, she was such a cutie! I loved how optimistic and innocent she actually was and possessed great powers, but she was only 2 years old! And the fact that she's also bonded with Violet 🥺Sgaeyl:We didn't get much about her, though hopefully in the next book, but I'm so glad she and Tairn are bonded mates! GOD SHE HAS A BRILLIANT TASTE IN MEN. 🥵— ENEMIES TO LOVERS WHERE HE WANTS TO KILL HER? *Sign me up*❝He’s a third-year, and he will kill you the second he finds out who you are.❞Xaden is the son of Fen Riorson, known as THE GREATEST TRAITOR due to his leadership in a rebellion group. Sadly, this resulted in the execution of all rebel group members in front of their children, who were then marked with a relic symbolizing the rebellion.These children were forcibly placed into the Rider's Quadrant, where they faced the challenge of survival. The overseeing figure during these executions was none other than General Sorrengail (Violet's mother),so they're enemies, and he's the one who's gonnakillhandle her.🤭The enemies-to-lovers approach in this book was really well done.It felt very realistic and stayed true to the idea that 'children shouldn't be punished for their parents' mistakes.' The kids marked by the relic understood this, and Violet did too. What I especially liked was how Xaden and Violet's relationship grew naturally without being burdened by guilt from their pasts.Even though they weren't enemies for very long, the book didn't rush their journey to becoming lovers. Instead, it skillfully portrayed the gradual development of trust, as well as their decision to let go of their desires, leading them to eventually fall in love. ♥️Violet was super confused by Xaden's behavior. Rather than harming her, he encouraged her and saw her potential. He treated her as strong, not fragile, which both confused and intrigued her. 😉❝Going for blood today, are we, Violence?❞After Threshing (where the cadets were bonded with dragons), Violet discovered that Tairn, her dragon, was actually the bonded mate of Sgaeyl, Xaden's dragon. This connection tied the four of them together, and if one of them died, they all would. This meant Xaden couldn't consider killing her anymore, (not that he had intended to in the first place.) 🥹THE SEXUAL TENSION WAS TENSIONING.🥵 The sexual tension between them was incredibly strong! The heated lust-filled stares, locking eyes, proximity on mats, and more, yet neither wanted to act on it. Their first kiss was incredibly passionate and I was so giddy at that time. There were 3 graphic scenes but Damn they were HOT AF! 🫣🔥❝I am annoyingly aware of everything you do.❞NOT THEM SHATTERING WINDOWS, BREAKING ARMOIRES AND CHAIRS, BURNING CURTAINS AND FORESTS WHILE DOING ✨IT✨.╰┈➤ SIDE CHARACTERS:Rhiannon and Rodic:They were literal babies and I loved how both of them supported Violet! Idk when and how Rodic made his place in my heart but he was so cute. Always adopting humor for every situation and was so calm hehe! 🥺 Am I the only one who wants them together?Like who Tara, Sawyer, or whatever his name is, just give Rhi and Rodic.Sawyer, Imogen, Bodhi, Garrick, Emery, Heaton:I loved how they all became a squad and clearly I would love more of them!Mira Sorrengail:This badass cutie, sexy hot, I love her! 🥵 She's so fierce and the best sister ever! 💞Liam Mairi:WE WERE ROBBED OF HIM. I WILL NEVER EVER FORGET HIM, please he was so precious. 🥺😭 I literally cried so much when he died! I already had a feeling that he might die, but god it was so painful. I was so badly hurt when he died. It was so painful to see him dying and then Xaden calling him Brother. My heart broke! I'm never forgetting that piece of shit Dain.Dain Aetos:This bitch, this traitor, this asshole, what the fuck! Why did he have to go and pull a full traitor-Adam-Kent behavior like bitch fuck off??I actually reasoned with him in the start and ignored him because he was just there to discourage Violet and gaslight her again and again by using 'best friend' but he so skillfully and fucked-uply betrayed her.IF HE DIDN'T READ VIOLET'S MEMORIES (by touching her face) and then not telling his father, LIAM WOULD BE FUCKING ALIVE. FUCK OFF, DAINNN. I WISH YOU GET SCORCHED BY TAIRN! 🤢❝Stop. Fucking. Coddling. Her.❞— yeah, bitch, get that!Jack Barlowe:He was a piece of shit just like Dain and I'm glad he was Violet's first kill, haha served him right! I don't want to give him more importance; he was shit AF! His death was so satisfying 😗🤝🏻Long-haired Luca and Traitor Tynan getting scorched was the best thing.General Sorrengail:I dislike her already and I know I'll loathe her in the next books, but the only good thing was she trusted that Violet is capable of becoming a rider.Syrena (Flier):She's a gryphon rider and had only 2 scenes, but I wish we get to see her in the next books!— some other things:1. I literally choked on my laugh when I read about how smartly Violet won all the sparring matches because she poisoned every player with different types of herbs during the match, and her choosing the breakfast duties to add the poisons in their lunch was such a badass move!It's truly proven by Violet that knowledge is power.2. When Dylan died, my heart just stopped for a moment, and I was so horrified when Aurelie died! (Guess I'm just going to grieve for Liam baby now.)3.All the challenges gave me Squid Game vibes, like all those tasks just to survive and so many deaths each day!Ugh, It was so fun yet horrifying to read. 🤧4.""Fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.”— these beautiful words!!?? 🤭5. I seriously don't even understand how Violet blocked the pain out and got so many stitches every month! I'd already be on my deathbed 😂6. Am I the only one who couldn't — even after reading 3 times — imagine the GAUNTLET scene???? like WTH WAS THAT 😭7.MY TOXIC TRAIT IS THAT I THINK I WOULD'VE KILLED THE VENIN IF I WERE IN VIOLET'S PLACE (wth? 💀💀)8. I had doubts about Venins and Wyvern from the start, and gosh, they were horrifying AF!If we want anything to be real, IT'S FICTIONAL MEN, not these ew!9. GOD, THE END? I'm still shocked 🥲whjwhsha, I love this book! Ayyayayayaya 🥺 TO MY READING SLUMP.... here I come!!!RATINGS:• Fourth Wing — 5 stars• Iron Flame– 3.75 stars*****I'm leaving this review here just so that someone will like it and remind me that I still need to read it after my exams.☹️🥲",5
1,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","The sad reality is this book will probably be GR best fantasy of 2023 though it has NOTHING of the fantasy elementsIf I wanted to read cheap immitation of every other fantasy book then this book it is 😡😡😡😡every time I have an atom of hope that there is something 0.0000001% original, someone casually points out that it's not!IMPORTANT NOTE FOR READERS AT THE ENDIs this the future of books? writers shamelessly taking others' work without even bringing their own to the table and the unknowing masses cheering them on!by now, this has become a game of ""SPOT THE COMMON, AND FIND THE DIFFERENCE""this book does not deserve an ounce of respect and this came after confirming that even the main characters' descriptions are literally takenPLEASE STOP SAYING THAT NOTHING IS ORIGINAL ANYMORE! YEAH? PROVE ITAND EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE, IF A WRITER FAILS TO BRING AT LEAST 20% ORGININALITY ONTO THEIR BOOK, DO THEY DESERVE TO BE CALLED WRITERS???It is one thing to sample an idea or concept from ""a book"", it is another to take the whole storyline and plot from ""a book"" or in this case ""books"" and make it your own.This book is a memory quiltMade from old stuff to look newIt takes everything that we know as familiar, comfort and nostalgic and weave it together to present it as something new giving you a FAKE sense of enjoymentLet's imagine that I am a new reader or someone who never reads fantasy or someone who hasn'tread and loved the other books mentioned down 👇🏻 I would have absolutely adored this book and considered it one of the best Adult fantasy this year because I knew nothing of them.And surprise surprise! This is what is happeningbut ignorance is not an excuse!Just because you haven't read it does not mean it is OK for this book to copy everything!starting this book, I liked that the characters were older than 18. As much as I enjoy YA, sometimes the age just throws me off! However, they still acted like a bunch of 16 and 17 yr.the lingo itself was so cringeimage:I read many YA characters more mature than the main characters in this bookread Ageless and Warda's one 1 star review of this book to understand where these characters went wrongThis book attempted to give us a badass female lead that understands that she is flawed, and recognizes her physical incompetence, but does not give a shit. She knows her worth and trusts her intelligence to be her biggest asset so she uses it to get what she wants. She is unapologetic. She knows that if she can’t be cunning, it's her life on the line. “I’ll never get over how quickly people move on around here, how callously death is swept under a rug and trampled on minutes later”but, personally, this failed. Because Violet was the typical ""I am weak in the body but somehow I can wip all your asses and accomplish anything"". She is supposed to have a sort of chronic pain that renders her in the disabled category. This is not said out loud in the book. You have to guess it yourself if you are not familiar with the symptoms or learn it from social media. So, it was a role-eye for me seeing her winning every challenge by cheating (which I accepted at first because she was disadvantaged) but then we get no information on how she trained and made herself stronger!. so what was the point of giving her a disability if we cannot see how she overcame it? Also, It was annoying at times seeing Violet practically throwing herself at Xaden like “Pick me, choose me, love me, fuck me”. Girl! Have some dignity. But who can blame her, X is hot and has""Shadow hands, iykyk.... looking at you ACOTAR and ToG fans""and let’s not forget the dragons! I mean who doesn’t love dragons? Throw in dragons with personalities who can hold a conversation and you get yourself a winnerBut these bastards decided with their ever Holly wisdom that a person with a mental disorder (look up Aboulomania) or with a bit of a bitchy attitude is weak and should be scorched to deathI am not going to touch on the characters more than that. Others have explained in detailed reviews the problems with the main leads.And the world building? Excuse me! What world building! If you can answer one question that's been nagging me (from the book, not theories) then I'll shut up about itA dragon without its rider is a tragedy. A rider without their dragon is dead.Why? Why is it this way?However, there is abig issuethat is nagging at me and making feel like I am sitting on the most comfortable sofa in the world but someone has put a cushion full of needles at my back. Every time I get a little bit relaxed, a needle pricks my spine or neck or back arm.THIS BOOK HAS NOTHING ORIGINAL AND I DARE ANYONE TO PROVE OTHERWISEWhat this book did is take several old famous ideas from other books and movies, weave it together, and the author simply tailored them with spray edges and a catching cover for bait to come up with a supposedly new book that would please young readers mostly. to quote my friend: ""This book scratches an itchand boy! did this strategy work!This did not sit well with me because :One: the author did not just take from one or two books, she took from several.Two: these ideas were not just inspiration or sampling, in many parts were almost literalThree: copying and sampling are OK as long as the book brings it's own added plot or storyline which in this case, Fourth Wing did notWhen I was annotating this book, I marked each time I found an almost literal resemblance to other books. (yellow marks the number)So lets begin (and I am keeping the best or worst to last)Let me begin with the main characters descriptionNo, this is not Violet Sorringale. This is Mare Barrow from Red Queen series. Brown and silver hair and lightning powerAnd the whole ""assumed dead brother who is resurrected and turns out he joined the rebellion""YeahIt's like FW has this weird fixation on this seriesbut Violet braids her hair you say! you know who else has silver braided hair and dragons?and how about this one?no this is not Xaden Riorsonthis is either the tall dark and all powerful Rhysand and his Shadow power (and Rhys sacrificed himself for his people, Xaden did as well)or the tall dark and handsome Dorian and his shadow handsBut Xaden has a scar on his face, near his eye more precisely! You know who else tall dark and handsome with an eye scar and rhymes with Xaden!Meadows baby! Our last name is MeadowsNo!? OK, here's another tall dark and handsome with scars and is always surrounded by showdows and his name starts with Az and ends with ""are you for real?!""Now, here's a trivia for youLet's count the number of books where if the guy has Shadow powers the girl gets a control over lighteningJust off the top of my headRed QueenShadow and BonesThe Shadow of Lightening .. etc.Now the plotline1-	Harry Potter: not talking about magic systems and dragons because many books have those, but “the cadets are thrown into “four wings” upon their arrival, they have to study and compete by gaining “points” and showing skills both physically and mentally.. The literal taking was from p 313 when there is a“tournament”where they had to“retrieve a stolen treasure”to“earn 60 points”2-	Divergent: I knew that this book was marketed as a combination of Divergent meets Game of Thrones I think, but it took the inspiration too far. I don’t want to read a cheap imitation of Divergent which this book had. The cadets are distributed into quadrants (factions). Violet ends up in the Riders (Dauntless) quadrant where if you show any sign of weakness you are either killed by a fellow cadet or scorched by a dragon!And the Tris/Four moment between Violet and Xaden is also hard to miss. She has a parent/sibling issue, he has a daddy issue. She fantasizes about him all the time (which is nauseating and untasteful at times). Him beating her ass and showing her that he hates her and maybe wants to kill her then ending up saving her life and training her. Even the knife-throwing scene was taken. And it goes on and on3-	The Hunger Games: this whole book was the Hunger Games – Dragon Edition. The cadets are literally allowed to kill each other even under the watchful eyes of their superiors. But that is not surprising when the professors so simply snap a cadet’s neck infront of others. I guess “the odds are always stacked against them” yep! This was in the book!And since they are at war and need soldiers, what better way to show how desperate they are than killing off their cadets, instead of sending them off to the other houses 🙄🙄4-	Shatter me/ACOTAR: What are these two series famous for? You guessed it. The predictable love triangle where the first love interest turns out to be a douche and the heroine ends up falling for the dark morally grey character. This is really starting to sound repetitive and obvious.5-	Throne of Glass (Empire of Storms): Dorian Havilliard has Phantom hands and Xaden has Shadow hands! Both can lift and hold anything with these “hands” and use them during intimate moments. In the beach scene, Aelin and Rowan’s passion fuses their power together and lose control. Same with Vi and X6-	Mulan: (yep! The animation) Mulan shows her strength and proves herself to her camp by using her wit to climb the pole using the weights instead of carrying them to retrieve the arrow and later they use their belts to climb the columns of the palace. The same move Violet uses by planting the rope around the shaft to climb it.7-	How to train your dragon: from the description of the dragons, to the lowering of the eyes when meeting one, to the Hiccup and Toothless moment, and the big scarry dragon and the small golden cute one, you cant help noticing these similarities when reading this bookBUT HERE ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS COPY CAT ISSUES8- The plot conflict of the book is the same as Game of ThronesSo instead of the seven kingdoms, Navarre is divided into six but with the province in the east makes it seven! To protect itself, Navarre has built a WARD (wall) around its borders to stop an enemy that we later learn about. This enemy is ruled by a Sage (night king) who creates these venin, monsters that are destroyed only by a special material (valerian steel) which the cadets are forging into blades!people inside the kingdom think that those creatures are just folklore. Venins have the ability to make dragon-like creatures, wyverns, that can breathe BLUE FIRE and dies immediately if their creator diesimage:And the h that has the baddest dragon has silver hair which is always in a braid🙄and thought at first to be fragile and weak!9- Dragon Riders of Pern and Eragon (edited,) I originally related it to Eragon but many friends pointed out that the whole concept of dragon riders bonding with the chosen dragon and that such a dragon can mentally communicate with its rider through witty conversations and big personality is from the mother of all Dragon stories - the Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCafferyEven the scene where V and X feel horney bec of the Dragon lust is definitely not original to The Fourth Wing10- Dragon School: Just when you think that having Voilet be a Female main lead with a disability is something original of this book, you find out it is not! Dragon School is an acclaimed YA book series by K.L Wilson published in 2017 about sixteen-year-old Amel who joins the Dominion Dragon Riders. But Amel has not only a crippled leg but also chronic disease and Dragon School training is grueling. Before she can even become an initiate, she must complete her First Flight on a dragon. Everyone around Amel thinks she will die before her first ride because of her fragile state and disability. SOUNDS FAMILIAR?Bonus courtesy of @Soyas.ReadingpalaceThis is the map of the Fourth WingThis is the map of the Witcher booksnotice anything?so, there is nothing original about this bookYou want to take the characters' descriptions? fineoh, you want to take also the plot conflict? finewhat? you want also all the famous plotlines?BUTWhat are you bringing to the table then?????Another side issue that bugged me which was the queer representation. What representation??? I didn’t see any! A representation is when you have a character or a couple of them who are queer. This book made it out as if everyone is Bi and that it is natural for everyone to jump into bed from man to woman. If this is everyone, then this is the norm of the society in the book and there is no representation.I think that this book would be enjoyed by a person who hasn’t read the above-mentioned books or doesn’t want to read them so you get to read a mash-up of them. If you are this person, then this book is perfect for youHowever, I am a reader who values authenticity not imitation done blatantly. There was no originality in either the story or the plotlineThese are some TT posting similarities with pages and story👇🏻pages from the bookfourth wing and GoThow FW was writtentimportant noteI was one of the first who read this book upon release. if you check the tiktoks I've put, you'll see that the first one was made May 15 2023, same week.Since then, I've answered so many questions in my TT account and here, and a lot of them are so repeatedSo, please, if you read this review, and find yourself wanting to comment with:1- nothing is original2- read for fun3- do your research4- it's not that serious5- why are you taking the joy out of othersI urge you to read the comments first because I won't be repeating myself for your lack of effort.What I am willing and happy to do, is have a respectful discussion. I am not trying to persuade anyone.

2,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","♡08/11/23♡“a dragon without its rider is a tragedy. a rider without their dragon is dead.”welcome to the fourth wing 🐉what is more than infinity stars? i’ll tell you what. it’s this book. besties let me just start with saying…i am a romance/dark romance girly through and through. the only other fantasy books i’ve ever read were the acotar books and that series was so good. easily one of my favorite series ever, but fourth wing? it was even better…literal chefs kiss🤌i was hooked from the very first sentence to the very last. i’ve read one of rebecca’s romance books and i loved it, but her writing fantasy?! she ate that up and left zero crumbs. this is easily one of my top reads of 2023. fourth wing was action packed and the romance was amazing.tropes:-found family-enemies to lovers-slow burn-“touch her, you die”-morally grey mmc-forced proximityaesthetic:-dragons-academic setting-divergent vibes-dystopian fantasy📖quick summary of the book:this book is about violet sorrengail, the daughter of a high ranked general. most of her life she was practicing/training to be apart of the scribe quadrant because of her love for books and her intelligence, but her mother told her that she must follow in her siblings footsteps and become a dragon rider. violet is in no way prepared for that, but she ends up going to basgiath war college to do exactly what her mother asked of her. to become a dragon rider, you must pass all these very deadly challenges that are designed to kill off the weak. while violet is trying her very best to become a dragon rider…she‘s constantly fighting her attraction for xaden riorson (her enemy that she was told to stay away from). xaden is a well respected wingleader of the fourth wing and his one goal was to kill violet because of the family she belongs to, but what happens when her life suddenly becomes tethered to his?💭my thoughts:this book was so easy to follow and it was so fast paced. i was a little intimidated because the font was small and the chapters were longer than i usually prefer, but there was not a single page in this book that was boring. i’m usually the type to see how many pages are left in a chapter, but i simply did not care. i was fully consumed by this book and got totally lost in it. the action…it caused me a LOT of anxiety, but i ate that shit up. this book had my heart RACING. there were so many parts in this book that literally took my breath away…had me forgetting how to breathe. the romance!?! ♾️/10. the angst, the spice, the banter…literally everything you want for a romance plot. the writing was absolutely amazing. the descriptive writing omg…10/10. it was so easy to picture all of the different settings and picture everything that was happening. i felt like i was sitting in the front row watching this entire book unfold. this book has so much potential to be turned into a movie omg please😭cast theo james as xaden IMMEDIATELY and then cast me as violet🤭and then let’s just erase dain completely. i adored most of the characters in this book. i love when i fall in love with side characters just as much as main characters.♡violet sorrengail (aka violence)🤭- “i am the sky and the power of every storm that has ever been. i am infinite.”- “i will not die today.”this woman. one of my all time favorite fmc’s who i admire so much. her character development was phenomenal. i swear it was the most satisfying thing about this book. as soon as she was painted to be this tiny, weak, helpless woman…i was impatiently waiting for my girl to prove everyone wrong and she DID that. i love how well she knew her own mind and was not afraid to come forward and speak it. a place like the riders quadrant is where people go and get stripped of their humanity, but i love how violet kept all her morals intact. she knows who she is and y’all she is THAT bitch. the way she had so many people wanting/trying to kill her, but she never lost sight of who she was so when it came to her having a perfect chance to end the lives of those who wanted to end hers…she didn’t want to do it. it’s not her. ahhh i just love her so much.♡xaden riorson (aka my yummy HUSBAND)- “fascinating. you look all frail and breakable, but you’re a violent little thing, aren’t you?”immediately theo james. that is who he reminds me of. THE FANART!?! HELLO? was not prepared😩xaden is a man you steer clear from and because he’s that kinda man…sign me and violet the fuck up cuz we’re THERE…on our knees for this man. he’s the type of man that raises your pulse because fear or lust…there’s no in between. xaden has so many walls up and throughout the book, violet tears those down…one by one. i loved xaden’s character from the start which is crazy to say because he made it very clear that he wanted to kill violet. but just know this…behind every villain is me falling in love with them.- “i might be a villain to some, but not you.”this man could literally run me over with his dragon and i’d still chase after him. i love his leadership and it meant so much more to me after finding out about his past. this man deserves the world. i love how protective he is and how he always challenged violet to do better and get stronger. AND HE’S FUNNY!? he had me giggling, swooning, kicking my feet, BLUSHING. this man may not be real but he gave me real butterflies in my tummy every time he spoke.🙈the romance:first things first. the spicy scenes…i’m blushing just thinking about them. they definitely live in my mind rent free. the sexual tension was REAL. the things xaden did for violet throughout this entire fucking book.- he had an entire arsenal of daggers crafted specifically for her.- he designed a saddle for tairn so that she could ride without falling to her death.- he taught her how to defend herself.- he protected her when she needed it.- he had a harness made for andarna that attaches to tairn so she could keep up with them.-he picked violets for her…😩this man is the definition of perfect. idc. i will stand by this man forever. he was one of the very few people who saw violet’s potential. he allowed her to handle herself because he knew that she could. he respected her and he showed it in more ways than one. the way he nicknamed her violence😭🤭- “she exists, and i get turned on.”- “i can’t help it. i smile. this brilliant fucking woman is mine.”- “not all strength is physical, violet.”this man seriously owns me. like i am SAT. i just love the way violet was told to stay away from xaden because he’s dangerous, but she found the most comfort with him. her trying to resist him and his attractiveness😭- “beautiful. fucking. asshole.”- “you are not attracted to toxic men, i remind myself, and yet, here i am, getting all attracted.”- “toxic. dangerous. wants to kill you. nope, doesn’t matter. my pulse still skitters like a teenager.”one of my all time favorite enemies to lovers romance i swear it was so good and written perfectly for me. i love these two endlessly🥹🤭🫂the found family:i will be talking more about the side characters, but talking about them in depth means spoilers. so let me just say this…rhiannon, aurelie, liam, heaton, sawyer, ridoc, and mira. the love i have for these characters🤭🤭then we have the dragons deigh, andarna, sgaeyl, and tairn. there is nothing i can say about them without completely spoiling a bunch of stuff so just know that the dragons are literally my favorites. they are in charge of everything that has to do with dragons and they’re all different! the excitement i have for the next books to see all these relationships grow. i wanna know more and i’m wondering if rebecca will have some of the books in this series be in some of their povs…but please i seriously wouldn’t mind having three or more books about xaden and violet, kinda like the acotar series!! but just know that there are so many characters in this book to fall in love with hehe.🎬favorite moments/scenes:“now, get back to bed before your wingleader realizes you’re out after curfew.”“what?” i gawk after him. “you’re my wingleader!”~giggling🤭“going for blood today, are we, violence?” he whispers. metal hits the mat again and he kicks it past my head and out of my reach. he’s not taking my daggers to use against me; he’s disarming me just to prove he can. my blood boils.“my name is violet.” i seethe.“i think my version fits you better.” he releases my wrist and stands offering me a hand. “we’re not done yet.”~them on the sparring mat for the first time🫠the way he taught her lessons without hurting her.then he guides our hands back to my ribs and slides the ruby-hilted blade back into its sheath. the move is unnervingly…hot.“you’re not going to disarm me?” i challenge as he releases his grip and pushes up more, removing his weight from my body. my ribs expand as i take my full first breath.“nope. defenseless women have never been my type.”~ACT FOOL ACT FOOL“oh gods.”“which one are you calling out for?” he asks against my flesh. “because it’s just you and me in this room, vi, and i don’t like to share.”“you.” my fingers tangle in his hair. “i’m calling out for you.”~fr blushing.“did you know that the first time i climbed these steps with dain, i was horrified that there wasn’t a handrail?”“did you know i can’t stand to hear his name on your lips while you’re leading the way to my room.”“you should end the enemy at your feet.”“i can’t kill an unconscious man.”“he could kill you given the same chance.”“well, that’s a statement on his character. not mine.”~I LOVE VIOLET’S CHARACTER SO MUCH.“have you always been this tall?” i blurt the first thing that comes to mind.“no, i was a child at some point.”~xaden is effortlessly funny.“you’ll have to—““i know how to handle a corset.”~that’s so hot. RUN ME OVER.“i should have killed him slower.”“i’m fine.” i’m not.“never lie to me.”~🫠pls be mine.“i just need to know what my chances are here.” my hands curl into fists. the ass has the nerve to smile.“that’s the oddest way i’ve ever been hit on—““not my chances with you, you conceited prick!”~THIS HAD ME ROLLING😭😂god he’s perfect.PSA:dain, jack, and all the other loathed characters that i don’t wanna waste time listing…WE DON’T SPEAK OF THEM HERE…unless you’re talking negatively about them. dain is literally tamlin and a redemption arc for him will not be accepted. i will forever hate dain.‼️‼️SPOILERS AHEAD‼️‼️because i can not keep my thoughts to myself any longer.♡♡♡♡tairn & andarnai was SCREAMING when tairn landed because i just knew he was going to bond with violet, but at the same time i was sad because violet had been protecting andarna so i was rooting for andarna to bond with her and then THEY BOTH BONDED WITH VIOLET. violet is her. when tairn spoke directly into violet’s mind omg i was so excited 😩- “i know exactly who and what you are, violet sorrengail.”i just love that one of the strongest dragons chose to bond with violet because of the person that she is omg.- “you will not fall. i will not allow it.”the way most dragons let their newly bonded riders fall to their death if they can’t stay on…but tairn put in extra work to keep violet on his back omg🥹tell me that tairn isn’t like violet’s second dad…and overprotective too. their bond is so precious.- “i’m proud you’re mine.”andarna is the most precious dragon i swear. finding out that she’s only two years old🥺🥺i love her so fucking much. the power she gave violet to freeze time, but if you use so much of that power, andarna could die. ugh the the way andarna trusted violet with that power. it just really goes to show how well violet carried herself throughout this book. at the end of the book, xaden said got big!! i cannot wait for for the next book.also can we just quick talk about how funny tairn actually was…- “you’re bleeding, stop it.”- “and to think, i’d almost forgotten just how loquacious humans are.”- “you’re making us look bad, stop it.”- “now get in the seat and actually hold on this time, or no one is going to believe that i’ve actually chosen you.”- “there’s no need to shout. i can hear you just fine. the entire mountain can probably hear you.”- “pronunciation could use some work.”- “you’re worthy. at least i think you are, but you apparently don’t pay attention in class.”- “the closest translation for humans is probably ‘for fuck’s sake.’ now. are you going to stay in your seat this time?”- “stubborn silver human.”- “you only fell about a dozen times that trip.”- “this grumpy ass just caught you a dozen times, silver one.”- “and i could call you violence like the wingleader.”- “tell him if he harms you, i’ll scorch the ground where he stands. tell him, or i’ll take it up with cath. word for word, silver one.”- “i hear it’s all the fashion.”- “should i get the wingleader?”- “if they try anything, they’ll be a snack.”TAIRN IS SO PERFECT. i’m cackling. he’s effortlessly funny just like xaden🤭♡sgaeyl- “they’re a mated pair, tairn and sgaeyl. the strongest bonded pair in centuries.”SCREAMINGGGG! oh xaden…how your plans have changed.- “i belong to tairn and andarna…and, in some really fucked up way…xaden.”yes violet, yes you do. i love the way sgaeyl can talk directly into violet’s mind too. usually dragons can only do that to their own riders, but tairn and sgaeyl have such a strong bond🤭so now they’re all a lil family🥹guys xaden and violet being able to speak directly into each others minds. i SCREAMEDDDD. also xaden’s pov for the very last chapter😭i hope the next book has more of his pov!!🎬favorite moment that spoils too much:“what changed?” frustration tightens my grip on the mug. “when exactly did you decide not to ruin me?”“maybe it was when i saw oren holding a knife to your throat,” he says. “or maybe it was when i realized the bruises on your neck were fingerprints and wanted to kill them all over again just so i could do it slowly. maybe it was the first time i recklessly kissed you or when i realized i’m fucked because i can’t stop thinking about doing more than just kissing you.”violet being able to wield lighting and xaden wields shadows…i love their signets so much!THE BETRAYALS ahhhhh i’m so glad rebecca patched things up for the most part between xaden and violet because idk what i would’ve done if THAT was the cliffhanger. now i know i said we don’t speak of dain here but i’m about to drag this bitch through the fucking mud really quick. he was literally supposed to be violet’s best friend. i despise this man, IT SHOULD’VE BEEN HIM AND NOT LIAM. he consistently put violet down and made her feel like she wasn’t good enough to become a dragon rider and then he has the audacity to kiss her and shit and claim that he has feelings for her!? bro what. he’s actually the shittiest person. and then he stole violet’s memory. without her consent. she full on trusted this guy.- “i’ve unknowingly betrayed xaden…betrayed them all.”THIS HURT ME OK. violet finding out about xaden’s betrayal, and then dain’s betrayal, and then her feeling as if she betrayed all of them. it was too much.rebecca…listen to me😭the AUDACITY you had to make me fall in love with liam and then brutally rip him away from me. i could not stop crying. i want to cry right now thinking about it. he was such a fun character. he was literally violet’s protector ugh he was so sweet and flirty. i’m so pissed because i thought maybe rebecca was hinting at a little romance between liam and jesinia or am i the only one who thought that??? this is how y’all know i’m such a slut for romance. i just be pairing characters together after one little interaction lmao. but :( ugh it’s gonna take me a little bit to forgive you, rebecca. that death hurt me like no other and then when xaden found out, i cried HARDER. UHHHHH I’M ON TIKTOK AND MY FYP DID ME DIRTY and showed me fanart of liam his death scene…why!? what did i do to deserve that :(guys, violet’s brother being alive…i cannot stop thinking about the next book. i seriously need it right now. i need to know everything. i’m honestly glad this was the cliffhanger tho because it’s not a devastating one hehe.‼️‼️SPOILERS OVER‼️‼️♡♡♡i am not a fantasy girly. i loved acotar, but after i finished that series i was like okay i think that’ll be enough fantasy for me, but after reading fourth wing?! i crave more. correct me if i’m wrong, but isn’t this rebecca’s first fantasy series???? if so, she absolutely killed it. i could not put this book down. i felt like every chapter left on a mini cliffhanger and i needed to keep reading. besties, this book is a must read😭not everyone is going to love it, but give it a try because it could be your newest favorite, like it is mine🤭♡favorite quotes:- “there’s no where in existence you could go that i wouldn’t find you, violence.”- “none of this is worth it without you.”- “i am annoyingly aware of everything you do.”- “i am completely, utterly obsessed with xaden.” GIRL SAME🤭- “and when others are quick to stand in front of me, xaden always stands at my side, trusting me to hold me own.” perfect bf🥹- “stop. fucking. coddling. her.” yes babe, you tell dain👏- “we can love as cowards or die as riders.”- “gets-you-into-trouble-and-you-like-it level of hot.”- “fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.” screaming- “stop being so fucking honorable and fuck me, xaden.” i-wow yeah i’d say the same thing.- “i fucking love your hair. if you ever want to bring me to my knees or win an argument, just let it down. i’ll get the point.” STOP IT RN. i’m obsessed with his obsession with her.- “everything between us is real, violence.”- “she doesn’t need to hide behind me when she’s bonded to the most powerful dragon of your year.”- “you get to feel however you want within these walls.”- “you’re going to be the death of me.”- “welcome to the revolution, violet.” SCREAMINGGGGGGGGGGGa big thank you to my bestie🩵giuliana🩵for buddy reading this book with me! the way she sent me the fanart of xaden, we were SCREAMINGGGG. so my bestie has been super busy and because she’s the sweetest she let me finish the book a little bit before her. i couldn’t help myself, i literally devoured this book. her review will be up soon hehe. love you baeeeee!",5
3,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","5 ⭐️ If Throne of Glass, Divergent, Eragon, and Zodiac Academy had a baby. . . but this is better!!!*PS: I don't really even like ZA, but it's similar because of the academic setting, the heroine's journey to understanding her strength, and the enemies-to-lovers aspect (it's not quite a bully romance though).You know when you finish a book, and it leaves an ache in your chest because it was so good, and now it’s over? Yeah, that’s exactly how I feel after finishing Fourth Wing.Summary:There are only two ways to leave Basgiath War College: graduate or die. ⁠⁠Violet was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant and live a quiet life among books. However, when her mother, the commanding general, forces her to join the Riders Quadrants to become a dragon rider, she must push herself past all limitations in order to survive. ⁠⁠Staying alive would be a lot easier if Violet didn't have a target on her back for not only being 'small and frail' but the daughter of the woman responsible for the deaths of many cadet's traitorous parents, including Xaden Riorson's - the most powerful and ruthless wingleader. She should stay away from him, but a fire burns between these two that is bound to consume them both. ⁠⁠With stakes this high, every day could be her last. So Violet must learn to do the one thing she was never trained to do: fight. ⁠""I will not die today."" -Violet Sorrengail⁠WHAT TO EXPECT:✨ adult romantasy✨ true enemies to lovers✨ war college setting✨ dragon riders✨ magic✨ underdog fmc / chronic illness rep✨ scarred anti-hero mmc✨ unique world building✨ complex politics✨ found family✨ high stakes✨ insta-lust with slow burn✨ 2/5 🌶️ (2 explicit spicy scenes)✨ cliffhanger endingMy Thoughts:I am utterly obsessed! Mark my words, this is the next big romantasy series!The writing is easy to digest, the world-building is fascinating, the heroine is an underdog and total badass, and the romance develops at a believable pace and is scorching! I laughed. I cried. And I fell in love. This book will forever live in my head rent-free! ⁠Violet Sorrengail is a secret badass!I LOVE her!!!!! She’s a twenty-year-old bookworm who’s expected to live a life as a scribe but now must survive and become a dragon rider. Physically, she’s smaller and frailer than the other cadets in the quadrant, but that doesn’t make her weak. Her mind is her strength and what she needs to survive. I love how Violet handles her situation with courage and grace and how she creates meaningful relationships at the risk of her own heart. She’s extremely relatable, and I can’t wait to see how she grows.Xaden Riorson...this man has easily become one of my top book boyfriends of all time!The son of a traitor, he’s out for revenge against Violet, whose mother led to his father's death. From a distance, he’s a scary, scarred, intense anti-hero, but deep down, he’s a man who is loyal, caring, and wise. And the way this man obsesses with Violet….damn. You truly don’t know if he wants to kill or f*ck her, probably both, but yeah, it’s hot! The things I would let this man do to me. 🥵The enemies-to-lovers romance was perfect, with an intense slow burn and eventually spice!I appreciated the time it took for these two to finally get together. And when they finally do, it’s explosive! Thank goodness this is new adult fantasy because the things Xaden says and did go straight to my core, lol.The dragons stole my heart.I don’t want to say too much because it would spoil some of the books, but they are terrifying and amazing!!! They have their own hierarchy and politics, which we don’t see much of since they’re very secretive, but it’s fascinating how they decide to bond with humans to create a symbiotic relationship that ultimately helps protect the land. Can't wait to learn more about them in the next book!The found family aspect was done so well!As a dragon rider, you're encouraged not to form strong attachments since most people in your school will either die before becoming riders or later on during battle. But Violet goes against this and finds her ride or dies - specifically Rhiannon and Liam! 💕The world building so easy to understand yet very interesting.I’ve never actually read a series focused on dragons and dragon riders, so this was new and exciting for me! It was so interesting learning about the different quadrants - scribe, rider, healer, and infantry - and the schooling required for each. Obviously, this story focuses more on the Riders Quadrant, which honestly is the most exciting because it's so intense, challenging, and cutthroat. I personally don’t know if I’d survive, but maybe if I had a friend like Violet, it would be possible!PS: For all you Manon and Abraxos fans out there, you’re going to fall in love with this world!!!For the most part, the story was a bit predictable, but it’s all done in a way that I was entertained and excited to keep reading!I mean, we've seen similar stories where the seemingly weak heroine finds herself in a kill-or-be-killed situation and has to learn to fight and ultimately ends up thriving. So in that regard, you can guess where the story is heading.HOWEVER . . .That ENDING was everything I was not expecting!Those last 50 pages were absolutely epic and blew my fucking mind!!!!!! I DID NOT see that ending coming! I cried and then was left stunned by that last sentence. It's a cliffhanger, but it'll leave you more in shock instead of in pain, so don't be afraid of it! It's brutal and will make you want to immediately pick up the next book. Luckily we don't have to wait for long since the release date is November 7, 2023!But with everything I love, there are a few things I didn't like . . .Sometimes, the wording Violet used to concerning Xaden was a bit repetitive and immature.She kept describing him as beautiful and hot anytime he crossed her mind or showed up. I wish she would have used other words from time to time.The reader has to essentially piece together why Xaden falls for Violet.It’s quickly explained later in the story, but by then, it felt like we were being told more than shown. I would have liked for him to verbalize it more during the story. At least, more than him just saying things like “I can’t stay away from you”or “you’ll be the f*cking death of me”. Every time he's say those things, I was like, tell me why, though!Overall, Fourth Wing is an epic story that you will devour! I wouldn’t say this is a perfect 5-star read, maybe it’s closer to 4.5 since it wasn’t ‘perfect’, but honestly, I don't care. I haven’t read a fantasy I felt this way about in a long time, so I'm giving it all the stars.Thank you, Entangled Publishing, for sending me an arc copy in exchange for a review.

4,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","1.5/5New half-year resolution. I need to stop taking recommendations from Booktok.I’m not gonna to lie here. If this series hadn't been raved about everywhere I looked online, I probably wouldn't have read it. I’m trying to stop reading TikTok popular books, but the rating in this book made me picked it up. Fourth Wing was my first Rebecca Yaros book so I didn't know what to expect. At least now I know that this will be my first and last book by this author, because it turned out not to be for me.This review probably won't cover all the things I didn't like about it, as I started skipping pages after about sixty percent of the book.So what exactly didn’t work out for me in this book?The story didn’t hooked me up from the beginning at all. The main reason for this is probably because the writing style didn't speak out to me. I actually dnfed it the day before, but decided to give it a chance, because I thought it might be not my day for this book. At one point I was glad I decided to give it a chance, but it didn’t last long. Around forty percent I was pretty invested in the story when the dragons finally appeared. Unfortunately, it turned out I was only interested when the dragons were involved. The rest was just boring for me.The second thing is that I felt no connection to the characters. Literally nothing. Violet had some great moments, but sometimes I was embarrassed by her actions. The example.“Glad to see our year apart hasn’t dulled your tongue, Vi.”“Oh,” I toss over my shoulder as we walk into the hallway, “I can do quite a few things with my tongue. You’d be impressed.”That line sounded like a horny frat boy.Also, if you didn’t get it that she was short and tiny, the author kept reminding you of that, because that information was indeed very important.""I’m too short.""“So she’s small.” Mom scans me up and down""""Good gods, I don’t even reach his collarbone.""""I’m shorter than most.""“You’re pretty small for a rider, but it looks like you made it.”""I’m at a disadvantage, that I’m too small to climb its foreleg and mount,""“You’re tiny.” He says it like an insult""""I’m the smallest of our squad""“I’m too short for the ramp,” I whisper to Rhi.""“I’m too short to span the distance!” I hiss, uncaring that anyone could hear us.""‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎That's only from twenty-six percent of the book. I did not include the rest, because I would not have enough space for the rest of the review.Moving to Xaden, aka your typical fantasy hero. Seriously. He was your usual tall, black haired, with strong sharp jaw, muscled body, but this time he was riding dragons. I almost forgot. He was -""Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-into-trouble-and-you-like-it level of hot.""You get the picture. He was also tall. I've written about it before, but we've also been reminded of it a lot. I had to mention that sentence he said here, because I was laughing my ass off at that moment.""You have incredibly touchable skin.”Touchable skin? What does it mean bro?Honestly, the dragons were more interesting than the main characters here. If the book was about Tairn, I'd probably be more eager to read it. This dragon had better personality than both of them. At least for me though. Tairn was literally my favorite character here. That says a lot about how much I enjoyed this book.The last thing is the romance between Xaden and Violet. This series is supposed to have five books and they already done the deed, are in love - probably because I didn't make it to this part - and have a strong connection - again, probably because I didn't make it to this part. I thought that at least their first meeting, which is usually quite important, will be more spectacular. But, no. They met in the fourth percent of the book and I was like""Well, that’s it? Already?"". They were supposed to be enemies to lovers. The reasoning behind it made even sense, but they deliverednothing.I felt no chemistry between them, no tension - especially the sexual one, and no hatred that they should feel towards each other as enemies. Almost every time Violet saw Xaden it went like that.""I hate him so much""‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎""But he is so sexy and beautiful and sexy""Not even their first kiss and the cute nickname the hero usually gives the heroine saved them. The first kiss happened after Violet found out they can feel when their dragons bang each other.Yes, they could feel their dragons banging.This information made me feel quite uncomfortable. Extremely even. I know they could get rid of that with some magic or whatever, but just why? The nickname ""Violence"" that Xaden called Violet was tacky and the book could easily have survived without it. Not to mention this line.""you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”My only thought wasFrom Blood and Ash. It sounds damn similar. Even though I only read the first book from this series.Moving forward to the things I liked.The dragons.Ending my review, all I will say is that I am pretty sad and disappointed that I didn’t end up liking this book. I wanted to start a new fantasy series that I would be obsessed with, but I guess we can't have everything we want. I’m happy for people who loved it though. Good for you guys.",1
5,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","If I had a million dollars for every cliche in this book, of which there are a multitude, I'd still regret spending $20 on all 498 pages of this mess.Spoilers to follow :)Let's start with the worldbuilding!Now, this book had two things I love dearly: dragons, and an academic setting. Yarros, however, explains almost every element of her world so poorly and sporadically that the entire story feels as though it were concocted page by page. The hierarchy of squadrons and sections and wings is so unnecessarily confusing. The whole ""war"" going on along the border is so vague, it was obvious from the start that some twist was going to reveal the good guys were actually the bad guys all along. The author's primary method of exposition is dropping pieces of information into conversations that feel forced and completely unnatural. No one talks like that. No one shares information like that.Now, the writing!The sentence constructions alone were enough to give me a headache. I can't tell you how many times I had to reread entire paragraphs because of poorly written and run-on sentences. As for the dialogue, let's discuss the fact that everyone talks like it's 2023, despite the medieval setting. I'm not kidding, the female character asks herself at least twice, using these exact words, ""Is it toxic that I like this guy even though he can kill me?"" Yes. Yes it is. And so is all this internal monologuing. Please, end my suffering. Apart from the sentences and dialogue, the descriptions were severely lacking. Every location felt like a vague impression rather than an actual place. I don't think I've ever encountered a book suffering from white room syndrome quite like this one.Now for the characters. Oh, the characters.Starting with the main event, we have frail young Violet who is SO relatable because she's SO clumsy and SO bad at things! Simultaneously, she is SO smart (like smarter than everyone) and SO unique that she gets not one, but TWO dragons to bond with her! And of course, they're both the rarest kind of dragons that exist!!! And naturally, everyone wants her dead for... reasons. But does her life being in danger give her any sense of self control? Absolutely not! She argues with everyone and throws her sass around to both peers and superior officers with little to no consequence. This woman has the survival skills of a fruit fly!! Additionally, her moods go back and forth quicker than an Olympic ping-pong match. First she hates Xaden because he's a traitor. Then she loves Xaden because she decides to trust him. Then she hates Xaden because he's a traitor. I'm expecting the cycle will continue in Book 2. Also, she starts off wanting to be a scribe and gets pissed when she's thrown into the Rider's Quadrant, then she decides she desperately wants to be a Rider because... because? The decision is given hardly any explanation or emotional weight.And then there's discount Rhsysand. Oh wow, the moody black-haired rebel with tattoos is actually the good guy. Shocking. He's hard on the outside, but a softie on the inside. Groundbreaking. Also, the way that Yarros writes his character from Violet's perspective is downright sickening at times. From the very first scene with him, Violet's internal thoughts about Xaden are grossly objectifying. Everything is about his body, and how hot he is, and how badly she wants to sleep with him. There's an entire scene spanning two pages where Violet and another woman are straight-up ogling shirtless Xaden while he's sparring with another guy. It's disgusting. If the roles were reversed, if a male author wrote about a male character viewing a woman in the same way, heads would be rolling. It's gross, and frankly one of the most disappointing things about this book.Honestly, none of the other characters were interesting enough to write about. The dragons were fine, and probably the most likeable. Sawyer was the only human I found tolerable. Dain was just annoying, as he was clearly meant to be.Now, the plot.The majority of this book was consumed by Violet being horny and a random series of challenges. There was no explanation anywhere of what the academic year would look like, which makes me think the author was just making up more challenges and battles and war games as she went along. All of this, of course, leading up to a real challenge where we find out information that was abundantly obvious from the start. Oh no, the good guys are the bad guys. The bad guys are the good guys. The dead brother is actually alive. I wish I cared about any of this, but I don't because it's been so blatantly obvious since the first chapter. The pacing of this book was tedious in a lot of places because there wasn't really any kind of looming threat beyond the vague allusions to bigger attacks along the border. Nothing in this book surprised me. Nothing came even remotely close. Everything was so over-ridden with cliches and ideas from other books (mainly Divergent, and a little bit of Red Queen with the not-dead-brother ending) that nothing felt original or creative at all.I have searched earnestly, to the farthest hills on the horizon, for something good in this book. Alas, I return to my homeland empty-handed.And here's the thing: I so desperately wanted to enjoy this book, which makes it all the more disappointing. If you've made it this far, I want you to know I did not approach this book with the intention of feeling this way. If you enjoyed this book, kudos to you. Feel free to keep on enjoying it. These are just my thoughts and opinions, and I'll content myself to be the cranky grandma of Goodreads if need be. But good heavens, am I glad this is over with.",1
6,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","UPDATE-STFU IT'S BEING DEVELOPED INTO A TV SERIES 🤯😱""A dragon without its rider is a tragedy.A rider without their dragon is dead.""✅Rereaddone right (Aug 2023)I loved it as much as I did it the first time I read it, in fact I loved it more. Picked up on a lot of foreshadowing. Rebecca Yarros is a truly talented writer, the emotions I felt reading it were so genuine, I was fully immersed. The characters and the story are fire.I loved Xaden and Violet even more, hated Dain with passion, Tairn and Adarana continue to be badasses and Liam...I got no words, I love that guy.~•~•~ORIGINAL REVIEW 👇(May 2023)THIS BOOK🤌🤌 Y'all believe me it's worth the money. I am in loveeeeee, easily the best book I read this year and one of the best romantasy I've read in a while. Books like this are the reason I fell in love with reading.Let's just jump right in, cause am excited to write this review.Read if you like-✔️ Zodiac Academy✔️ Divergent✔️ Throne of Glass✔️ Dragons🐉✔️ Academia setting (war college)✔️ High fantasy✔️ Chronic illness rep✔️ Enemies to lovers✔️ Slow burn✔️ Spice (3.5/5) 🌶️""... There's nowhere in existence you could go that I wouldn't find you, Violence.""Trained to be in the Scribe Quadrant, theFMC- Violet,found herself in the Riders Quadrant- the most elite of Navarre, where survival is of the fittest and the strongest. All she needs to do is not get killed and bond with a dragon, but it's not as easy. Not only she has to escape the clutches of the students who want her dead, with few dragons willing to bond; she also has to keep away fromXaden, MMCwho wants her dead.From page 1 till page 633 I was hooked. Theworld buildingis detailed and well thought out. Theplotis consistent and true to itself. Thepacing,fluctuates a bit in the second half but mostly stays fast paced for the majority of the book.""Tell me what you're thinking?""""I was thinking you are exactly as I predicted the first time you took me in my room.""""Oh yeah? And what was that?""""A very dangerous addiction.""Coming to thecharacters-⚡Violet-I loved her. She's brave, compassionate, goes to lengths to protect others and knows how to stand up for herself and others. Having had chronic illness, people always underestimate her(all but one)but that's what makes her an underdog. I liked how balanced her character and personality was, never over the top. Loved following her journey through the war school and boy how she developed and grew in those pages.🖤Xaden-Idk if anyone else is saying this but I will- Xaden has the same vibe that Warwick from Savage Lands does, but Xaden does it better. There's just something about their personality that's so similar. Give the Savage Lands series a go if you liked Xaden. Anyway, I loved him so much. He's a badass. Once her started opening up, and we got to see the softer side of him- I was swooning. He's powerful, sexy, and knows when to pick his battles, certainly not a push over.Dain-What an ass. Radiates the same energy as Tamlin in ACOMAF.The othersupporting charactersare good as well, they grow on ya- especially the dragons and Liam. Tairn and Adarana have my heart. I loved them since the first time they spoke. They have a sense of humour, are badass and protect so fiercely. Saegyl was okay-ish, not much of her tbh.Now I want a dragon 😭""I'm going to keep you. You're mine, Violet.""""Only if you're mine.""""I've been yours for longer than you could ever imagine."" ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥Theromance is an angsty slow burn, enemies to lovers with spiceand oh how brilliantly it was executed 🥰 I was all in my feels, swooning and melting and basically loved it. And if you like thecharacters being jealous,you'll enjoy that trope here too. I do think there was a pinch of ""who did this to you"" but wasn't that impactful. Xaden and Violet'schemistryis off the charts. They compliment each other so well and I like how open and honest they are with each other, and that both of them don't hold each other back and give the other room to make mistakes, learn and grow. It is a mature relationship yeah. Also, thesmutwas hot.. no seriously, things did get hot and broken down 🤭Theendingwas an emotional rollercoaster. I was crying so much at one point, had to take deep breaths to resume reading. I cannot wait for the sequel 🤩It's such a masterpiece in my opinion. I haven't felt this in love and so strongly about a book in a while and am so genuinely happy I read this 😭😭❤️It's a binge worthy action packed romantasy with never a dull moment. You are missing out if you haven't read this. Idk what are you all doing, GO READ IT! I promise it won't disappoint.Y'all think Amazon will have a dragon? 🤔~•~•~I have no words. I'm gonna take some time to collect my thoughts. But WOW.~•~•~Y'all I know I just started reading this but am already in love. I predict 4-5 star rating, hopefully that will be the case.",5
7,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","Re-read bc we are so close to Iron Flame!!Update on my re-read! Loved it as much as the first 3 times I read it! AND WE ARE ONLY DAYS AWAY FROM IRON FLAME!!!""A dragon without its rider is a tragedy. A rider without its dragon is dead.""-Article One, Section One. The Dragon Rider's Codex🐉Well, you guys all know how excited I have been for this book release since I haven't been exactly subtle about it, so the big question is, did it meet my unreasonably high expectations? The answer is NO......... because this book exceeded my expectations. WOW!!! What an absolute wild ride! Obsessed is the only word I have to describe how I feel about this book. Every page, every word had me on the edge of my seat, and this book elicits every emotion from you. The absolute unflinching brutality the characters face is both addictive and shocking, but there are also so many triumphs and heart squeezing moments. I am not exaggerating when I say this is my favorite fantasy read this year if not in many years! I can't wait for the next installment to come out bc that ENDING!!!""It seems.... cruel, but the first rule of living at Basgaith is never question a dragon. They tend to cremate anyone they find rude."" -Violet20-year-old, Violet Sorrengail, was never supposed to be facing risking her life in the most brutal and deadly program at Basgiath War College. She has trained her whole life to be scribe but when her mother, a General and the head commander at Basgiath orders her to sign up as a Dragon Rider cadet her odds of survival aren't looking too good. All the odds are stacked against her, from a condition that affects her bones and ligaments that leaves her in chronic pain to the brutal and unforgiving dragons that kill without mercy to her fellow cadets who are just as blood thirsty and willing to kill her to even the odds. Certain death seems to be around every corner. Violet is not going down without a fight though, and she will do everything she can to defy the odds to earn her spot and above all a DRAGON!""But I will not run. I wouldn't be standing here if I'd quit every time something seemed impossible to overcome. I will not die today.""-Violet""I'm used to functioning in pain asshole. Are you?"" -VioletViolet- I don't say this lightly, but Violet Sorrengail is among my all-time favorite fmc's ever. She is the embodiment of determination, grit and bravery. Her willingness to bet on herself time and again when so many around her keep telling her she will never be good enough is so inspiring. You can't help but root for her as the quintessential underdog bc she never lets herself be a victim despite her physical limitations. She feels like the blueprint for my favorite kind of fmc.""Killing you wouldn't be any trouble Violence. It's leaving you alive that seems to cause the majority of my trouble."" -Xaden""Now earn your nickname and try your best to kill me""-XadenXaden- Xaden is the most powerful and brutal Wing leader at the academy and also the main person likely to kill Violet while she is in the Riders Quadrant seeing as how her mother had his father executed for treason. I love Xaden, he only gets more interesting as the story goes on and the heat between Violet and him is hotter than the dragon fire!!! And his signet power is always on my checklist!! (can't say what it is but it's GOOD really, really GOOD) And his nickname for Violet! 🫠🫠Presentation Day is unlike any other. The air is ripe with possibilities, and possibly the stench of sulfur from a dragon who has been offended. Never look a red in the eye. Never back down from a green. If you show trepidation to a brown......well, just don't."" -Colonel Kaori's Field Guide to Dragonkind.The DragonsThey are AMAZING. Lethal, terrifying, and spectacular. They blew my mind, and that's all I can really say bc I refuse to spoil anything. 🐉🐉🐉""People die, it's going to happen over and over again. It's the nature of what happens here. What makes you a rider is what you do after people die."" -Xaden"" This place can warp almost everything about a person Vi. It cuts away the bullshit and the niceties, revealing whoever you are at your core."" - DainFriends- There are so many great supporting characters that I completely fell in love with and the camaraderie and rivalry between the riders is such a significant part of the story bc you can feel the tension and the anxiety of their circumstances throughout the entire book.Rebecca Yarros has expertly written such a thrilling and compelling introduction book to this wonderful world of dragons and their riders, and I can't wait to see where the story continues!! Is it too early to start the countdown clock for the next book?!!Please check TW besties as this book deals with themes of Violence and War.",5
8,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","I’m sorry, but it’s a no from me.It’s always a case of you questioning yourself when a hyped book doesn’t work for you.But I have reasons and regrets and I want a refund. Of my time and money.I can’t decide whether to rate this 2 or 1 ⭐️.It’s a 1 ⭐️ rating. 🤦🏾‍♀️I’m about to drop some truth bombs,so if this is the type of book for you in where you don’t want to hear any form of slander, then look away.I’m going to be honest about my reading experience, which wasn’t all that great.😓It seems that fantasy romances, whether they’re adult or YA, have been using the same formula these past few years in where the focus solely lies on the plot and the action scenes and the same attention isn’t given to the characters and their world. And I do not understand why that is the case. The balance between them all is off.The characters (all of them, not a single one was interesting) lacked substance, background and history. So by nature, I’m not even remotely interested in rooting for them and seeing them overcome the challenges they’re facing, because they are so poorly developed to begin with.The foundation of this world felt unbelievably flimsy and read messy to me. It was supposed to feel dangerous, the stakes were supposed to be high. Characters were being killed left, right and centre and the only thing I felt was nothing.There was no order to the way it was being built upon. Just chaos, convenience and stupidity all round.Violet’s character could’ve been made more interesting (to me) if:▪️We had we seen her time as a scribe before she was forced to become a rider.▪️See her actually train and get stronger.▪️See how she generally fought through her chronic pain.▪️See her deal with the grief of her brother.▪️Explore the weird dynamic she has with her mother.▪️See the friendships forming and the romance truly developing.▪️See her fuckin’ bonding with those dragons.All of these things would’ve added nuance and depth to her characterisation, to the actual story itself. Are we privy to any of that? No. Those aspects are mentioned and that’s supposed to be good enough whereas I would’ve liked layers.Characters shouldn’t read so one-dimensional.And enemies-to-lovers where? Please. 🙄 This trope was used in the most juvenile way.You could argue that the romance itself was juvenile.We could’ve honed in on the hate since both these characters suffered losses, come from different and opposing backgrounds, have some real animosity and tension built between them but the love interest was hardly ever present.Next thing you know, the trope was flung out the window instead of it being morphed into something real.So, I fail to understand why this was sold as a fantasy romance.I can’t tell you why these two liked each other, let alone love. There was no development ofgenuine, romantic feelings.There was a buildup of attraction and supposed sexual tension. But that’s it.Another thing that bugged me is that we only got Violet’s perspective. I mean, this occasionally works, but ideally,no fantasy book should have a singular POV.I can’t begin to tell you how boring that narrative is.It gives such a limiting and subjective view of the world and the characters, and this especially gets more limiting when there are other characters present that also play a significant role in the story.Yet they weren’t utilised.Is it that hard to give different perspectives?The dragons were theONLYinteresting parts about this whole book.But they didn’t even get as much page time as they should’ve. They deserved more page time. I mean, if you’re going to have them talking, give them a POV as least. They could’ve told us about their own history.There were also some language choices that were made that felt odd in a fantasy setting.“Personally, I’m not arguing with their logic, just enjoying the view…respectfully, of course…”“So. Freaking. Beautiful.”“Holy. Fuckin. Hot.”No one talks like that in a fantasy world. 😒You know damn well some of this lingo doesn’t belong here. It’s so embarrassing and a testament to bad writing and bad editing.To top it all off, I still don’t know whether this was adult, new adult or YA fantasy. I couldn’t tell you. Goodreads has them all listed. Clearly, everyone is confused.In conclusion, all of this to say that this brand of poorly written, poorly developed fantasy story is just not for me. This book was not for me. I had a really difficult time immersing myself into the story.The ending was somewhat interesting, but by that point I was skim-reading. And I don’t care about this book enough to continue on with the series. I want to forget I ever read it.I’m avoiding all hyped books for the foreseeable future. 😪💔",1
9,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","0/5⭐️😍 OMG THIS IS THE (second) WORST BOOK IVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE!!!🥰I’ve posted my iron flame review!! You can go read it if you liked this one :)Violet Sorrengail. Get it? SOARING-GALE BECAUSE DRAGONS SOAR ON GALES 🧍🏻‍♀️ THATS SO CLEVER.She’s like so badass because she’s like so dainty and like so small and has insert name chronic illness which makes her so badass and a really good candidate for a WAR SCHOOL. She is totally not a self-insert of the author because unlike the author she doesn’t have blonde hair, she has ultra special brown hair that turns a really rare silver as she gets older. (Because hair pigment works like that🤭)She’s also so super really fast because she’s SOO petite and small and little and fragile.And also the love interest is SOO much bigger than her and he’s the most powerful darkness-wielding highlord—oh sorry I mean dragon rider at the academy.because Violet being the daughter of the literal leader of the school wasn’t enough, she also gets a super mega rare giant black dragon AND a never-before-seen golden useless ass feathertailed baby dragon that has the ability to manipulate time. And don’t worry, Violet can summon lightning just in case you were concerned that Mare Barrow was the most obnoxious lightning wielder.Rebecca Yarrows is such a good writer 😍 all of her world building and info dumps are so unbearable to read!! Plus her writing is entirely YA and juvenile except for the horrific car crash level sex scenes that happen 80% into the book. What a slay!!All of her characters make me want to rip my eyeballs out🥰 but especially Xaden because he’s so tortured and scary and so much bigger than our poor baby fragile pathetic paper-boned protagonist Violet soaring-gale.The enemies to lovers is also so well done!! They were literally never even enemies😍 and I didn’t once believe they felt anything other than the most surface level lust for the other🤭Also why the fuck did Yarrows decide that when the dragons fuck that their riders also get really horny? That was information I did not ever need.The world building was so amazingly perfect!! I loved how she info dumped entire paragraphs of exposition and random facts onto us, but still never managed to outline how the actual school worked or why the fuck the gryphons couldn’t just be incinerated by the giant ass dragons with literal magic!!!!😍Oh, I also really enjoyed how the single black character with any personality was not only bisexual but hyper sexual and slept around with everyone!!! It was really great how Rhiannon was sidelined the entire novel so that Violet could also be useless!I also love how we don’t get to know anything about any of the side characters because Violet is too concerned with fucking Xaden!! 🥵The nickname of “Violence” for Violet, the character that literally did not kill a single person until the 75% mark also made a lot of sense!! I’m so glad she was at a war school and wasn’t required to kill a single person or even ever actually train without cheating her way through by poisoning her opponents!! She will totally not die in actual combat when she can’t sneak random ass made-up poisons into her opponents’ meals!! 😝I think it’s also so inspiring how Violet’s tiny 90 pound frame literally could not support swinging an 11 pound sword, but the dragons did not murder her for being weak (her words not mine) because she was so strong mentally because she complained about being in pain (despite claiming to be used to pain?) and so delicate and fragile all the time!! 🤩Also let’s just not talk about how Violet totally plays into the “toxic perseverance” trope by actively ignoring the symptoms and effects her disability has on her body and powers through everything because she’s “used to pain”!! That’s so good and such a good example to set <3It could have been interesting if Violet actually found ways to accommodate for her weaknesses/disadvantages that made sense, but clearly Yarros doesn’t actually give a fuck so she didn’t bother. The only example we have of this is a saddle which I’m sorry is stupid as fuck because why was everyone not already using saddles?? Did Miss Rebecca ever look into how fucking uncomfortable it can be not use a saddle or padding while riding horses much less consider how painful it might be to ride a giant, roughly scaled DRAGON that is FLYING THROUGH THE SKY?? 🙈This book was so incredible😍 I can’t believe booktok didn’t force this down everyone’s throats sooner!! It was so great to read this horrendous amalgamation of shitty world building, horrifically atrocious writing, and one dimensional characters with a nonsensical plot and a underdeveloped romance!!Legitimately the worst book I’ve ever read. I would unkindly ask Rebecca Yarros to never write another word in her life.",1
10,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","— 5 stars ✰I LOVE YOU REBECCA YARROS”you gave me your heart, and i’m keeping it.i knew i was going to love this book. the amount of five star reviews & the talk aboutfourth wingon social media had me intrigued since the beginning & i’mhappyto confirm that this book is indeed worth the hype. like, mind-blowing-amazing 🫡dragon, dragon-school, competition, tension, enemies to lovers, you get thrown right into the plot, you have amazing antagonists. this book was purelyperfection. everything your heart desires, you’ll get it. nothing better than a fantasy novel with a subplot of romance, a good plot twist and am amazing cliffhanger. yes, you heard correctly. a cliffhanger. i might die right here right then because how am i supposed to wait that long for the sequel to come out?PLS GIVE ME THE SEQUEL NOW!! 🫠🫠—xadenriorsen. the man of the hour. the moment he appeared, i fell in love with him. i might be exaggerating but who cares, right? it’s the way violet describes him, i mean, how could you not fall in love with a brooding dragon rider who has a cut through his eyebrow. what makes him even hotter is the fact that he is the leader of the forth wing and oh my god, his “welcoming” speech.. i don’t know how yarros managed to make himthishot in a few sentences only. it’s his confidence. yes, that must be it. totally not his broad shoulders. or his rank. or his dark hair.“i had it made for you.” his lips curve slightly.his love language has to be acts of service. this man might have taken a while to admit his feelings but the things he did for violet? unbelievable. he was so ruined for her & i was so ready for it.—violet, my beloved. i justlovedhow everyone underestimated her and then she showed them what’s beneath that “fragile” body everyone seems to think she has. what i enjoyed most about her was that we saw her development, saw her fight for the place in the school and proving everyone wrong. she has a good sense of humor and wit, making me giggle — especially when she was flirting with a certain someone.“there’s a fucking smirk onxaden’s arrogant, handsome face.”there were so many chapters i enjoyed that were purely about violet without any mention of xaden & that means so much to me. there have been so many fantasy books were i was just so bored out of my mind when the love interest wasn’t there bc not everyone knows how to write a badass fmc with a great personality. rebecca yarros absolutely nailed it tho. the plot is just so gripping, you get sucked into their story and just want to read more about their world.as i am a big fan of game of thrones & house of the dragons, this book was a total hit for me. i loved reading about the dragons, the different breeds, their history, their shape and color and abilities.—xaden and violet. violet and xaden. you know who they reminded of? tris and four. the young new girl everyone scoffs at, the intimidating older guy everyone fears. also let’s not forget that xaden was the only person mira told violet to stay away from 🤭 their first interactions were so full of tension already, i was giggling and blushing and they’ve only changed a few words by then.”going for blood today, are we, violence?”did i mention that we get a training scene? but like a really hot, full of tension, angsty, fighting scene. she attacks him, he catches her fist, she tries again, he pulls her back against his chest, she jumps him, he pins her down. i could go on and on and on, believe me, it was really freaking hot.we even get a “let-me-see-your-injuries“ scene and if you thought the fighting scene was impeccable, then you have to read about this one. jaw? on the floor 💗💞🩷💕💘”there is no me without you.”—dain, what a hypocrite. you know who this ass reminds me of? adam kent and freaking gale hawthorne. i get that he wants to protect violet but he’s holding her back unlike xaden who wants her to unravel and become stronger. speaking of that, they remind me so much of warnette in that matter. i’m not done, they’re even torydarius coded. i loved seeing their relationship develop in a long time span. days pass, weeks pass, months pass. it’s not like they were enemies and then suddenly a week later they decided to like each other, nope, it definitely took them weeks to even admit their connection. they might be enemies to the core but who doesn’t love a good old enemies to lovers?alsojackreminded me so much of cato hadley from the hunger games. i know he’s evil and all that but every books needs a cato. and he got we deserved soooPLS I NEED THE NEXT BOOK AS OF NOW 💥💥",5
11,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","3.5 🌟OK SO I GOT PLAYED A LITTLE!!!!THE GOODThis was a HIGHLY enjoyable book. I had so much uni work to do, but I still flew through it. The author wasted no time – she made a fast-paced, action-packed, well established fantasy world. I love how we got introduced to bits and aspects of this world slowly, she really KNEW how to world build, how to ease us into this complicated setting. AT EVERY POINT OF THIS BOOK I knew what was going on, who I was rooting for, what are the aims of the particular scene. And you, my fellow fantasy readers, know how that doesn’t always happen. Like I said in the updates, EVERY SINGLE PAGE WAS A PLOT POINT and no fill-ins. I hate it when writers drag the story, you can really tell when they do that, and fantasy authors are for some reason prone to doing that. This wasn’t such a book. It’s not that long (around 400 pages) and I wasn’t bored in any scene. I love how the story intensified towards the end, but the stakes were high throughout the WHOLE THING.THAT Xaden CHAPTER ATEATEATEATE, I LOVED IT SO MUCH!AND THAT PLOT TWIST IT ENDED ON, I COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING! UGH, I can’t wait for the next book.THE BADI said it before, WILL SAY IT AGAIN, this is the most formulaic book I’ve read in my life. You know when popular musicians make songs SPECIFICALLY so they can become popular on TikTok and you SOMEHOW ALWAYS KNOW. Yes, this was that, but for books. You can really tell the author used EVERY SINGLE TROPE she knows people love and will eat up and put it in her book (enemies to lovers, mated pairs, the whole rebellion trope, I’m the chosen one but I don’t want to be that blablabla), I just couldn’t get past that fact. Before reading this book I saw a few posts saying how this book is similar to ACOTAR. When I just started it, I didn’t really see the resemblance, but THEN I GOT IT. Dain is SOOOO Tamlin coded, Xaden is basically Rhysand, again the rebellion thing, THE MATES THING (god I hate that so much). I wouldn’t call this a carbon copy of ACOTAR, but you can’t tell me it wasn’t loosely inspired by it (for the sole purpose of satisfying booktok).This was in no way original, and that’s the number one thing I didn’t like about this book. There wasn’t a single thing happening, a plot point, a scene, a character trait, that I haven’t seen before. This plays into this being EXTREMELY FORMULAIC.For those who read it, is it just me? (I know it isn’t)THE DRAGONS WERE SO FUNNY. I’m sorry, I didn’t like the dragons. I liked them individually (as almost characters) BUT they WERE IN NO WAY WELL WRITTEN. They’re supposed to be these mysterious, dangerous, sacred creatures, but Violet’s dragon says the word FUCK at one point. I LAUGHED SO MUCH, HAD ME ON THE FLOOR.THE CHARACTERSUgh, they’re supposed to be adults, but they’re SO YA CODED. You can’t tell me Violet is 20.Surprisingly, I liked the protagonists, but individually. They’re both flawed, but also with a sense of moral, a great combination of characteristics. However, them as a couple, not really. The banter was there in the beginning but then it just evaporated. They went from being enemies to LOVERS THE PLANET HASN’T SEEN so quickly. They were enemies for a good chunk of pages, I must admit that, but the change was in no way gradual (pls go to the Mariana Zapata slow burn school k thanks).(And also, Violet was so desperate with the L word, GIRLIE STAND UP!!!)The spice was good ngl (had me kicking my feet lol)I LOVED THE SIDE CHARACTERS. RHIANNON AND LIAM (sorrows sorrows prayers) HAVE MY HEART.FINAL THOUGHTSThis was a fast-paced, highly enjoyable first book in the series I will for sure continue reading when the next installment is out. It wasn’t very memorable and won’t make the FAVORITES list, but I still had fun reading. I’m leaving room for improvement.Is it overhyped, tell me in the comments??? (let’s have a respectful discussion)💕💕",3
12,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","if y’all see me on the news tomorrow it’s because i broke into this author’s house and tried to steal the manuscript for the sequel…i can’t even begin to describe the attachment and love i have for this book and its characters. it’s one of my favorite books of all time now. the author really wrote the most heart wrenching, emotionally loaded, appetite terminating sentences and said “deal with it.”to put into few words: this new adult fantasy romance book is set at a war college, there’s dragons, and there’s 2 main opposing sides that hate one another. our fmc belonging to one and our mmc belonging to the other. i think you can see where this is going…WRONG because you could have 30 guns pointing at my head and i still wouldn’t have predicted THAT last sentence. all my brain matter would cover the wall behind me.Violet aka Violence (iykyk) is my favorite character all around. she’s just like me for real. the way she thinks and talks. she’s really a girls girl. i usually prefer dual pov but not in this case. being in her head made me realize i’ve never had an original thought. she’s a fmc written by a woman to its core. she strong, resilient, a fucking genius, badass, witty af, compassionate, and so damn attractive…god idk if i wanna be her or be with her… everything she goes through and overcomes made me shed a tear or 7. she’s unpredictable and that’s what i love about her.Xaden…i’ve never read a man described so damn sexy. i was in heat and prepared to do a line off this man’s stomach…his middle name is basically “self control” and the way that crumbles from just the mere existence of Violet. he says it best when “i’m annoyingly aware of everything you do…”i appreciated how he has a personality outside of the slow (and i mean slow) burn romance. he’s protective but not overbearing. he’s idealistic and charming without even trying. he “hates” her but literally had daggers made for her specific body shape and fit. he had a saddle made for her body type so she doesn’t fall off her dragon. he’s so thoughtful and attentive, it comes natural to him like breathing. the longing that’s in his eyes when he simply glances at violet (you’d think he’d be plotting her death from an outsider looking in) was written like poetry. Violet has him so tightly wrapped around her finger and they can’t even begin to understand the depths of it…one would think the romance would be my hyper fixation for this book but it’s not even that (not only that.) it’s the fucking dragons! the way they are described, have personalities of their own, the way they always check and roast Violet had me LOLing and giddy. the bonds they have with their riders felt as real as oxygen in the air! 😮‍💨some quotes that aren’t spoilery but still had me barking like a dog in heat:👹“heat rushes through every vein, wakes every nerve ending. I hate the reaction of my body to the site of him, but I can’t deny it. His appeal is so fucking inconvenient.” she is so me coded“i know how to handle a corset” and he does“There’s a palpable energy in every room, he enters, and brushes over my skin, like a caress each time our eyes meet. Even now, I’m aware of every breath he takes, as he sits next to me midway down the table.”“fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.” god he’s so miserable 😩the MCs and dragons dynamic is so uniquely and well written like nothing else i’ve read. it’s so ying and yang coded. this book, in short, is a limb to me. cut it off, i bleed out and die! it is diverse, rich, deep, magnificently written, and every fiber of me loves it (i say all of this referring to a piece of media that ruined my life🥲)",5
13,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","Did not finish.I’d like to know if I’m actually reading the same book as everyone else. This is the worst piece of literature I’ve read in a long while. I got to chapter 8. Couldn’t go any further.First off, the endless use of the F bomb is tacky and lazy if you ask me. So many great descriptive words and all this author can do is spout curse words. Curse words do not a personality make. Neither is being a horny 13 year old. Violet is supposed to be 20 years old, but it seems more like she is 12. I mean…“the scar that marks his eye brow only makes him hotter. Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-in-trouble-and-you-like-it-level-hot…”Who talks like that? I’ll tell you. Tweens.I think I’m rooting for the other side of this conflict too. What kind of battle strategy is it to encourage the deaths of dozens of people as an entrance exam? Then to be okay with it when your cadets at killing each other. Let’s just kill off a huge percentage of our able bodied young men and woman every year. Yup. Sound strategy. The big bad school is so scary! It’s incredibly cliche, predictable, and trite in all the worst ways.Violets only personality trait is that she’s SuPeR FaSt aNd SmArT. And the reason her mother tossed her into the school in the first place is super unbelievable. It’s just a weak book with weak and convenient reasons to push the plot forward.",1
14,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","i hate to admit it, but the hype is real. i wasnt sure i could trust all of the praise this book is getting because i didnt like the last RY book that was widely loved. but this one is enjoyable!it has all of your typical fantasy tropes - a girl who doesnt know her powerful potential, found families, a magical enemy threatening the kingdom, and enemies to lovers. so nothing about this is super unique. but everything is done really well and is very engaging.this is just one of those books that is a lot of fun to read. so you dont really care about how well its written or the bigger points reviewers usually critique. its just about pure enjoyment.so if you like dragons and youre looking for a new fantasy read with a decent amount of romance, this is the one for you!↠4.5 stars",4
15,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","Omg this book. this book. this book. As soon as I finished the book I immediately started rereading all of my favorite scenes/chapters which is how I know I'm obsessed. First of all, the setting and concept is so cool. The book takes place at a war college for dragon riders. It gives slight Hogwarts/Harry Potter vibes but 100x more brutal and deadly. I also loved the politics and backstory of the outside world as well.And then we have the romance!!! Rebecca Yarros, I bow down to you for writing Xadan Riorson. That man 🥵🥵 The way you never know if he wants to kiss Violet or kill her. The way he's so mysterious and guarded but also has these surprising and small moments of kindness and loyalty. Instantly one of my top book boyfriends.November can't come soon enough. I need book 2 asap",5

24,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","☆⋅⋆ ──1st read 2023 (may): 5 stars☆⋅⋆ ───2nd read 2023 (nov):5 starsSONG:The Great War – Taylor SwiftA dragon without its rider is a tragedy.A rider without their dragon is dead.how did I miss the feeling of reading such a good book that I couldn’t wait to run to my notes app once I finished the book and write down a thesis dedicated to how awesome the book is. This is the best book that came out this year. THANK YOU FOURTH WING AND REBECCA FOR CURING MY READING AND REVIEWING SLUMP! 🙏first of all while there are a lot of reason why I absolutely adored this book, I gave this book 5 stars, because while reading Fourth Wing I was reminded againwhyI love reading. While I still enjoyed reading in the last 2 years, most of the books I’ve read just felt so average and boring. Every plot, every character written, every love story felt predictable like I’ve read it a million times already. Reading Fourth Wing on the other hand felt refreshing and unique. I was on the edge of my seat every chapter wanting to know what would happen next and every time something great happened it made me giddy as hell like I’m 13 again reading Twilight/The Hunger Games in the middle of night just immersing myself in a new world. The stakes are fucking high in this book and no characters is safe. The two main characters are safe due to plot amor, but everyone else? Fuck around and find out. 🌚let’s start with a couple of selling points why everyone on planet earth and beyond HAS to give this book at least a try:➟ this book is set in aWAR COLLEGE. What does that mean? Imagine Harry Potter meets Zodiac Academy, but deadlier. Navarre is in a conflict with another country (don’t ask me to name it, the names in this books are insane but not in a good way 😭 I can’t remember shit) so because of the war that is going on, the student at Basgiath War College learn battle strategies, train for battle etc. and students die all the times there.➟DRAGONS AND DRAGONRIDERS!I was always lowkey obsessed with books or shows that have dragons in it, but this book solified my obsession. Dragons actually can choose their riders and have magic how cool is that?! Once a dragon and a rider bonds, the rider can channel the dragon’s magic and it comes in all kind of forms. Someone could wield water, wind. Someone else can read memories through touching, Someone else can move objects. It’s fucking fantastic.➟GREAT WORLD BUILDING. Besides the magic and dragons and all that which is amazing. The whole world of this universe is so interesting. The names and places in this world are complicated af, but the world building was explained great imo. Instead of a big info dumping we get the information easily through dialogues. I also thought it was quite endearing see Violet reciterandomhistory about Navarre when she is under stressful situation to calm herself down.The 4 Quadrant groups at Basgiath War College are:✎Riders Quadrant: the dragon riders and the ones that protect the country and fight against the enemies. They also have the best reputation in Naverre, because of how badass they are.✎Healers Quadrant: are people who are the doctors and tend to all kind of injuries. There are also menders who are very rare who can mend broken bones quickly.✎Scribe Quadrant: the academics and scholars of Navarre.. basically the brainiacs who know all about the history and all wars etc.✎Infantry Quadrant: i’m honestly don’t know what they do.. i guess they are trained as soldier? idk really because we barely get informations about them and what they do..➟SLOWBURN ENEMIES TO LOVERS ROMANCE. Violet and Xander are real enemies, since Violet’s mother killed Xanden’s father, but Xanderns father killed Violet’s brother!! so there is a lot of delicious tensions between them for a good reason. It takes them a while to open up, but when they do it’s explosive 🔥 so don’t worry there is smut and it’s very explicit you just have to be a little patient.➟CHARACTERS ON POINT. The whole cast of this book is interesting. Not one single boring character in sight. Even the villains or bad characters in this book have a spark to them that will make you want to know more. Also all the relationship, friendship and alliances forged are great.➟ a veryFAST PACED PLOTthat will keep you on your toes. So much happens in this book I wouldn’t even know where to start summarizing it.➟DRAGONS.. i can’t mentioned this enough. These dragons are ruthless and cunning and so badass I can’t stop talking about them. All of the dragons have their own personality. If you love House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones! This book is for you besties. ✨🗡️VIOLET SORRENGAIL(h) 🗡️“I’m not going to die today.”don’t we all root for the underdog and want to see them win?even tho I don’t think a perfect heroine exist, Violet makes an almost perfect fantasy heroine. She is the newest addition to my all time fav heroines that’s how awesome she is. 💅All her life she has been called weak and fragile due to ther size. She was trained to be a Scribe, but because her mother is an infamous Rider and doesn’t allowed for anything else beside being a Rider and boy dideveryoneunderestimate Violet. It was so easy to root for Violet, because she never had it easy or choose the easy way out. What I always hate about fantasy heroine is that they are the chosen one and are always special in some kind of way or kickass from the beginning and that’s not Violet. She might fall into the chosen one/special trope, but she literally had to claw and fight her way to the top. Violet doesn’t have raw physical power, so every obsticle and challenged she had to use her wit, intelligence, will and sheer determination. Violet’s most powerful organ is her brain.Another trait that I admire about Violet is her ✨compassion✨. The world, and especially Basgiath War College, is as cutthroat and ruthless as it can be. I fell in love with Violet the moment she decided to help a girl cross the parapet by asking her to switch one shoe with her since the other girl’s (Rhiannon) shoes were not made to cross that parapet, and she would have easily slipped and fallen to her death. Violet could have easily ignored that and let the competition take themselves out while making her climb simultaneously easier by having two good shoes, but that’s not how Violet is. How could I not root for her every step of the way? Impossible. My badass softie. 🥺🔹XANDEN RIORSON(H) 🔹tall, broody, dark and handsome he embodies every typical fantasy hero to a T but who fucking cares it works, why change a running system?Xanden is so hot. The most powerful wing leader at the college? Hell yes sign me up! The way he doesn’t care about rules and what everyone expects of him 🛐 but the hottest thing about Xanden is that he always believed in Violet’s potential. While everyone else around Violet always tries to baby her and protect her from harm, Xanden challenges her to be better and get stronger. I can also not forget what a comedian Xanden could be with his sarcasm.. it took me out sometimes because I didn’t see it coming lmao.“Have you always been this tall?” I blurt the first thing that comes to mind.”No. I was a child at some point.”Xanden is tough on the outside and seems more broody than he already is, cause inside he is a lowkey softie. For the people he cares about he is loyal and would do anything for them and his friends would do anything for him as well. The loyalty is mutual. The found family y’all. 🥺👉👈Since the book is written solely from Violet’s POV there is so much about Xanden that intrigues me. He is still pretty much a mystery. There is so much about his past .. I’m looking at him and his mother’s relationship ��� that needs to be uncovered. I want to know more about his relationship with his father as well since his father is the Great Betrayer who tried to rebel against Navarre’s king. There is so much potential to his backstory in book 2 and I can’t wait to find out more.🐉TAIRN & ANDARNA (DRAGONS)🐉“Violet Sorrengail ,” she says as she writes in the Book of Riders. “Nice to see that you made it.” She offers me a quick, shaky smile. “For the record, please tell me the name of the dragon who chose you.” I lift my chin. “Tairneanach.”“Pronunciation could use some work.” Tairn’s voice rumbles through my head.“Hey, at least I remembered ,” I think back in his general direction, wondering if he’ll hear me across the field.“At least I didn’t let you fall to your death.” He sounds utterly bored, but he definitely heard me.My grumpy old dragon Tairn and my sunshine princess Andarna baby. 🥺😩 I have no words great enough to describe my love for these two dragons.This big ass dragon bonding with this tiny human being will never cease to amaze me. You know we all love the grumpy hero, but give the heroine a grumpy dragon and that relatonship HITS DIFFERENT. Tairn and Violet’s relatonship is so funny .. all their banters had me grinning like a little kid it was so fun. 🖤🧚THE ROMANCE🧚“Am I affecting your schedule, Violence?” There’s a definite smirk on those lips. “I just need to know what my chances are here.” My hands curl into fists. The ass has the nerve to smile.“That’s the oddest way I’ve ever been hit on—”“Not my chances with you, you conceited prick!”from enemies to reluctant partners to lovers? Their development was so on point without being toxic. Both of them hated with hate for each other for valid reasons, but it never got toxic between them like a lot of real enemies to lovers in fantasy do.He nips at my skin. “I’m not sweet. Please don’t mistake any part of me for soft or kind. That will only get you hurt, and whatever you do…” He buries his face in my neck, inhaling deeply. “Don’t fall for me.”Violetxander are the new standard for the “she fell first, but he fell harder” trope. Violet with her compassion can’t help but see the good in people, while it’s really hard for Xander to let anyone in let alone his mortal enemy. But his actions speak louder than his words. All the times he silently watches Violet, helped her, challenged her, trained her >>> I know he is obsessed with Violet even tho he is reluctant to admit his feelings for her.👫SIDE CHARACTERS👫“What did you want to be when you grew up?” I ask, just to keep the conversation going.”Alive.” He shrugs.Liam, Rhiannon, Imogen, Garrick and the rest. I love them all with and without their flaws.. some of them needed longer to grow and me then others, but eventually they all got me. They feel like family. 🙏I’d tell you to not get attached to them cause you don’t really now if they are making it until the end of the series or not, but honestly it’s not possible to not get attached to any of them. I’ll just be crying quietly in my corner when one of them eventually ends up dead bc of war and all. 😭👯‍♀️VIOLET & MIRA👯‍♀️“Don’t die, Violet. I’d hate to be an only child.” She grins and walks away, sauntering past the line of gawking candidates as word spreads of exactly who she is and what she’s done.Mira the older protective sister who Violet had to live in the shadow all these years. While there weren’t that many scenes with Violet and Mira together.. I adored their scenes.💥THE DEPICTION OF WAR💥One thing I liked a lot about Fourth Wing is how war is portrayed in this book. It might sound weird that I liked that a lot of people died in this book, but I thought that’s just realistic when it comes to war. Even the most efficient fighters in this book die not because they can’t protect themselves or fail in some kind of way, but some just do because they tried protecting their friends and some things don’t go their way. I never knew what would happen next and that was ✨ thrilling ✨.Nothing is black and white as it seems and to see that realization from Violet slowly throughout the book was so interesting. She started the book firmly believing in one side (her mother being a war hero and all that) and to see her journey by the end of this book is quite fascinating. In war it always takes at least two to tango and neither side are 100% right or wrong..it’s just a matter of perspective.CONCLUSIONFor people who know me or have been following my reviews for some time, they know I’m the stingiest of reader and find fault in everything and get bored easily 😭 but this book got me hooked from the beginning and it only got better with each chapter. Was everything perfect no? I could always nitpick on some things, but as a whole? Fourth Wing is a fantasy masterpiece. The pace, the characters, the plot, the romance, did I mention THE DRAGONS??? *chef’s kiss*I’d like to add that the book ends on a cliffhanger, but it’s a “wow I can’t wait what will happen next” cliffhanger so it’s a good kind of cliffhanger not one where you want to flush the book down the nearest toilet. 😌 but anyways WAKE ME UP WHEN IT’S NOVEMBER 7th!!┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑THE EMPYREAN SERIES#1Fourth Wing– 5 stars#2 Iron Flame – tbr┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙",5
25,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","""Decide, Violet. Are you going to die a scribe? Or live as a rider?""Oh, this is good. I see now why y'all love it so much.IfFourth Wingwere a drug, I'd be an addict. It grabbed me so thoroughly from the very first moment and refused to let go. I was fully immersed, I didn't want to sleep, didn't want to eat. I just wanted to inhale it as fast as I could. And honestly, isn't this why we read, for this exact feeling?The action begins right on the first page and never lets up. There was no onerous worldbuilding, no endless backgrounds or introductions. We just seamlessly slip into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. Every time I get the itch to read fantasy, the one thing that holds me back is how much worldbuilding I would have to endure just to get to the good parts. But no such issues here. The good parts start right at the beginning.Is this the most original story? No. Is this the most well written? Also no. (Don't kill me for saying that, all you rabid fans.) In fact, the dialogue has me cringing at times, with its penchant for f-bombs as emphasis and its often basic but slightly pompous back-and-forth that only teenagers can pull off. I guess in that way, it is true to its characters since they're all not much older than teenagers.But slight criticisms aside, this story is executed to perfection. It takes several well-trodden tropes and not only cohesively blends them together, but also manages to squeeze every ounce of entertainment out of them along the way. And I'm not above being entertained.This is my first real foray into the romantasy genre that's got everyone aflutter. And I can see the appeal. Fantasy is a bit of an adrenaline rush and so is romance, so blending the two together is really the perfect symbiosis. Of course you'd want your hero to fight hard in a war between good and evil. And it totally makes sense that they would love hard too if they could die any day. And if the object of desire is one's enemy instead of one's friend? Even better.I'm a little late to theFourth Wingparty, and there's good reason. I was certain this was a duology (don't ask me why I thought this), so I figured if I just held off a little bit, I could bam my way through both books without having to stop and deal with the inevitable anguish of waiting for the next book. Well, the joke's on me because this is actually a five-parter. So lots of waiting will be had by me. As a consolation, at least I can dive straight intoIron Flame.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#2.Iron Flame~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧",4
26,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)","This is kinda harsh but my honest opinion after reading the ARC ~** May 2023 edit: I'm a bookseller and read a variety of genres including children's and YA. My issues are not with these genres. My issues are with books that read as clumsy, horny (and not in a fun camp way), and unpolished. Which in my Personal Opinion(tm)!!!!!!!!!! this book is.It's pretty stock standard commercial horny hetero fiction. That's fine. Can't please everyone. I'll be totally honest: if you don't care that much about quality of writing and want an easy het romance-fantasy novel à la Cassandra Clare et al. (nothing wrong with that!), you may enjoy this. It's not my thing, though, and I can't recommend it if you want a decent wholemeal fantasy novel to sink your teeth into. **I found this disappointing and I’m frankly shocked it has such glowing early reviews.To be fair, my disappointment is partly caused by the misleading blurb and ARC marketing. The blurb implies a high stakes military fantasy set at a war college for dragon riders; this put me in mind of Temeraire, The Poppy War, or even elements of The Hunger Games. Romance is mentioned - “traitors will become allies… or lovers” - but it’s certainly not implied to be wholly a romance novel.I saw on the author’s instagram that this is being marketed as a “new adult fantasy” - if 'new adult' just means ‘lacking the sophistication of genre fiction but can’t be marketed as YA romance because of sex scenes’… then, sure, call it 'new adult'.All the characters - even supposed high-ranking military figures - speak like millennials from the year 2023. Why was the word ‘vibe’ used so many times? As in, ‘his vibe is weird’. But in other ways the setting recalls medieval Europe? Who edited this???I would not have picked this up if the marketing more accurately reflected the content. It’s 100% a romance novel in the vein of Cassandra Claire, Sarah J. Maas, the Divergent series; any genuine stakes are basically subplot to the central romance. The oh-so-important ~tension~ could be resolved by just… talking to one another? Most other world building elements are underdeveloped & confusing, full of plot holes, and everyone’s dialogue is set up to give the protagonist & ~dark~ love interest perfect Marvel-esque quips and one-liners. I get that this is a popular thing but to me it lacks sophistication and polish of contemporary fantasy :-)Also, my certified transgender opinion (tm) is that the inclusion of a random nonbinary side character was disingenuous and definitely tokenism, lol.The reason for two stars instead of one is because I found the representation of the protagonist's disability - and how it was navigated in such physically demanding settings - genuinely interesting.All in all, this, to me, read like a semi-edited fanfic. If that’s your thing, go buckwild. Otherwise, I can’t really recommend it. The blurb is pretty misleading, imo. Expect a YA romance novel.",1
27,"Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)",i’m not emotionally stable enough to wait until november for the next book,5
28,Lessons in Chemistry,"1.5 starsThe synopsis describes this book as “laugh out loud funny”, recommended for fans of Where’d You Go Bernadette and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.A female chemist in the ‘50s? Great! Count me in.BUT….I obviously read a different book.- this book should be shelved in the fantasy section. Seriously. It’s fantasy. Which is fine, but if I had known I would have skipped it. The switch between fantastical elements and serious ones gave me whiplash.- Funny? Within a few pages a woman is called a c*** twice, a brutal rape is described in detail, and there’s a suicide due to homophobia. Yeah, just hilarious.- I’m over quirky characters who behave as if they are on the spectrum. Why can’t we have a woman who is a brilliant chemist but isn’t naive, socially awkward, and clueless? Except when she’s not, usually in time to deliver another monologue.- the MC’s daughter is a genius who knew the periodic table as a preschooler and reads the Sound and the Fury at age 8. Of course she is. Very relatable.- Elizabeth’s views and actions were not consistent with the era. It’s as if a woman from 2022 time traveled back to the 1950s and then lectured everyone with lengthy monologues on social issues and women’s rights. I don’t need a lecture and I don’t need to be repeatedly hit over the head on relevant social issues. This book needed more showing, less telling.- the message is a worthy one. A woman ahead of her time in STEM who must fight the status quo in a male dominated world. But I think the message would have been stronger and more authentic if it had been realistic. There’s a lot of exaggeration and preposterous situations to drive a point home, which is not my favorite storytelling technique.- all the men, with one exception, were ugly and hateful misogynists. I’m weary of male-bashing in fiction.- Did I need to read details of a man who masturbates and flings pubic hairs across the room, leaving behind his sticky porn magazines for his wife to clean up? No I did not 🤮- Atheism vs Faith. The author mentions multiple times that this is a free country and we have a right to our beliefs. I 100% agree. But she apparently believes only atheists have a right to their beliefs. I’m no bible thumping extremist, but it’s offensive when religion and people of faith are portrayed only in derogatory terms, such as faith is “a simpleton’s recipe for prayers and beads” and a funeral service was “boring verse and preposterous prayers”. A minister muses that the problem with his job “was how many times he had to lie”. The ministers and priests were all child abusers, liars, and greedy crooks. Lay people of faith were all violent protestors and/or morons. The message repeatedly driven home throughout the book, ad nauseam? Atheism = good People of faith = bad.Believe me, if the author had portrayed atheists as all bad I would find it equally as offensive.Why is intolerance of beliefs/religion the last acceptable prejudice?- I’m weary of the argument of science vs religion. Sure there are extremists who deny science but the majority of people and religions do not believe they are mutually exclusive. There are plenty of religious scientists. Sigh….- Anachronisms. Subsidized child care in Sweden wasn’t enacted until 1975, although the MC refers to it in 1960. And was defunding the police a thing in the early 1950s? I think not.- certainly women have been, and are, discriminated against. I’m not denying that bias occurs but the exaggeration and preposterous events in the story hinders the message. I have a science degree. I took many college courses in STEM. I worked in a male dominated work culture. In this book every single man in a power position was a misogynist. Not realistic. Please stop it..- Also, we are given information at the end that suggests there was a valid reason Elizabeth wasn’t accepted in the doctoral program, that had nothing to do with her gender or an incident that happened early in the book. This confused me?! What was the message? 🤷🏻‍♀️No book is without merit. The positives:- I am not usually a fan of anthropomorphism but I loved the dog, Six-Thirty. By far he was my favorite character. And yay, he survives! 😍- the cooking show was cute* this was a buddy read with Marialyce and another book to throw on top of the 2022 disappointing reads category.* I received a digital copy for review via NetGalley. All opinions are my own",2
29,Lessons in Chemistry,"I gave all of my votes to this book, both for the best debut and historical fiction categories, at the Goodreads Choice Awards. I'm thrilled to find out that Barnes & Noble has chosen this brilliant work as the book of the year - it is highly deserved!Amazing news, my friends! This fantastic book has been adapted into a streaming series on Apple TV, starring Brie Larson as Elizabeth Zott and an outstanding cast crew including Lewis Pullman, Beau Bridges, Ana Naomi King, Kevin Sussman, Thomas Mann, Stephanie Koenig, and Patrick Walker. I cannot wait to binge-watch it!Okay, folks, I just finished the best book of 2022! Now I can relax knowing that I don't need to search for something better. No, wait, I lied. Not about finding the best book - this one is freaking amazing - but I will continue to search for exemplary fictions like this that can speak to my heart and soul at the same time! I give it five gazillion stars!I loved the author's extra-intelligent, dark, original sense of humor, and I fell in love with her characters. The story of Elizabeth brought out so many complex feelings: I laughed, I got angry, I cried, I sighed, I laughed again, and as soon as I finished the last chapter, I gave my ovation! This is an underrated secret gem! Don't you dare skip this book or let it sit in your TBR pile. Just read it!Let me give you a summary of the plot and introduce you to the characters:Elizabeth Zott: How can I express my feelings about this character? She's so unique, different, extraordinary, visionary, extremely quirky, odd, straightforward, honest, a real feminist, intelligent, intellectual, fighter, survivor, and a brilliant scientist who is brave enough to fight for her rights and her loved ones against mansplaining, inequality, abuse, and humiliation!In 1960, after her traumatic experience at UCLA, she starts working at the Hastings Research Institute, which is administered with a male workforce that ignores her enthusiasm and hard work. Only one person sees her and shows respect for her accomplishments: an aspiring, Nobel Prize-nominated, grudge-holder named Calvin Evans.The first time they met, he thought she was a secretary, and the second time they met, he vomited on her. There is nothing ordinary about their love story. They are soul mates. They are great minds alike. They are the quirkiest, most unconventional couple. They row together. They adopt the ugliest and most loyal, incredible dog and name him Six-Thirty. They were happy, even though Elizabeth rejected marrying him because she wanted to become an independent scientist without being acknowledged for her husband's contributions.But then...We fast-forward to see Elizabeth building a new life, raising her four-year-old, extra-smart, one-of-a-kind, sweetest girl named Mad Zott, helping their dog Six-Thirty improve his vocabulary skills, and most importantly, she's a TV star now! She teaches women to use chemistry not only in their kitchen but in their entire life to embrace change and challenges. She hosts the most eccentric cooking show called ""Supper at Six.""Her blunt and honest comments about marriage, religion, and society's norms will be considered rebellious and unconventional.Elizabeth is not alone. She has a 55-year-old, devoted neighbor named Harriet Sloane, who truly detests her husband. She has her supporting producer, Walter Pine, who believed in her enough to give her a chance on TV while raising his daughter by himself. Dr. Mason likes to row with her, stopping by to wash her dishes and check her out.But Mad thinks her mother is unhappy, and her homework to create a family tree pushes her to search for more information about her father's past. She has no idea that her search will uncover many long-kept secrets.Overall, this is the best book I have read lately! I fell in love with everything about this story and highly, extremely, and absolutely recommend it.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
30,Lessons in Chemistry,"This book is mind-numbingly bad. I really do not see what everybody writing rave reviews are seeing. So, I'm a chemist and this main character is exactly the type of chemist that we make fun of - a pretentious snob that non-ironically calls household items by their scientific name and inserts their scientific knowledge into any conversation they have to assert how intelligent they are. There's a part where she criticizes a can of soup for having 'chemicals' in it, even though a chemist should know all food that exists is made of chemicals - that is literally how the world works, so on top of being an arrogant snot she is also an incorrect arrogant snot on multiple occasions.Another point I'd like to bring up as a chemist, Elizabeth Zott apparently has several PhDs worth of knowledge, on degrees that she didn't even do. Her passion apparently is abiogenesis, to which actual scientists dedicate their entire academic careers solely, yet she also knows food science (an entirely different course of study) and can also teach herself how to row solely by reading physics textbooks (another entirely different course of study). It must be where her ridiculous daughter got her ridiculous genes from - she enthusiastically reads Norman Mailer and Vladimir Nabokov at age 4. I mean, didn't we all? She also debates religion with a reverend, who converts to atheism. Again, relatable pre-school experiences we all experienced.I'm also fairly sick of women putting down other women in all aspects of life, and this is no exception. Almost every other woman in this story is presented as catty, conniving and simple-minded (because they all believe in God, which this book hammers in that only total airheads do) except for our main character because she's not like the other girls. She wears pants and talks about how Sweden has subsidized childcare (which didn't even exist in 1960 yet so I guess the author phoned in on the whole research aspect). There is also no mention of any characters of color in this story, but that doesn't stop the author from comparing being a housewife to SLAVERY and including the daughter reading about the Congo cannibals to other-ize people of African descent. Bear in mind, that this is marketed as a comedy book. So ha ha. Every male character is also a chauvinistic pig with no redeeming qualities, also always hysterical.I didn't even touch on the most offensive part of this novel. TW: the beginning features a graphic r*pe scene, so good thing they didn't bother including a content warning. 'A novel that sparks joy on every page' claims the dust jacket, I claim bullsh*t.In summary, there are no redeeming qualities about this book, except maybe that there was a dog in it.",1
31,Lessons in Chemistry,"Imagine if all men took women seriously . . .When you come across that perfect read, at what point do you realize? For me, it was from the very first page ofLessons in Chemistry.Honestly, who does Bonnie Garmus think she is, coming in here and writing a book that completely speaks to me? And on top of that, it's her debut. Well, just knock me over with a feather too while you're at it, why don't you!Elizabeth Zott is a chemist in the 1960s. The problem is, she is the only one who views herself that way. Her male colleagues cannot get past the fact that she's a woman, and treat her more as a secretary and doormat, acknowledging her only long enough to steal her work. That is, until Calvin Evans, another brilliant chemist, comes along and really sees all that she is capable of. But life is unexpected, and so a few years later, Elizabeth is somehow the host of a cooking show. But in her heart, she still desires to be truly seen as a chemist.You guys know how much I love strong female characters, and Elizabeth Zott is all that and more. She's fearless in the face of adversity, she stays true to herself, and she never lets others intimidate her into being less than all she can be. In other words, she is my hero.It's not just Elizabeth who warms my heart. This story has the most wonderful collection of supporting characters. They add so much color and spirit to the whole thing. I wanted to hug them all. And if you're an animal lover of any sort, just be ready to have your heart burst into a million ooey gooey pieces. In fact, Six-Thirty might just be my favorite literary dog of all time.The writing is so witty and brilliant. There's a zing to it that makes it feel zippy and wholly original. I couldn't stop laughing and I couldn't put it down. Usually I can't wait to reach the end of a book so I can check it off my long TBR and move onto the next. But I wanted this to go and go and never end. I tried to savor every moment, but I ended up devouring it.What an absolute delight this was, from the very first moment to the last. It possesses all the hallmarks of the very best stories. It made me laugh, feel, think, and wonder. It filled me with joy and buoyed my spirits. It gave me everything I wanted and everything I didn't even know to ask for.So many books come and go that often a true gem ends up buried in the deluge. Please don't let this one pass you by. Go read it. You'll be glad you did.",5
32,Lessons in Chemistry,"After seeing endless 5 star reviews of “Lessons in Chemistry, a book I hadn’t considered reading….— I thought- “Well, Wow…..it must be extraordinary—some secret I should find out?/!”My enjoyment value was simply ‘so-so’. I didn’t come away with the enthusiasm for this book like many other readers did.In my own life in ‘California’ - during the 50’s, 60’s….I was a Kinesiology major at UC Berkeley.I never felt like I was in a man’s world. My organic chemistry classes were grueling- but that wasn’t because I was a woman.In my experience— I never had a problem. I wasn’t sexually harassed — nobody put their hand up my skirt unless I wanted them to . I was never patted on the head or belittle for being less than.There was something ‘off-putting’ to me about this book —The protagonist -Elizabeth Zott - was as equally fatuous as intelligent.I found the dialogue often condescending….with overly exaggerated themes.The theme ‘righteous indignation’ stood out for me more than ‘authentic equality’.Plus…..the humor lost me completely.The science descriptions felt more ‘for show’ — an indulgent plot device to produce proof ofhigh levels of dopamine chemicals in the areas of love.I prefer what George Burns’ had to say about love:“Love is something like a backache, it doesn’t show up on any x-ray, but you know it’s there”.I wasn’t a champion for Elizabeth Zott,The emphasis of her being ahead of her day; a strong woman; or a groundbreaking woman felt false-hearted.Her bogus disposition was too fabricated for my taste.Most of the characters had that caricature type feeling; unscrupulous.Basically — the story wasn’t “zippy, zesty, or zotty” entertaining to me at all.Although I was overall underwhelmed, I did enjoy the authors notes - (my absolute favorite part) - she almost sold me on how groundbreaking her book was.Her enthusiasm had a contagious magnetism about her. I appreciated her passion for her excitement in writing this book —Congrats to Bonnie Garmus….she has a large audience who applaud her work sincerely.So —please don’t pass on this book - on my accounts -it just wasn’t my cuppa tea.Average, lukewarm, to indifferent.2.5 - rating up.",3
33,Lessons in Chemistry,"Sorry, but I don't get the hype.I found this mostly boring, to be honest. The book zips from really dark subjects like rape and abuse to light somewhat farcical subjects like teaching a dog English or Elizabeth becoming an amazing rower by studying physics (women can smart their way into being better than six foot athletic men at everything because saying they can't is sexist, yo)... and I struggled to find any of it compelling.Elizabeth was difficult to warm to --not because of her abrasive personality-- because she felt like a mouthpiece for 21st Century feminist monologues. This is supposed to be the 1950s? I just didn't buy it. All her rants are straight out of a modern day Smash the Patriarchy podcast.And it deserves a further eye roll for the fact that because she is all into science and logic and whatever, this means Elizabeth is also cold, robotic and devoid of emotion. Cos we all know you can't be a scientist AND have feelings. Maybe the author worried if she showed emotion we'd find her toowomanly.I don't know what else to say. The reviews called it ""hilarious"", which I did not think it was. And also ""adorable"" which... what? On page rape, death, abuse, suicide and sexism... super cute.The book does sort of lighten up as it progresses, but it did not get any less boring.",2
34,Lessons in Chemistry,"I could've saved time and read a laundry list of cliches instead of reading this book.Lessons in Chemistry was rife with issues. A non-exhaustive list:🧪Elizabeth is a SCIENTIST in the 1950s but reads like someone time traveled back from 2022 just to spout feminist monologues at anyone within earshot!!!🧪Elizabeth is an elite rower on her very first day!!!! No need for any background in sports whatsoever!!! She can keep up with 6'4"" men! Makes perfect sense bc......... feminism!! Keeping up with the boys!!! Etc!🧪Elizabeth is VERY SEXY. She neither knows nor cares that she is sexy, puts no effort into her appearance, but the author makes sure we know that she is The Hot One. bc she is smart AND sexy. Or something.🧪Elizabeth is a SCIENTIST, ergo she only thinks in LOGIC. She is actually a cyborg without feelings and without any idea of how human interactions work!! We know this based on how cringy every single interaction she has is!!!🧪Elizabeth uses aforementioned LOGIC to disprove religion!!!! Checkmate, theists everywhere!!!!! Elizabeth has cracked the case!!!!!Overall, extremely ridiculous and unrealistic. Next.",1
35,Lessons in Chemistry,"(I'd recommend reading Jan's review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), because it gets at a lot of the stuff I had an issue with in this book.)I had misgivings going into this, because its premise is 'one fierce woman in the 1960s uses her cooking show to teach the housewives of America what they're worth,' and that's a big white feminist fantasy red flag to me. Turns out, I was right, but oh my God I didn't know the half of it. This book is insane in ways that I couldn't even remotely predict from the premise.So this book centres on Elizabeth Zott, an impossibly intelligent woman with perfect 21st-century politics (also she's beautiful but she doesn't, like, care about that) who's been inexplicably plopped into a 1950s setting. She's a self-taught chemist, working on abiogenesis, which the book appears to think can low-key disprove religion (this book has a very weird relationship to religion - edgelord atheist vibes), but because it's the 1950s, she's forced out of her doctoral programme and undervalued at work. She strikes up a relationship with a powerful chemist who adores her, but he dies in an accident, leaving her unwed, pregnant and fired, doing consultation work so the men at her old lab can actually understand their results. Undeterred, she builds a lab at home, and ends up getting hired to a local cooking programme, which she converts into a serious scientific cooking programme that the housewives of America love because She Treats Them Like Adults.This all sounds relatively OK at first glance, but the tone is very off. This book is a mix of jaunty comedy and family drama, but there's a really graphic rape scene very early in the book, even though the spectre of rape is then played for laughs later because Elizabeth is All Powerful Now (another man pathetically waddles towards her with his trousers down, she pulls out a 14-inch knife and he has a heart attack on the spot). Structural misogyny is there enough to drive the book, but can also always be overcome through force of will or nicely timed plot conveniences. One of her viewers, a housewife with five kids, goes and becomes a doctor solely because Elizabeth is like 'yeah, sure, you can do that. Go take the tests.' Elizabeth literally says she's an atheist on air, pulls out a picture of Rosa Parks while chopping tomatoes, calls a sponsor 'poison', and this is depicted as causing a couple death threats and one half-baked bomb attempt, while her programme gets more and more popular. In 1960!So this book is a white liberal's dream: a woman blithely advocating gender and racial equality in a book with no characters of colour, where structural prejudice falls away if you're smart and correct and righteous enough. The instances of misogyny are all incredibly heavy-handed and didactic, with cartoonish misogynist men or silly unfeminist women who all say things like 'women should know their place' and 'blue is for boys and pink is for girls.' I hate, hate, hate how so many books right now treat their readers like they're idiots who don't know the absolute basics about history and context; at one point, Lessons in Chemistry actually says 'In the 1950s, abortion was out of the question.' As if we didn't know! Or couldn't be told in a less hamfisted way!But there's also one thing that ratchets up the ridiculous factor: the use of chemistry. God, the use of chemistry. I want to give this to a chemist so they choke to death on their own spit. To be clear, I'm not a pedant, or not too much of one - I don't care if literary fiction for nonspecialists is perfect on every point of chemistry. I care that its idea of a hyperintelligent chemist is one that says 'pass the sodium chloride' instead of 'pass the salt,' or sometimes calls water 'H2O', or calls vinegar 'acetic acid' (which is like calling orange juice 'citric acid', they're not the same thing), or says that they 'almost lost an atom in the isomerization process' while baking (what???). Madeline makes 'mud pies' by drawing 3.1415 in the mud. It's a very teenage nerd kind of approach, with an accompanying shot of the aforementioned edgelord atheism, and an instance of Elizabeth Publicly Owning a vegetarian by saying plants are also alive. In a couple of episodes of the programme, I glimpsed what a good implementation of the chemistry conceit might look like (the one with potato skin and glycoalkaloids was good), but too often it's cringe - particularly the extended metaphor around 'bonds' or the book's steadfast conviction that saying 'we had chemistry' is a deep and powerful statement.I'm not even going to get into the family drama that is technically kind of the core of the book, because it's convoluted and boring and appears to be there solely because there needs to be some resolution that isn't 'and the whole country became feminist. Hooray!'. But essentially, this book is entertaining (sometimes intentionally) but is also completely detached from any actual feminist politic, wilfully ignorant of class and race, hilariously inept vis-a-vis its central conceit, bludgeoningly unsubtle, and has independently rediscovered the fanfiction concept of the 'Mary Sue'. And it includes a dog that understands language and can talk to foetuses.P.S. Cambridge doesn't have rowing scholarships!",2
36,Lessons in Chemistry,"***WINNER OF GOODREADS 2022 DEBUT FICTION AWARD, THIS ONE IS SPECIAL***This is one of the most unusual books I’ve read this year.Elizabeth Zott is not your average person. She’s a brilliant, highly trained scientist who hasn’t gotten farther along in the world of chemistry simply because she’s a woman. She is working at the Hastings Institute performing a job that she is completely over qualified for!Through some crazy, at times hilarious encounter, she meets Calvin Evans. He is a gangly sort of guy but also a brilliant scientist and well-known at the Hastings Institute. Calvin had an intense love for rowing, that’s why he accepted the job at this lowly Institute when he could have been doing research at any number of universities. He came to California for the nice weather and the ability to row all year long.Fast forward and Elizabeth has a daughter named Madeline, Mad for short. Elizabeth was trying to work as a scientist at a lab in her home. She is a consultant for scientists who need and want her help, but it’s not enough to provide for herself and her daughter.Half way through the book I was already completely into the story and the amazing characters! What a unique and multi-layered plot.For reasons you will discover she begins a very unique cooking show!!!! I love to see her fiery spirit and determination to get what she wants, to dress how she wants. She is determined to raise her child how she wants. All the while she knows that she’s doing things outside of the normal or “average” mother, although Elizabeth would tell you that scientifically there is no “average person”!!!!This novel is fresh and innovative with characters just flying off the pages. I loved her new acquaintance, Walter, who talked her into doing the 6 o’clock show. He wants entertainment and she wants science in this cooking show!!!!I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK!!! I would like to give it more than 5*. I highly recommend this novel to EVERYONE, especially if you are a woman and have ever been looked down upon simply because you are female!!!I also wanted to add that there is a lot of humor in this book! And how could I forget “six thirty” the dog who know 600+ words! He is a narrator throughout the novel.JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU MEET HIM!!!!!!I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss. It was my pleasure to read and review this title.",5
37,Lessons in Chemistry,"Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie GarmusIt's the early 60s and chemist Elizabeth Zott is causing her usual ruckus at Hastings Research Institute. For one thing, she can't be a real chemist for the simple fact that she's a woman. Also, she won't make copies, get coffee, or do any of the other woman's work at the institute, and she's so cold and prickly she doesn't want to be touched or groped and isn't willing to provide ""favors"". Those are the reasons the men don't like Elizabeth. The women don't like her because she's attractive, she turns the heads of the men, and she doesn't know her place as a woman in a man's world.Also working at Hastings is Calvin Evans, a brilliant Noble prize nominee who has his very own massive lab where he can do who knows what and win more accolades. No one likes him either. Neither Calvin or Elizabeth care if anyone likes them, they just want to be left alone to do their jobs. But one day Elizabeth needs beakers and she knows Calvin has beakers so she barges into his lab and takes some. It's not love at first sight but it's pretty close and soon Elizabeth and Calvin are a very happy couple to the disdain of everyone who wishes them misery and failure.Elizabeth and Calvin even get a dog and name him Six-thirty. Then fate intervenes and Elizabeth and Six-thirty are on their own until baby Mad is born. Elizabeth never wanted children and she certainly never wanted to be a single mother. Elizabeth never wanted to be famous for a cooking show that she gets wrangled into hosting, either, but when money is tight, something has to give and now Elizabeth is fighting with her cooking show bosses rather than her Hastings Research Institute bosses. Elizabeth is famous for all the wrong reasons (according to her bosses) while the women who are glued to her show five days a week are seeing all the opportunities they never knew they had, to be more than housewives and mothers.This is a very funny story, with Six-thirty and Mad winning my heart immediately. It took a lot longer for me to warm up to Elizabeth but I finally did towards the end of the story. Life isn't fair, in fact, it's so unfair as to be criminal, and Elizabeth isn't sure how long she can go slogging along, not doing what she wants to do, which is important research as a chemist. There are a lot of really good side characters, a lot of really horrible side characters, and always, there is Calvin, locked away in Elizabeth's heart and dreams. I did have some issues with the story but overall it is humorous, clever, and allows Elizabeth to shine in all her intelligent glory. Even an afternoon cooking show can't hold her down or make her bend to what she doesn't believe.Pub: April 5th 2022Thank you to Doubleday Books and NetGalley for this ARC.",4
38,Lessons in Chemistry,"This contains trigger warnings.*sigh* I wanted to like this, I really did, and based on the premise I should have.First of all this is described as ""laugh out loud"", it isn't. It's also described as being in the same vein as 'The Marvellous Mrs Maisel,' it isn't.For something that is decribed as being hilarious, there was an awful lot of dark subject matter. While I understand that humour can be found in dark places etc, this wasn't it. The tone of the book was all over the place, like it didn't know what it wanted to be. It thought it was smarter and funnier than it was. I genuinely struggle to see what was so hilarious, I was mildly amused in some instances at most.During this 'hilarious' story, there is a brutal rape in chapter 3, death of a spouse, implied paedaphilia, abuse, abandonment, bullying, a second sexual assault and sexism. Again, I don't have a problem with the subject matter, I do have a problem with the execution of the subjects and the marketing of the book.Elizabeth as a main character just isn't that likeable. I get that she is supposed to be super intelligent and 'quirky' but she doesn't feel like a real person for much of the book, there is nothing to connect to. She also speaks like she is quoting from a textbook about sexism and feminism which does not feel genuine or organic. It felt more like the author was lecturing us. Also don't get me started about her daughter and how intelligent and advanced she was at a ridiculously young age. Of course she had a genius daughter. *eye roll*The cooking show doesn't come into play until at least half way through the book. Theres also a subplot regarding her husband's parentage which just felt...tiring by that point to be honest. Oh...we also get the dogs POV for alot of the story, which was a choice. To be fair, I was more invested and in the dog than Elizabeth and would have preferred the whole book in his voice. At least you could connect with him...the dog. 🤔The 2nd half of the book was a little better than the first and it had a more positive ending at least. I've given it 2 stars because I did like the love story between Elizabeth and Calvin, as short lived as it was. It was very sweet, with two lonely nerds and outcasts meeting and forming such a strong bond.",1
39,Lessons in Chemistry,"I don’t think anything I can say will do this book justice. I love it from beginning to end and it will most certainly be in my top five reads of 2021.It’s November 1961 and chemist Elizabeth Zott, who works at the Hastings Institute, has fallen into a TV role hosting ‘Supper at Six’ and has become an unlikely star in the ascendant. Cooking is chemistry, chemistry is life. Elizabeth is far from your average ‘60’s woman. For a start she’s a single mother to Mad Zott, shock, horror, especially to Mad’s odious teacher. Have I mentioned the dog, Six-Thirty? A divine canine, a failed bomb detection dog of remarkable emotional intelligence. Ten years earlier, same Institute, Calvin Evans, introvert, grudge holder, a genius, an exceptionally good rower and desperate to find a girlfriend meets Elizabeth Zott, also a grudge holder especially against the patriarchy. Chemistry in every sense of the word.Ok, here goes. It’s inspiring, heartwarming, sad, joyous, intelligent, funny, witty, quirky, original,highly entertaining, life affirmingly brilliant and genius in my opinion! It captures the times, the patronising way women are treated ( can you see my lip curl and a developing snarl?) the assumptions, the blatant sexism and way worse which shocks you to the core even though you know it’s all true. She uses chemistry to reveal the dangers of a lob sided society which is completely one sided and to demonstrate the false limits on the potential of 50% of the population. It’s so cleverly done and I’m a science dunce but it made sense to me! The dialogue is excellent, at times it’s laugh out loud funny as it’s so well phrased or the mastery of a put down or understatement. Elizabeth is quite simply fabulous, I love her and want to be her but I’ll certainly need to mug up on the chemistry! Equally amazing is Mad and yes, let’s go back to the dog. As a massive dog lover to have Six-Thirty as a character in his own right is admirable and it works so well. I adore him and want to adopt him. The relationships are excellent too, some are a meeting of minds or to nurture, of love and admiration, of kinship and some are of professional jealousy or sabotage.Overall, you’ll have gathered that I think this debut is amazing and I urge you to read it. It has every ingredient of a book that fascinates, delights, charms and engages. If for nothing else read it for Six-Thirty ... and to find his out he gets his name cos I’m not saying!!With thanks to NetGalley and especially huge thanks to Random House UK, Transworld Doubleday for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.",5
40,Lessons in Chemistry,"2.5 stars rounded up to 3. I have seen mostly all rave reviews from my friends on this one and thought I was going to love it too. I definitely had high hopes going into this book. For me personally, it was unfortunately just okay. It seemed to drag on and just wasn’t as interesting of a storyline as I hoped. I didn’t feel any real excitement reading it but I was happy with the ending. It’s readable and not a horrible book, just not for me.",3

42,Lessons in Chemistry,"Set in the 1950s and 1960s, Bonnie Garmus's offbeat comedic historical debut is a joyous and vibrant delight that will wrap its tentacles around your heart with its central protagonist, single mother and research scientist, the smart and beautiful Elizabeth Zott, whose passion for science has her seeing the world and people through the lens of Chemistry. Unfortunately for her, she lives in a time where it is believed that women have no place in science, it's a world where men dominate, control, exploit, patronise and silence women, sexually harrassing, lying, cheating and stealing her research, publishing and passing it off as their own. It doesn't stop there, men feel they can sexually assault a woman, and it will be the woman who pays the price, Elizabeth is forced to leave, unable to complete her PhD, with the police expecting her to 'regret' her behaviour, such are the rage inducing social norms and attitudes of the time.However, Elizabeth is no ordinary woman, she refuses to pander to fragile male egos, it worries her not one whit that she doesn't fit in at the patriarchal Hastings Institute, she accepts no limitations for herself, nor for anyone else. The chemistry between her and the star scientist, Calvin Evans, another man who does not fit either, leads to love, the two of them living together, Zott does not believe in marriage, and their religion is science. Circumstances result in Zott becoming a single mother to the precociously bright 4 year old, Mad, an early reader, voraciously consuming the likes of Norman Mailer and Charles Dickens. The challenges Zott faces, such as being fired for being pregnant and her dire financial circumstances has her becoming an unlikely, reluctant and uncompromising star, dressed in a lab coat, with her popular TV cooking show, Supper at Six, focusing on the chemistry of ingredients and recipes, carrying her subversive and radical agenda of making women question and challenge the cultural misogyny and the limitations placed on their lives. Needless to say, this makes her some implacable enemies.What makes the strong and independent Zott able to face the unrelenting harsh pressures and problems that come her way are her close knit and growing family, at the centre of which is their protective genius dog no-one will be able to resist, Six-thirty, familiar with more than 600 words, neighbour Harriet Sloane, rower Dr Mason, her TV producer, Walter Pine, and the Reverend Wakely, perhaps we can include Miss Frask too. This is a remarkable, hilarious and unforgettable debut from Garmus, outrageously entertaining, with oodles of charm, and I have no doubt that this will be a runaway success on publication. Do yourself a favour and read this brilliant novel. Highly recommended! Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.",5

The book is absolutely riveting!Lessons in Chemistry was the GoodReads 2022 Debut Novel of the Year, and Garmus is one to watch if this novel is her debut.One important idea discussed in this book is the idea of limits, defining what is possible. This is not just fiction.In 1954, Roger Bannister ran a mile in less than 4 minutes. Two months later, two more people ran the mile in less than 4 minutes. Now, more than 1,700 people have run the mile in less than 4 minutes.""No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof."" - Henry David ThoreauWhat are the limits that we accept as fact?Elizabeth Zott has a very strong sense of self, and she doesn't allow people to talk her into things.She isn't afraid to act and live differently, challenging society, politics, and religion.Lessons in Chemistry is such a powerful book without being preachy, and I greatly look forward to reading this one again.Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",5
44,Lessons in Chemistry,"WITTY and WONDERFUL -this is a MUST READ, laugh out loud DEBUT!Meet Elizabeth Zott.She is a brilliant Chemist, a staunch Atheist, and a determined Feminist.Most probably “on the spectrum” ( though this wasn’t recognized as such in the 1960’s) and most DEFINITELY ahead of her time, refusing to accept the status quo.In need of beakers for her Lab, she dares to take some from the Lab of Hasting Research Institute’s Nobel-prize nominated star-Calvin Evans-a loner who holds a grudge, but the result is nothing that could have been predicted! The two fall in love, adopt “Six Thirty”, the smartest and most resourceful dog EVER, and dare to move in together-out of wedlock. GASP!But, this isn’t a “Happily Ever After” love story.Fast forward a couple of years, and Elizabeth is now a single mother, with a PRECOCIOUS 4 year old to support. When she discovers another child is taking advantage of her daughter Mad (the name was accidental) during lunch break at school, she demands a face to face meeting with the little girl’s father.She leaves with much more than an apology.SOMEHOW, she has agreed to host a “cooking show” on TV-though she insists that her show is about Chemistry!The now RELUCTANT star of “Supper at Six” refuses to wear sexy dresses, insisting instead on a lab coat and the #2 pencil ✏️ she ALWAYS wears in her hair, or tucked behind one ear. (See it on the adorable book cover!)And, she won’t even recite the dinner ingredients in layman’s terms. YET, after the very FIRST episode airs, the station’s phones are ringing off the hook-All, I can say is “VINEGAR” ! 🤐Within 2 years, her show is a staple in every household, with those in the studio audience and at home taking notes -jotting down ingredients, recipes and chemical equations!Elizabeth, despite her lack of smiles, and her “no nonsense” approach has somehow struck a chord with the “housewives” she thought she had nothing in common with. It seems that she is teaching them to do more than “cook a sensible, nourishing dinner”.I loved tuning in to these episodes! 📺With the help of her “wise beyond her years” child, her overachieving dog, and a community of wonderful supporting characters, Elizabeth Zott-may just “change the world” one “thirty minute lesson at a time”!Thank You to Doubleday for my gifted copy!

45,Lessons in Chemistry,"Every single person I know needs to read this book. Not every woman..every person.An insightful, part tear-jerker, truly hilarious at times work with more than enough charisma to make you want to be the best version of yourself? That is Bonnie Garmus’s masterpiece:Lessons In Chemistry.Find all my favorite #womeninSTEM novels here!A SHORT PREVIEW:When Elizabeth Zott is growing up… the only thing she knows for certain is that she likes science. During the 1960s, while she was working at the Hastings Institute on groundbreaking research in abiogenesis – gender equality was nonexistent (even among scientists who should know better.) Life takes her through unexpected turns into falling in love with her co-worker Calvin Evans. Years later, as a single mother, Elizabeth finds herself the star of a live cooking show: Supper at Six. With her… unique… approach to cooking and can-do-attitude… Elizabeth finds herself teaching women more than to cook. She’s teaching them to value themselves and change the world.THOUGHTS:This is one of those books that reminds us we can absolutely do anything we put our minds to, even in the face of challenging circumstances. So much of Elizabeth’s character revolves around building herself up and building up the women around her.. she somewhat reminds me of Jessica Chastain’s character in The Help? (Another incredible book/movie adaptation!) She doesn’t care that society’s expectations of her dictate a certain kind of life. The book’s take on what women really go through in the most thankless job in the world: motherhood and ‘keeping house’ are insights that we all truly need!P.S. ‘Lessons in Chemistry’ is coming to Apple TV in 2023! Be on the lookout!Content Warnings: S3xual Ass4ult is mentioned more than once, and once in somewhat graphic detail. If you want to read this book and skip that graphic scene – skip pages - you'll know when it's coming. You’ll still get the overall feel of the book! This is also the reason I took away half a star but am still rounding up overall. I don't think violence against women needs to be in that graphic of detail because, like vi0lent video games, it desensitizes the masses to things that aren't acceptable/deplorable/horrific, etc.↑↑↑↑ Update 4/10/2023 ↑↑↑↑So far this book is really amazing at about 40% of the way in.

46,Lessons in Chemistry,"I have a lot of thoughts. For the sake of my own energy and sanity, I’m just going to bullet point the things I want to say:•I read several reviews prior to reading that spoke to the harmful white feminism portrayed in this book and I agree with those reviews. Elizabeth Zott is the ideal, amazingly beautiful, shockingly intelligent white woman who is discriminated against due to her gender, and her feminist “rants” reek of privilege. Especially when using slavery as a comparison to being a housewife? No. Not the same.•Her daughter, Madeline, was so over the top it was ridiculous. She “befriended” a priest and investigated her father’s family tree? At age 4? It’s weird.•Elizabeth is ANNOYING. Like…SO annoying. Both my parents have PhDs in research chemistry and I can attest to the fact that they call salt SALT and vinegar VINEGAR. And they know how to have social interactions with other humans.🙄 Because they aren’t PRETENTIOUS!! Also, it’s unrealistic that just because she knows one area of chemistry she automatically knows how to cook and knows all the biological reactions that occur in the body. There are a million different avenues of chemistry, and food science is COMPLETELY different than “abiogenesis” which was supposedly her main area of study. So you’re telling me she’s just an expert at literally all chemistry? 🤔 I call BS. Elizabeth Zott is the EPITOME of a “I’m not like other girls” girl. No please.✋🏼 Women can be smart AND socially adept.•The way the author pits science and religion against one another is exhausting. As if a person couldn’t possibly have a rational, scientific brain and also believe in something supernatural. 😑 She relies HEAVILY on negative stereotypes of the Catholic Church to prove her point that religion is ignorant, and I’m just tired of this argument. It’s boring, small-minded, and irritating to belittle someone or a group of people you personally disagree with REGARDLESS OF WHAT CAMP YOU’RE IN. Can we be adults and agree to disagree without being petty and taking a shot at someone’s intelligence?•This book is marketed as being funny. It’s not. It’s heavy with sexism, rape, implied pedophilia, and death. It’s not funny at all?Overall, I’m really disappointed by this book. It’s such a waste, because it was well written and I found myself weirdly entertained. Although, the farther removed from the book I get, the more problematic I find it.",2
47,Lessons in Chemistry,"Five big starsI love books with quirky, intelligent characters. So, I was immediately drawn to Lessons in Chemistry. Elizabeth Zott is a chemist in the early 1960s, back when women were a rarity in the field. Headstrong and independent, she refuses to tow the line expected. I came more than a decade later, but men’s attitudes hadn’t changed much in the 70s. So, I totally related to her, especially her relationship with Six Thirty.The book follows her as she becomes a single mother and then the star of a tv cooking show. There is a dry humor to the book. Actually, the humor gets more broad as the story goes on. I started off chuckling. Then snorting. Then laughing out loud to the point my husband insisted on knowing what I was reading.I sometimes have a problem when dogs are anthropomorphized. But it didn’t bother me here, even when his thoughts were included. I only wish my dog understood 900 words.The writing here is smart, descriptive, engaging. I found myself chortling over phrase after phrase - the sheer exactness of them. “Every day she found parenthood like taking a test for which she had not studied. The questions were daunting and there wasn’t nearly enough multiple choice.” Not only did I love the immediate family of Elizabeth, Madeline and Six Thirty, I adored Mrs. Sloane, Dr. Mason, Rev. Wakefield, Walter. While the book is humorous, there’s also a lot of emotion packed into it. I adored the ending. (I also loved that Garmus thanked her dogs in her Acknowledgments.) I even loved that I learned a thing or two about cooking.I can’t recommend this enough. I can’t wait to see what Ms. Garmus comes up with next.My thanks to Netgalley and Doubleday Books for an advance copy of this book.Update - I just read this a second time for my book club. If possible, I think I loved it even more the second time.",5
48,Lessons in Chemistry,"Everything I love in a book—smart women, great dog, found family. Excellent read.I adored chemist Elizabeth Zott. She's trying to exist in the ""good old boys"" world of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Where the woman's place is in the home, remaining silent, and following along with what the men say. Yet Elizabeth isn't wired that way, and the journey of this book shows her humor, warmth, and intelligence in a way that baffles the status quo.This novel is uplifting, at times infuriating, and still every time heartwarming and encouraging. We all could use a bit of Elizabeth Zott in our lives (and a smart wonderful dog like Six-Thirty)Highly recommended.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.",5
49,Lessons in Chemistry,"Anything less than a 5-star review for Bonnie Garmus’s debut novel is a minority opinion, so take my 4-star thoughts with a grain of salt. Or as the book’s heroine Elizabeth Zott would say, a grain of sodium chloride.Lessons in Chemistry tells the story of a brilliant scientific mind in the 1960s. Only problem is that the mind is in the body of the woman. Not just any woman, but an atypical one who has no interest in marriage or the other traditional trappings of domestic life. Still, one thing leads to another, and she finds herself with a daughter living in the suburbs. Because of the gender roles of that era, her passions and talents for chemistry are going to waste until she ends up with a nightly television show teaching other women how to cook. “Suppers at Six” finally gives home-bound, invisible moms a platform to ask questions, dream big, and prioritize themselves. It also puts items like “acetic acid” on their shopping lists. (That’s vinegar for all you non-sciency types like me.)I enjoyed my time with Elizabeth Zott and look forward to whatever Bonnie Garmus writes next. My slight hesitation in fully recommending Lessons in Chemistry is that it deals with some very serious themes. One major scene and plot point deals with sexual assault, and I just wish it hadn’t gone allllllll the way there. I think when picking up a book like this I’m looking to escape darker reads that include violence against women. Alas, rape, lather, rinse, repeat. Sigh.The novel’s manuscript was snatched up in a bidding war for adaptation rights by Apple TV+ pre-publication, so actress Brie Larson is already cast to play Elizabeth Zott. If the series is faithful to the novel, it’ll end up feeling like a #metoo-era feminist woman took a time machine back to the 1960s. I’ll definitely be tuning in when it debuts, but personally I hope it softens the novel’s sharp edges a bit.Blog:https://www.confettibookshelf.com",4
50,Lessons in Chemistry,"2.5May Contain SpoilersI'd never agreed more with the messages of a novel however, I grumbled throughout this audiobook. It's as if Garmus took every feminist rhetoric, issue and stance and made Elizabeth Zott the denouncer of every.single.one - gender pay gaps, stay-at-home mothers not being appreciated, women in STEM, working women, sexual harassment and the whole gamut of issues. I had to double-check the period this novel was set in. There were quite a few aspects that felt anachronistic. Anachronisms drive me crazy and their presence ruined many historical novels for me. I also think it's lazy and assumes that the readers are ignorant, not to mention, that it doesn't take that long to google.And then there was the preachiness, and the monologues, and the overexplaining. Oh, and it's all tell no show. Also, I got no sense of the time and place.I'm a staunch feminist and I agreed and/or recognised most issues, still, I just found this novel annoying, heavy-handed, and way too on the nose.I like my literature nuanced and I don't want things to be (over)explained, I am (still) capable of chewing my own food/ideas, thank you very much.",2
51,Lessons in Chemistry,"“Do not allow your talents to lie dormant ladies. Design your own future. When you go home today, ask yourself what you will change. And then get started”Four stars for an unapologetic feministic story that gets it right most of the time. Reflective a lot of the time. Funny sometimes. Cringe worthy – yes sometimes that as well.Elizabeth Zott has a brilliant mind, so she believes but not a view shared by many men, except Calvin Evans. A man who has created his own rule book and because of his prized work is revered. Yet a man who shares Elizabeth’s passion for chemistry, igniting a romance and a discovery of soul mates that was not destined to last, when Calvin’s life was cut short prematurely.The sad turn of events leads Elizabeth to begin hosting a TV show where her cooking techniques use the unconventional notion and language of chemistry to educate her viewers.With a book titled ‘lessons’, it is only right to share a few of life’s lessons that Elizabeth is guided by1.	If you fail, don’t admit it. You have just found the million reasons why something wouldn’t work - I must try that!!!!2.	Don’t work the system outsmart it - yes I agree to that3.	Fearless in the kitchen translates to fearless in life - I wish !!!4.	The best strategy is not to fear the danger but respect it - great lesson5.	Take risks don’t be afraid to experiment - depends on the experiment 😁With the focus on experimentation, chemistry, and the female role. Lessons in Chemistry is a book that encourages us to think beyond cultural simplicity, acknowledge that some of our own achievements are limited by those restrictions we place on ourselves and fight to change the things in your life that matter. You know as the saying goes ‘anything worth having is worth fighting for’.If you don’t take the book too seriously and literally then you might love, it. If you try to analyse all the messages and connect it to your personal situation, then you might tear it apart.I for one enjoyed this story. As a debut it was certainly original, as a means of delivering messages it was convincing, as a woman I was less convinced about Elizabeth hence the 4 stars. However, for entertainment it was certainly an excellent choice.",4
52,Lessons in Chemistry,"""Lessons in Chemistry"" by Bonnie Garmus is a delightful debut novel!Elizabeth Zott, a research chemist at Hastings Research Institute, believes in equality, not a popular opinion in 1952. The all male research team she works with talks down to her rather than appreciating her as the driving force behind their projects. She's weary of males talking over her when she presents her findings and taking credit for her work.The one exception to this is Calvin Evans, a gifted research scientist at HRI, and a two time Nobel-prize nominee, who has fallen in love with Elizabeth and her brilliant mind. The attraction is real!Elizabeth views herself as a scientist but knows, by experience, female scientists are virtually non-existent. Ten days before graduating with her master's degree from UCLA, the admissions committee rescinded her application to the doctoral program.An 'unfortunate event' happened and Elizabeth actions were determined to be the cause. She knows that getting her PhD is no longer possible but she'll never give up her dream. Her only regret is not having more No. 2 pencils to use when the 'unfortunate event' took place!Ten years later, Elizabeth is a single mother living with her adorable daughter, Madeline, their dog, Six-thirty, and hosting the daily TV cooking show, Supper at Six. The show is an instant hit and Elizabeth is the beautiful, but reluctant, star!In front of a live audience, Elizabeth uses her platform to not only teach women about the chemistry of cooking, but about life being more important than cooking! It's about following your dream of having a family and a career just like men do!What a delightful story with a mid 20th Century timeline. If I could spend time with a character, it would absolutely be Elizabeth. I applaud her resilience, resourcefulness, and unwavering belief that women are as worthy as men. If I was in her shoes, I would wear a No. 2 pencil behind my ear or in my hair, too!A bit of a rebel, smart as a whip, she speaks her mind without holding back, and believes in what's right. She loves her daughter and Six-thirty, the dog, who knows 600+ words and has a significant role in this story. He's quite the canine character and loves Madeline and Elizabeth as much as they love him. It's pretty special!This is an amazing debut novel with quirky characters, socially relevant topics, emotional swings, winks of humor and laugh-out-loud moments! I loved this story and I highly recommend this book!Thank you to NetGalley, Doubleday Books, and Bonnie Garmus for a free ARC of this book. It has been an honor to give my honest and voluntary review.",5
53,Lessons in Chemistry,"This is a Historical Fiction book. I had so many different feelings about this book. I really did not like Elizabeth's character in this book. I did not like that Elizabeth was so smart, but she was so dumb at the same time. I hate that she did not see people walking all over her. I also did not think she really put a fight for women rights. I just felt she did everything to make things hard on herself. I really wanted to love this book, but I just did not. I hated the first half of this book, and the second half of this book I liked not loved. I also did not understand the dog stuff, and I felt all the dog stuff was weird. I found parts of this book funny. The ending was good, but I saw it coming. I was kindly provided an e-copy of this book by the publisher (Doubleday Books) or author (Bonnie Garmus) via NetGalley, so I can give an honest review about how I feel about this book. I want to send a big Thank you to them for that.",3
54,Lessons in Chemistry,"This is theModern Mrs Darcy Book ClubJuly 2022 selection and aSummer Reading Guide Minimalist Pick.A life-affirming tale of a chemist ahead of her time, a life-changing love affair, a dog with a huge vocabulary, and the combustible combination of chemistry, cooking, and afternoon television. Elizabeth Zott only ever wanted to be a scientist—but because she’s a woman in the 1960s, she has to go begging for beakers despite being the smartest researcher in the building. After Elizabeth is ostensibly fired for being unwed and pregnant (but really for being smarter than her boss and dating a rival scientist he loathes), she can’t make ends meet. Out of desperation she accepts a job hosting a tv show called Supper at 6. She loves to cook, because cooking, after all, is chemistry. The producers want her to smile and look pretty, but Elizabeth is much more interested in teaching housewives not just how to make dinner, but how to change their lives. Lively and life-affirming, with an unforgettable protagonist. Content warnings apply.For fans of Jennifer Ryan’sThe Kitchen Frontand Ann Patchett’sThe Dutch House, with interesting parallels toLike a House on Fire.",5
55,Lessons in Chemistry,DNF259 pages in and I just cannot.The premise and the summary were spot on my cup of tea.I love Elizabeth Zott and her ball busting ways.I love a story with a dog.All good reasons to buy this book.Slam on the brakes now:I don’t love books that do that anthropomorphic thing with dogs.I WAS WILLING TO FORGIVE THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE STORY.I do not love a 4 year old child - whether a genius or not - that is given an adult role in a story.I WAS ANNOYED BUT STILL WILLING TO READ FORWARD.I do not love being force fed an agenda that God does not exist and that religion is dumb. It’s okay for a character to grapple with these issues. It’s not okay for every character to take what is clearly the author’s belief system and spread it over the whole book. This creates one dimensional writing and that’s when I tap out.PAIRING THE GENIUS 4 YEAR OLD WITH THE HARVARD EDUCATED REVEREND WAKELY IN A FACE-OFF BETWEEN RELIGION AND SCIENCE FOR WHICH THE REVEREND STRUGGLES TO HOLD HIS OWN WAS THE END OF THE ROAD FOR ME.I really wanted to finish this one. Really. Really.Boo.,1
56,Lessons in Chemistry,"Feminist comedy chick lit?I’d heard conflicting opinions and had determined this wasn’t for me. But several friends assured me I’d enjoy it, and it’s currently 53% at 5* and less than 1% at 1* on GR.The first page was good! It conjured women’s limited choices of 1961 in a wry way that I liked:“Before anyone knew there’d even be a sixties movement… when the big wars were over and the secret wars had just begun and people were starting to think fresh and believe everything was possible.”The plot had promise, too. Elizabeth Zott is a chemist in academia, but is forced out before her doctorate because of the misogyny of the times. When she finds success as a reluctant star of daytime TV, she subverts the genre by making her cooking show about chemistry, not domesticity.ContentThe first half (pre-TV) was OK-ish. The second half was ever more ludicrous, and not really funny or feminist, as it descended to sentimental and largely predictable mush.The whole book is packed with clichés, caricatures, and coincidences, but they’re most egregious in the final chapters.Patriarchy, pencils in the hair (see cover art of some editions), sexual assault, rowing (boats, not arguments), a kindergarten family-tree project, and the corrupting power of money all feature prominently.Image:A mixed pair of rowers: students Jodie Cameron and Ryan Glymond at the 2021 British Championships(Source)On screenIronically, I think this might work better as a sit-com than a book. It has elements of Stepford Wives and Desperate Housewives, with a dash of Edward Scissorhands.A few weeks later, I discovered it's being made into a TV series, starring Brie Larson. See imdbhere.BrilliantBunk - plus quirkFive year old Madeline has almost finished reading Dickens and is now readingThe Sound and the Fury. I can believe a gifted child could read the words, but I don’t believe any child that young would want to: it’s too far removed from anything they’d understand and care about.The dog, Six-Thirty, is even more advanced (hence, I’ve shelved this as magical-realism). I know dogs are clever and empathetic, but paragraphs of his profound and knowledgeable philosophising on oftenabstractconcepts were just silly. He even had opinions on Proust!There's lots of self-conscious quirk, some of which fits the period more plausibly than others, and much of it is based on stereotypes played for laughs, rather than realism. Like Elizabeth, my 20-something is a scientist at heart, with a passion for cooking. They've extended their skills beyond anything I've taught them by structured research and experimentation around the chemical reactions involved. But even they wouldn't call salt “sodium chloride” (except perhaps as a one-off joke), let alone vinegar by... whatever the chemical name was Elizabeth used on her TV show.Chemical bondsAttraction, bonding, change - all aspects of chemistry, loudly signposted in this book.Elizabeth is an odd mix of socially inept and effortlessly sexy. She and Calvin Evans both have tragic backstories that leave them conveniently free of family ties, but with an air of mystery that may or may not be revealed: the means are largely unscientific. Also, despite their joint obsessions with science and rowing, they don't really consider the physics of the sport, which is out of character.Image:Abiogeneis- which is what Elizabeth Zott really wants to investigate(Source)",2
57,Lessons in Chemistry,"I have a really hard time rating books poorly because I’m a firm believer that there’s some valuable lesson to be found in every story even if it’s not your cup of tea. However, I found myself having a visceral reaction throughout this book. I don’t like writing lengthy reviews, but I’m pretty heated by it.I also want to preface that I am a real-life woman chemist, one who also studied food chemistry and does science communication (scicomm) work, so I probably wasn’t the target audience. I found that the book felt very much like it was meant for the popsci “science doesn’t care about your feelings” crowd with major doses of white feminism trying to look intersectional but failing.And before I dive deep into examples of why I disliked this book, I want to mention that the story has been optioned for a streaming series. In case any producers or the author see this review: PLEASE reach out to the American Chemical Society. ACS worked directly with the producers of Breaking Bad to help ensure there was accurate representation of chemistry. Doing this matters. Improper representation of science in media has dire consequences in society, such as unrealistic forensic expectations in jury trials. As much as I disliked this book, I recognize that the tv show could be the first time many women/girls see a female chemist outside of cop shows, so I really want it to do a good job.Okay, now I will resume my griping.1. The ScienceI was immediately drawn to the premise of the book because I’m a chemist and I *love* fiction authored by scientists, so I thought this would be great! But the author isn’t a scientist apparently, and it becomes very obvious with how the characters talk in chemical formulas? What? That’s not a thing we do. Chemical formulas are a shorthand for writing, but we use the names. And at one point, the main character (supposedly a brilliant chemist) apologizes for the mess due to a misbalanced centrifuge. Y’all. Misbalanced centrifuges in the 1960s are SO DANGEROUS. This is simply not a quirky endearing mess a scientist would make in the midst of their genius—it’s something that would have disastrous consequences and quite likely kill someone, depending on the size of the centrifuge. Imagine treating someone accidentally hitting the accelerator instead of the brakes when a kid runs out in the middle of the road as a quirky example of your driving abilities—it’s of that scale of seriousness. I am also really appalled by how canned foods were demonized. In a scene of the cooking show, the protagonist discusses mushrooms. She tosses aside canned cream of mushroom soup as “poison.” Y’all, this got me so heated. You cannot just call an accessible form of food poison without offering any explanation. Canned foods were an important preserving technology used at the time, and to this day canned foods provide nutritious foods in a way that is safe to the environment. What impact is this gonna make on readers? Food deserts exist, and you can’t just demonize canned foods like that without any explanation. Oh and there was a weird episode of the cooking show where the analogy to explain chemical bonds was…geopolitics? What? It made no sense.Overall, this book is just filled with unnecessary jargon that feels like it’s trying to sound smart without saying anything, which is frustrating as hell. Jargon makes science inaccessible to people, and it feels like a story about empowering housewives to pursue their STEM dreams should focus on demistifying science rather than feeling like a chick lit version of The Big Bang Theory.2. The MoodThis book is described as “hilariously funny”. I wish it were. I think it tries to be funny, but then it has some seriously heavy themes that it does not handle gently. There are two sexual assault scenes, and the main love interest dies pretty early on in an awful scene. It was a lot.3. The CharactersY’all, I hate the protagonist. She’s so two dimensional. The absolute smartest chemist in the institute, always talks in jargon even when it’s absolutely unnecessary, yet somehow is so charismatic to become a lead of a tv show with no television credits? What? And once she’s the star of the show, she makes really unreasonable demands about how it should be run and it’s presented like it’s #feminism rather than being unreasonable and awful. And the love interest is a complete asshole to everyone, yet manages to treat the protagonist with a modicum of respect, so of course she falls madly in love with him. I really don’t find any of the side characters to be interesting or compelling—in fact, they all felt like caricatures. I’m also baffled by including the dog’s POV? Also confused by how he went from running away from bombs to successfully finding the purse bomb and delivering it safely? Also why was the dog working in the lab? Literally do not understand any of these choices.4. The PoliticsThere is no way that a woman in the 60s would discuss secularism and socialism on air. This absolutely killed any suspension of disbelief I might have had. This made the book feel like some weird fantasy of the era.5. The Religious CommentaryI’m honestly galled by this even as an atheist. This book felt like a pretty direct attack on religious beliefs? So many of the characters made their hatred of religion to be such a big part of their personalities, and it was so off-putting. You can be a scientist and religious. It’s okay. It doesn’t make you a bad scientist, and I really hate that this books presents it that way. While I’m not religious, I have several friends and colleagues who are and they do excellent science. This really felt like a weird author vendetta that went against the mission of empowering women in STEM.",1

It's either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don't read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I'm tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.The WritingThe title of this book is stupid. It's stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It's solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can't borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That's just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha's hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can't be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I amnotgoing to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attemptedrapeof Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it's probably okay now, and then she getssexually assaultedby Tamlin, who wasstill high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn't see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn't move—I couldn't think.Before, during and after theattack, she's thinking,Wow, he's really hot. I'm kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it's okay that he's drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is avery wrong and dangerous way of thinking.No matter what, it isneverokay foranyoneto make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they've given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there's Rhysand's behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to""dance""for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn't actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn't give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost madelesssense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I'm notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn't know what YA means and isn't aware she's actually writing for NA.The WorldbuildingThe Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They're not even cleverly unique faeries. They're just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don't have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.The CharactersFaerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn't really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn't see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves becauseTamlin impies that she's gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen.She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren't a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don't even care about this guy tbh. He's a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He's violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that's not a contradiction. There's a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that's saying a lot, because they didn't have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese's Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he's a dangeroussociopathwith a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He's a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There's already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn't very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn't important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I've ever seen.Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That's the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It's not a fantasy name.ConclusionWhile I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I've encountered on the internet, I don't really care about this series very much. Frankly, it's not good.",1
59,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)","That was both horrible and incredible at the same time, and my thoughts are a whirlwind.Note: The first part of this review is spoiler-free, but the second half is most definitely not. The spoilery section is blocked off by siren emojis (🚨). Skip to the end for bonus content, including an ACOTAR rap written by yours truly.This is the story of a mortal girl, Feyre, who kills a Fae in the woods one day. She’s whisked away to Prythian, home of the Fae, where she will live the rest of her days as punishment for murdering the wolf.Whoever said this was a Beauty and the Beast retelling is clearly not okay. This is far from a retelling, becauseit takes all the important themes outand leaves just the bare plotline:1. The Beast (Tamlin) is not ugly or even a beast at all. He just has a mask stuck to his face forever as part of a curse that I will get into more in the spoilery section.2. We are not aware of any good reason for Tamlin to keep Feyre until the very end, and it’s still a flimsy reason (this relates back to the curse).The problem with the plot is that the foreshadowing is so faint. The plot in the beginning and up until the 75 percent mark makes no sense at all. Tamlin takes Feyre to live in luxury, with good food and nice clothes and freedom, because she killed his fellow Fae? It’s just nonsensical.How is that a punishment at all?She no longer has to care for her spoiled sisters, she’s away from the poor village.However, it does make sense in the end, but Feyre is very naive for believing all of this. Something doesn’t add up. People who DNF this book will be very confused indeed.In Beauty and the Beast, we know of the curse beforehand, so we can find a good reason for the Beast to be kind to Belle. But Tamlin? It’s a mystery.So anyway, Feyre gets taken to a land of luxury to live out the rest of her days in comfort as “punishment,” but she’s still not happy because for some reason she misses her sisters, even though they treated her like dirt.She falls in love with Tamlin, which was expected because he’s not a Beast. There’s no barrier to overcome here.She isn’t forced to look past his ugly exterior because he has no ugly exterior.Along the way, another Fae named Lucien conveniently reveals everything Feyre needs to know right before it happens. This is supposed to be foreshadowing? I think? But in the end, he makes things so easy for Feyre and there’s no conflict whatsoever.The only problems arise from Feyre’s own stupidity.Their exchanges basically go like this:Lucien: The Suriel are super dangerous and even hard for the Fae to trap so stay away.Feyre: *makes simple snare* *kills chicken* oOpS I caught one, what a coincidence!!Everything is far too easy for Feyre.She’s supposed to be a responsible hunter, but instead she makes stupid, reckless decisions that don’t line up with her character. She follows an illusion of her father despite being told it’s fake, she goes outside on Fire Night, she chases the Suriel, she goes after Tamlin… etc.If you tell her not to do something, she will do it.Lucien: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Tamlin: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Literally everyone ever: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Feyre: *gets a midnight snack*Feyre is trying to figure out the details of this blight that’s supposed to be taking over Prythian, but luckily for her, Lucien and Tamlin give everything away with no struggle whatsoever.The result is thatthe danger does not feel genuine.It feels like a cheesy way to add angst to the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin.Speaking of Tamlin, everyone hates him so much but he’s such a sweetheart. I know that he gets worse in ACOMAF, but there’s nothing wrong with him in this book. He may be a little bland, but he’s much better than Rhysand. More details in the spoilery section.And then we have the writing, which is just bad. “...” is used in every other sentence, the poor em dashes are abused, and Feyre’s bones bark. A lot. Like, every time she falls down, she describes her barking bones. And what’s up with the phrase “my bowels turned watery?” It’s used at least twice and I don’t like it at all. This is notShatter Me.🚨🚨🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨🚨🚨So, what’s up with Amarantha?I really do like her. She’s a compelling villain because she’s (somewhat) realistic. Sure, she tortures people for fun, but her backstory makes this seem (somewhat) reasonable. (Somewhat.)Basically, she kidnaps Tamlin and Feyre runs after them because she has no self-preservation instinct. She challenges Amarantha, and in return, she is given three trials. If she wins them all, she and Tamlin will be free and his powers will return. If she loses… well, Amarantha keeps saying that there wouldn’t be enough left of Feyre to burn.However, Amarantha gives her a different option. She could solve a riddle.This is when things go downhill. First of all, why would Amarantha bet all her power and might on a simple riddle? It’s not even that hard to solve. The riddle itself is bad. The rhyming pattern isn’t great. And worst of all, the answer?It’s love.The answer is love.How does this make sense? Amarantha is a brutal, sadistic villain, so why would she write such a cliche, cheesy riddle?She should have made it oddly specific so Feyre would never get it.Anyway, Feyre answers it correctly at the last minute, Amarantha loses all her power, and Tamlin kills her.It was far too easy.Moving onto Rhysand. I hate him with a burning passion. He’s a greasy, crusty, dusty, musty old man. I can’t believe Feysand is the endgame ship. I’m suing. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand how people love him. He’s abusive, uncomfy, and weird.People keep telling me that I will love Rhysand in ACOMAF and hate Tamlin. First of all, I highly doubt it.Second of all,if you have to rely on making one character a villain just to get people to like the other character, that’s bad writing.Finally, the curse is so specific and random. Tamlin has to fall in love with a mortal girl who hates the Fae so much that she killed one in cold blood, and he has to wear a mask, and she can't know it's a curse.🚨🚨🚨END OF SPOILERS🚨🚨🚨In conclusion: Feyre is an idiot, Tamlin is precious, and Rhysand deserves to rot in a hole.Also, I wrote a rap.

60,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)","Clearly I'm in the minority here. DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail's pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions ofBeauty and the Beastthat I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I feltCruel Beautyamong other B&B retellings I've read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I'm sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything's just dandy and things will make sense, and I'd be like ""ooooooh, so that's why ____."" Me, I don't care. Ain't nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I'm just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who's implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here's roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there's Belle's dad. Belle's dad wanders into Beast's castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn't like the fact that Belle's dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle's dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle's valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There's a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book.Things are far, far too easy with this book.Now here's this version of Beauty and the Beast,a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely,from the little that I have read.There'sFeyrewho has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don't care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there's only so much I can take.While hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who's a Fae in disguise) away from her family.“What is the payment the Treaty requires?”His eyes didn’t leave my face as he said, “A life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.”A life for a life!Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That's what a life for a life means, right?WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.“Some would say it’s unwise to insult a Fae in his home,” Tamlin ground out. “Some would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.”So what?!Why?!This makes no sense at all.Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother.In exchange, there isabsolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.Another useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis’s offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic—this one of purple so deep it could have been black.Clearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they're revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape.It doesn't make any sense!“There is … a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act … strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks”—he tapped on his—“are the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can’t remove them.”Over and over and over,the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.“So there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?” Maybe they’d know how to free me from the Treaty’s terms.“Yes,” he said tightly. “The Suriel. But they’re old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.And then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.I do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn't feel like it, because she is ""inconsequential."" In fact, they're more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.“My morning work was postponed,” he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. “If you want a ride across the grounds—if you’re interested in your new … residence, I can take you.”And teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle's love for reading.“I could help you write to them, if that’s why you’re in here.”Feyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.“Do you ever stop being such a prick?” I snapped back.Dead—really, truly, I should have been dead for that.But Lucien grinned at me. “Much better.”As I said, I'm sure this book improves in the end, but from what I've read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue.",2

62,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)","2 1/2 stars.Maybe my rating comes as a surprise or even - if you care - a disappointment, but let me assure you: no one is more surprised or disappointed than I am.I've had this book on my TBR ever since it appeared on Goodreads without a title, cover or description. I started reading it as soon as it became available and the array of positive reviews from my friends and strangers alike made me feel sure I would love it. But I didn't. It is possible I expected all the wrong things fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, and maybe my review can prevent others from doing the same.Here's what I expected:an intricate fantasy world, supernatural politics and alliances, fast-paced action, a sensual romance - perhaps similar toCruel Beautyand otherBeauty and the Beastretellings, and a flawed but likable heroine.But this book is, if you ask me, nothing more or less thansoftcore erotica. Which is fine, if that's what you're looking for.I personally thought that the fantasy aspect felt like trimmings around a story that was all about a romance between Feyre (the narrator) and Tamlin (a High Lord of the Fae). There are some titillating scenes where Tamlin bites Feyre's neck and they have sex - undoubtedly the best bits of the book and I won't pretend I didn't feel a little hot under the collar myself. But the ""ancient wicked shadow"" promised in the blurb is only really a source of more romantic angst for Feyre and Tamlin.However, I *do* like a good romance as much as anyone, so there are other reasons this book didn't quite work for me. In order to express what I mean, I'm going to compareA Court of Thorns and RosestoCruel Beauty, which is, in my opinion, a better book.In CB, I felt the chemistry between Nyx and Ignifex as soon as their loaded banter started to fill the pages. They were sexy together, Ignifex was an evil ruler (which was a real problem for their relationship) with blood-red eyes, and the supernatural part of the book was creepy, weird and completely unique. Despite enjoying the actual non-PG scenes inA Court of Thorns and Roses, I never felt any real chemistry between Feyre and Tamlin or any realistic challenge to their relationship.What makesBeauty and the Beastsuch a compelling romance?One that demands to be told over and over again in so many different ways? I'll tell you what it is: it's the obstacles, the challenges, the improbability...how can a young woman come to love an ugly beast?We ask.I'll prove it's possible!The author replies. That's why readers fall in love with the beast again and again, even when he is furry and has horns like the Disney version. I loved the Disney beast.And that badass fox in Robin Hood so it's possible I have issues.Tamlin is not a beast.“Even as he bit out the words, I couldn’t ignore the sheer male beauty of that strong jaw, the richness of his golden-tan skin.”Oh my, how could a poor young woman ever love a pretty-faced, golden-haired, completely not evil Fae prince? How weird.Maas is a good writer and the beginning - before Feyre is taken to the Fae world - made me believe a great book was on the way. When Maas writes action, she writes actionreallywell. But there was far too little of it in this book. It came in behind the descriptions of beautiful Fae men and the Fae palace.In short:It just wasn't nasty enough.In truth, this felt more like an extended Cinderella retelling than what it was supposed to be. A girl lives in poverty and looks after her rather annoying sisters until one day she is swept up by a prince who takes her to his beautiful palace (after about three chapters). I just find it hard to recommend this when I thinkCruel Beautyis similar and yet so much better.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr",2
63,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)","4.45/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺This book’s mood song match –Fix You by Coldplaymum: *enters kitchen at 3 am* What the hell are you doing?me: *with a bowl of ice cream in one hand and ACOTAR in the other* I'm starting another SJM seriesmum: Hang on, I have a bottle of vodka here somewhere*And if this is not some relatable shit when facing Sarah J. Maas’s books then I don’t know what to tell you anymore. You puzzle me.So, there you go – another great universe erected by SJM just in front of our humble eyes. She is building her own fucking multiverse and we are here to witness the power of a goddess at work. I will make three sacrifices for that.This is, so far, for me, the best Beauty and the Beast reimagination.HER EXECUTION STYLE IS THE AIR TO MY LUNGS.And this one is not even the best of her works.“Magic – everything was magic, and it broke my heart.”Mainly, our action is happening at the Spring Court where our main character finds herself in front of a new intriguing life. Or at least as intriguing as a Court of flowery gardens can be.As I always say about SJM’s books,the characters are the ones who make the action. It’s like they are the very engine of a plot.I kind of likeFeyre. She definitely has her own personal issues, mainly because she is broken and lonely and desperate to beat her status. She is human and miserable, mainly because her family is horrible. Her whole family was created to look like the typical fairytale family – an absent coward of a father, an uninterested mother, a sister full of wicked hatred and another one caught up in her own world, sensitive and naïve. Until her sisters do something worthy of my affection, I ain’t changing my mind about them.Lucien(the Emissary of the Spring Court), I must say, I liked from the very beginning, but he somehow managed to grow on me. There was something likeable about him at first and he only proved that to me more as the action went on.Tamlin, the High Lord of the Spring Court, on the other hand, seemed a bit stiff the whole book, even though I sometimes appreciated the occasional softness of his heart.But full-on honesty now – thebestthing about this book, the one thing that made it 110% better wasRhysand. He won for this book a full star from me with all of his domineering prick moves. He played the bad boy role so good that my traitorous heart enjoyed him whole. I might have a problem but oh, what a perfect problem he is.“His voice was a lover’s purr that sent shivers through me, caressing every muscle and bone and nerve.”Sexy.Rhysand and Feyre certainly have a sort of total chemistry that it seems Feyre doesn’t have with Tamlin; not even after theysupposedlyfell in love with each other. I don’t buy that love for more than a second and by the end when everything seemed to try to make me believe their relationship I was still not convinced.I recognise fabulous chemistry when I see one and that ain’t it. Rhysand, you’d better act up, love, I have expectations. You’re more than just a cruel, beautiful ruffian, I know it.There’s a certain cruelty in this book, so very Maas. I sometimes feel like I’m reading the words of a psychopath, but then I remind myself how much Ienjoythis cruelty in these books and I temperate myself.That crazy wretch Amarantha is definitely the embodiment of cold murder and torture in this book and this is visible when it comes to how much her actions affect the other characters’ moods and movements. It’s terribly interesting though to see how terrified all of them can become when facing her.But by the end, there was this sliver of hope that lingered. And that broke the evil to pieces.“This wasn’t music to dance to – it was music to worship, music to feel in the gaps of my soul, to bring me to a place where there was no pain.”Even though I think this is not the best of SJM’s works, I still believe is so very good that just makes you want to know more. It leaves you craving. And in my humble opinion, that’s a bonus factor in books.All and all, my first step into the ACOTAR universe has been a success. More steps to come. Until I fall in love. Wholly and irrevocably.",4
64,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)","I cannot remember ever being this conflicted over a book. There are parts of A Court of Thorns and Roses I really loved, but a lot of parts I really hated.I went into this book fully expecting to love it. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales, and I was interested to see how SJM made the story her own.First off, my biggest problem with this story was Feyre as a character. I have never been so irritated. Her character development and personality, for the most part, didn't make sense to me. She was the caretaker of her entire family for years, supposedly a hunter with a strong survival instinct. And yet, she proceeded to make the stupidest decisions and put herself in danger time and time again. I didn't get the sense that she did this out of bravery, but more out of stupidity. It didn't mesh with what her character was supposed to be. Examples of these idiotic choices:1. Repeatedly plotting to escape into a faerie land that she knew to be deadly, when she was asleep on the way to the manor and obviously wouldn't know her way back to the mortal lands2. Running after the illusion of her CRIPPLED father at NIGHT, when she has been told and witnessed how deceptive fae can be3. Trapping a Suriel with little more than a snare, in the deadly part of the forest, after she has been told, and AGAIN, SEEN how dangerous these creatures are4. Going to Fire Night after being told how dangerous it is, not leaving after being almost raped by 3 faeries, and then proceeding to leave her room AGAIN afterwards5. Drinking the faerie wine at the Solstice, even after Lucien of all people warned her not to6. Leaving the manor when the Suriel flat out TOLD her not to and that she would be safe with Tamlin, and deciding to not mention that to ANYONE before he forced her to leaveIn addition to all of these idiotic choices, she also is incredibly inconsistent. She'll go from hating Fae to sympathizing with them to loving them back to fearing them at the drop of a hat. These inconsistencies are probably the most irritating, as there are scenes that I absolutely adore with Feyre, but then she goes back to doing the next pain in the ass thing on the next page.I also found her relationship with Tamlin to be problematic. Yes, I do enjoy problematic things (especially ships from time to time) but there were a lot of things I couldn't excuse with them. Again, more inconsistencies in characters' behavior. Tamlin's hot and cold behavior was eventually explained, but not until 70% of the way through the book. It was too little too late. Also,I found the Fire Night scene to be a problem for me. I do enjoy volatile relationships and bad boy characters. But only when we are told from the beginning that one of the characters is ""bad"". Tamlin we are led to believe is a saint, then he bites her and gets possessive, but all is forgiven the next morning. Because he's a ""nice guy."" No.The world building I found to be lackluster in a lot of ways. While I really enjoyed the wide variety of Fae creatures we got to see, I thought that a lot of the back story was revealed in a lazy way. Instead of having Feyre figure anything out for herself, important things are told to her through long monologues from a number of characters throughout the book. This happens numerous times.Additionally, few side characters have any development and most felt like blank slates. With that being said, the ones that were developed I adored. Lucien and Rhys saved the book for me in a lot of ways. I found them both to be complex and interesting characters.The last 10-15% of the book saved it for me. I found the plot to finally be interesting, and I found Feyre's decisions in those chapters to actually make sense. A lot of things were set up for future books that have me very intrigued, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. Many things that I disliked in this book, may in fact be remedied due to some of the occurrences in this last small section of the book.Overall, I was disappointed by this first installment. While there were elements I really enjoyed, they didn't make up for the elements I didn't. I'm hoping future installments will prove to be better.I will also be doing a full video review and spoiler-filled discussion on mychannelin the future if you want to know more of my thoughts.",2
65,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)","If you've ever wondered which literary world would be the best to live in, wonder no longer, cause there's aBookTube Videoto answer that!The Written Review:----------Update - 12/6/19ShouldI cross the insurmountable TBR? Or reread this series again?I think you know the answer----------Here's the original review:Feyre is huntingin the middle of the woods tokeep her useless starving family alive(Hunger Games, anyone?).A chance encounter with a wolf - who wasn't entirely a wolf - leaves Feyreon the wrong end of an ancient treaty.She is forced to go to the fairy realm to live out the remaining years of her human life -no friends, no family and no freedom.“Has anyone ever taken care of you?” he asked quietly.“No.” I’d long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it.At first, she cannot think of anything but escape. Slowly (but surely), she is swept into the fairy realm -in its magic & intrigue, in its danger & hopelessness, and in its wonder & glory.“Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dawn, Day, and Night,” it mused, as if I hadn’t even answered. “The seven Courts of Prythian, each ruled by a High Lord, all of them deadly in their own way. They are not merely powerful—they are Power.”Feyre lands in the Spring court - which is under amasquerade cursefor nearly fifty years.The court is being attacked by all manner of terrible creatures and there is ablight upon the land.This blight will soon cross to the human realm - threatening everyone Feyre holds dear.The first half sucksbut keep readingThere's no way around it. From page 1 to about 200, Feyre isannoying and obstinate.I nearly put this book down half a dozen times (it was like readingRed Queen).BUT, there was something about it that kept me interested.AND THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.Because wow. Seriously wow.Midway through the book,things turned around magnificently.It was like a whole new book.Sarah J Maas is a devious little thing.Suddenly, all the plot holes, nonsensical actions of her fairy captors (Tamlin and Lucien) and Feyre's complete idiocy flipped on their heads.Everything makes sense now.I literally could not put this down.Though, and maybe it's just me, butthe Tamlin-Feyre arc felt a bit rushed/forced.Her constant love declarations really had me questioning their relationship. But then again, I had a friend who accidentally spilled the beans on that one.Without giving any spoilers, I sure hope book 2 does acomplete character shifton you-know-who (NOT voldemort) because I amnot pleasedwith the way the love interest was hinted at during the end of the book. (He's such a jerk!)Overall, I amamazedby how much effort Sarah J. Maas put into constructing this story. I'm this close || to rereading the book solely to better appreciate all those little clues that I must have passed over.So, if you pick this up and just aren't feeling it -keep reading- trust me.The Finer Books Club - 2018 Reading Challenge: A book recommended by a friendYouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads",4

What am I supposed to say after this? Am I supposed to write a coherent review with vital points as to why this book WAS FUCKING AMAZING??? I CAN'T EVEN TALK RIGHT NOW I'M SPEECHLESS. I WANT THE SECOND BOOK IN MY HANDS BUT MY ORDER STILL HASN'T COME. I'M READY TO GO TO FUCKING ENGLAND MYSELF AND PURCHASE IT. KIDS I'M LITERALLY DYING HERE.The Beauty and the Beast-esque fantasy drama tells the story of Feyre, who finds herself entwined with faeries after unknowingly killing one. When the 19-year-old huntress kills a wolf in the woods, a beast-like creature arrives to demand retribution for it. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she only knows about from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not an animal, but Tamlin, one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled their world. Feyre must find a way to stop it or doom Tamlin and his world forever.I'm not a fantasy fan. I love fantasy in film and tv but not in books. I picked up this book cause I wanted to use it for my thesis for uni (don't even ask) and now after I graduated I decided to give it a go. My favorite genres to read are historical fiction and contemporary, and fantasy falls on a very different category. But the fantasy in this book man... it gripped me tight and didn't let me go.First I started off this book a bit confused. The language confused me a bit, the terms, all the information. I'm reading books in English while my native language is Greek so fantasy fell a bit harsh on me. As I said, I'm not a fantasy fan, and with fantasy comes many weird words and shit like that. But I kept going and after a while I got used to everything and started to enjoy the plot and the characters. I enjoyed very much the factor that there weren't many characters in this book. I don't like when a book is crowded with characters, it doesn't give me the space to love them all. This book succeeded in making all the characters lovable for me... even Rhysand. I fucking love Rhysand man. Unexpected feelings happening.The worldSarah J. Maascreated is so rich and dark and gloomy but also happy and hopeful and full of light, I truly enjoyed reading about it. I always get bored, to be honest, with descriptions and politics of different worlds but this one excited me. Even the fucking politics were exciting. I want to delve more into this world wHEN MY FUCKING BOOK ARRIVES.Now to the juicy shit... the romance. Holy fucking shit. I ship these two so hard I can't even breathe. When he sent her away I wanted to scream! He gave her a good fucking and left her hanging. Why am I laughing at this? But honestly, the romance was amazing. At first, I felt like the entire book was only gonna be about the romance and I didn't quite enjoy that but after all the revelations and the twists in the plot, the romance was used wisely. And I didn't expect that, because I have heard lots of things about this book. And now we have Rhysand... this dark, handsome motherfucker who has a gloomy past. This will become a triangle, I can feel it in my bones. But I'm here for it, for some reason. I love the heat Maas's romances convey in me.To sum it all up, this book took me a while to get into but it was all worth it. Maybe after this book I will start reading more fantasy. Maybe. Maybe not. As I'm waiting for the sequel to arrive, I will drawn my sorrow into crying about how amazing this first book was. Or maybe reread some parts. Maybe. Anyway, till the next one K BYE!!!",5
67,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)","I approached this book with an open mind and wanted to enjoy it. Despite not being a fan of the superfluous writing style or the lackluster world-building, I was still willing to rate it 3 stars by viewing it as an easy guilty pleasure romance book. The relationship seems harmless and I still don't see how it's as problematic as people dramatize it to be. The first half of the book is a standard Beauty and the Beast retelling — not awful, but not special either — and then the second half really dips in quality, which lowered my rating to 2 stars.A couple glaring issues that stood out to me:1) The background story of the curse is literally told instead of shown via a side character's lengthy monologue. This was disappointing since I was intrigued to find this out by piecing clues together, not by being told it straightforwardly like a regurgitated wikipedia article.2) The main character seems relatively smart but consistently has leaps of logic that are clearly there for the sake of plot. 9 out of 10 times she won't follow the advice of another character.3) The antagonist is SO cartoonish — like mustache-twirling cartoonish. She gives a bunch of arbitrary challenges and rules for no reason other than for the sake of stringing along a story. It feels like she's hosting a game show or some overly complex scavenger hunt. There's no reason why she'd bother setting up any of these superfluous rules. I think this is the worst antagonist I've ever read.I'm willing to overlook the writing style and bland romance, but once I got to the part where Feyre answers the riddle, I had to drop it down to 2 stars because it was so ridiculous and lazy. I've heard that the sequel is much better though, so I am willing to give it another try, just not any time soon haha.",2

It’s still my least favourite in the series. There’s nostalgia involved since this was my first book by Sarah J Maas. I’ve become really familiar with these books now. Or maybe I should say attached.It’s a great Beauty and the Beast retelling. It’s a great setup for the books to come, especially where Feyre is concerned and her character development, which is where Maas excels at.I quite frankly hated how loyal Feyre was to her family, though it’s understandable. But it’s this level of loyalty without any concern for her own well-being that leads to her downfall. Her loyalty to Tamlin when it came to the events that happen towards the end of the book destroy her. It was uncomfortable to read and see Feyre come to this realisation herself.This seems to straddle the line of YA and NA fantasy, which is why I’m assuming the world-building feels so lacklustre, and at times, juvenile. Amarantha read like a spoiled child, though she’s the villain. I just didn’t care for the magic and world-building in this book because of how underdeveloped they felt.Thank the stars this improves leaps and bounds in the sequels. Everything improves drastically in the sequels.",3
69,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)","4.5 starsTamlin is going to set your loins aflame. Phew! My cheeks are still flushed.I'm also fairly confident this book is going to help change the face of new adult fiction. How awesome to see gifted writers shaping non-contemporary stories that have the coming of age/youthful perspective and vibe of YA books and combine that with the freedom that writing for an older target audience affords them. If you liked the mood and romance of (the excellent) CRUEL BEAUTY but perhaps mourned the missed opportunities of such a seductive premise, ACOTAR more than satisfies.BITE MY NECK SOME MORE, SIR.Plus stunning action and gorgeous imagery and interesting characters, including a fascinating anti-hero I'm looking forward to learning more about. Serious Darkling vibes, my friends.Maybe more of a review closer to release. If I can calm my racing pulse before then.",4

I like to enjoy bookswhileI'm reading them, not only for the last 25-35% when everything that was murky throughout the whole book becomes clear.I also found myself WAY more interested in Rhysand than the actual love interest, Tamlin. Whoops!THAT SAID.Ididenjoy the writing and the ending.And while those things aren't enough to prompt me to rate this thing any higher,I AM going to read the second book.I trust my peeps and all of you are saying that, while the first book drags, the second book is ""OMG amazeballs.""

I hate them but this, this master piece is noBeauty and the Beast. I'm just gonna jump right into everything and just a little warning: I'm so sorry if this seems like I'm frantically flapping around on my keyboard, but I'm just that excited.I was so worried that this book would have a plot too close toThrone of Glassand that the characters would also suffer that same fate... But thank the literary gods above that didn't happen. Yes, Maas still gives us swoon worthy gents and a strong leading fem, but they are not at all like the cast ofToG. Our leading lass is Feyre, and man oh man did I love her. I loved that though she is strong she isn't doing it for herself or because that's who she is, she's doing it because it's what needs to be done. This is what made her character for me. She does everything for everyone and expects nothing in return. Her character starts as a strong huntress and turns into something more. She has the head strong will of a warrior and the heart of an artist. I loved that Maas gave her so much depth and let us get so deep into her brain that her feelings become your feelings. As for Feyre's love interest, she gives us the heart twist-swoon worthy-deep-thoughtful-man candy that is Tamlin. Oh Tamlin will have you weak in the knees and have your loins aflame (seriously blushed so much during this book). He literally has so much weight on his shoulders and still stands tall. He is willing to give up everything to make sure she's okay.I kid y'all not I never ever use the word ""ship"" for couples, but as they say there's a first for everything and.... I SHIP THEM!!! I SHIP THEM SO HARD! YOU SEE THAT SPOT OVER THERE IN THE DISTANCE THAT IS THEIR SHIP AND IT IS SAILING!!!Can't stress enough how much I loved their relationship. I love that this book is based around it and its growth. They have such a push and pull. I love that one has everything and one is holding on to anything. How they play off each other is so well written. Also had my brain rocked by how Maas stepped up her sexy game in this book... Because it's like a sauna in there! Whoosh, so good! *Round of applause* .The sub characters like the rest of the story are so well done. Lucien, Tam's best friend, has got to be one of my favorites in this book. His loyalty won me over. Plus he isn't so bad on the eyes if ya get what I mean... At one point I even remember saying ""I don't know who I like more, Teen Wolf or the Sexy Fox with one eye""... Yeah, Maas makes having one eye even sound hot! The evil Queen in this book was the perfect amount of mystery and you will hate her. And then there's Rhysand... There's not much I'll say about him, but what I will say is that even when Maas gives you characters you're supposed to hate, you still end up falling in love with them.“Be glad of your human heart, Feyre. Pity those who don’t feel anything at all.”The plot and world building in this book are so beyond what a lot of other authors would have given us. There are so many vivid details, so many beautifully painted scenes, and so many perfectly peeled layers. I was never once left to question what the world looked like (or characters), and I was thankful for this. Sometimes I do like to fill in the holes with my own ideas but not when it comes to high fantasy reads like this one. The plot is action packed. We have this heavy start to the book, a world building middle, and a jam slammed action packed ending.Because let me tell you when everything comes together and everything is slowly shown you will be tossing your book in the air or punching your kindles in their faces... You will freak out!It's like the end scene toInceptionwhere that heavy DOM DOM music starts playing and the dream is collapsing and everything just falls together for this epic ending! Even the things you know are coming will still rock you to your bones. Maas gives you this heart filled, gut wrenching, wtf ending that I myself couldn't have been happier about. I ate this story up!!!! The plot is just as strong as the characters, and I'm so glad this wasn't a let down. Maas perfectly blends both the YA and NA worlds into this one book. This is a book that will make your heart race and make you want to lose those precise few hours of sleep just to snag a few more chapters... And it'll be worth it too!A Court of Thorns and Roses was the tits.Originally read April 2015Re-read: April 2016July 2022July 2023",5
84,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)","Feyre in Faerieland.In the Mortal Lands, young Feyre accidentally kills a Fae while hunting in the woods to feed her desperately starving family. By Treaty Laws Feyre’s fate is now forfeit and must surrender the remainder of her life to Prythian, the magical Kingdom of the Faeries, where not so long ago, humans were enslaved and killed purely for sport.Finally I can see what all the hype was about! Sadly I cannot say this was one of my personal favorites, but I do think much of the books praising is very well deserved. It takes its time for things to finally start happening, but after a certain point the plot becomes quite engaging and gripping. Superb worldbuilding and character development.For some reason I couldn’t deeply connect with Feyre and that made everything else somewhat lacking. That said, I must say I really enjoyed pretty much most of all of the other characters. Unlikable at first, but changed over time. I specially loved the unfolding relationship with Nesta, and highly enjoyed all the banter with Lucien and Alis; and even Rhys sometimes. The slow burn with Tamlin was amazing; and I must confess the enemy to lover trope always gets my motor running. Not to mention, enemies to friends with almost everyone else lol. I’m left with a plentiful amount of quotes and moments to remember by. Feyre is certainly one tough cookie, and hopefully I can grow to like her more during the rest of the series. Or less?By all accounts, a must read fantasy book. If only to see what all the fuss is about. And I can definitely see it becoming a movie or mini-series sometime soon.-----------------------------------------------PERSONAL NOTE:[2015] [448p] [3.5] [Fantasy] [Almost Fav] [Recommendable] [Distrustful Feyre] [Mighty Tamlin] [Unpredictable Lucien] [Snappy Alis] [Stonehearted Nesta] [Chaotic Good Rhys] [TW: Excessive purring][""Take this knife Feyre.

Por las Leyes del Tratado, el destino de Feyre queda sellado y debe entregar el resto de su vida a Prythian, el mágico Reino de las Hadas, donde no hace mucho los humanos eran esclavizados y asesinados sólo por deporte.¡Finalmente puedo ver de qué se trataba todo el escándalo! Lamentablemente no puedo decir que ésta fue una de mis lecturas favoritas, pero sí creo que muchas de las alabanzas de este libro son muy bien merecidas. Se toma su tiempo para que las cosas finalmente empiecen a suceder, pero alcanzado cierto punto la trama se vuelve muy atractiva y atrapante. Magnífica construcción de mundo y desarrollo de personajes.Por alguna razón no pude conectar profundamente con Feyre y eso hizo que todo lo demás se volviera algo faltante. Dicho eso, debo decir que realmente disfruté mucho de casi todos los demás personajes. Desagradables al principio, pero que cambió con el tiempo. Especialmente amé como se desenvolvió la relación con Nesta, y altamente disfruté casi todas las interacciones con Lucien y Alis; y hasta Rhys a veces. El ardor lento con Tamlin fue espectacular; y debo confesar que el tropo enemigo a amante siempre hace arrancar mi motor. Sin mencionar, enemigos a amigos con casi todos los demás jaja. Me quedo con una abundante cantidad de citas y momentos para el recuerdo. Feyre es ciertamente una galletita dura, y con suerte tal vez pueda llegar a quererla más durante el resto de la serie. ¿O menos?A todas cuentas, una lectura debida de fantasía. Aunque sólo sea para averiguar de qué trata todo el alboroto.

It blew me all the way away and left me wanting more of its glorious world and even mightier characters.note: copyright of all fanart goes to their amazing artists_______________The Land of The FaeSo not only was this my first SJM book but it was also my first book solely based around Fae! (For the hardcore faerie fans out there, I'll send you the address of the rock I've been living under alongside an apology note.) BUT, in my defense I think this was probably the best book to start in order to both understand and learn to love the creatures.Beauty and the Beasthas long been a Disney favourite of mine and the lush scenery as well as the lyrical writing in this novel made me swoon everytime I understood a faint reference and had me at the edge of my seat everytime it diverged from the classic tale.“Beauty didn’t mean anything in the forest.”To be completely honest, the latter 25% of the book was a solid 4 stars for me and the beginning was bordering a 3. This was really down to the fact that I wantedmoreto happen. The pacing felt jolting at times and often I felt the storyline had assets that seemed unnecessary to the higher plot. I disliked that almost everything was revealed during the last 15% of the book. The infodump was overwhelming and I wish it had been spaced out a tad more cleverly.Regardless, I loved the mysterious and wicked atmosphere paired with some fantastic characters and plot twists. Prythian is both dangerous and sultry, from its curses, royalty, and magical beasts. From trusted reviewers and friends, I've been advised that the second book deserves all the stars and more, so I'm definitely reading that next!The CharactersThe characters drove the story for me, at least more than the actual plot. For once in a YA/NA fantasy novel, (this is definitely New Adult but has been advertised as Young Adult which is a controversy in itself) I liked the main heroine! Feyre was like a breath of fresh air. I enjoyed her stubbornness and maturity, I like that she made mistakes but knew where and when she was in the wrong. I also loved that she was portrayed as strong and un-doormaty...Yes, she has her flaws but I'm not going to complain when we finally have a 19-year old hardworking main character that believes in her values and develops through the book.The side characters (Lucien, Rhysand and Alis) stole the show for me. My heart went out for them. I am definitely Team Rhysand but I'll get into that later ;) I felt like the dynamic between the courts and the tension from the ""blight"" was written really well. I followed with the backstory and the history of Prythian throughout the novel and I honestly fell for each character's story arc. Lucien has a heart of gold and Rhysand is a walking, talking stick of ego that somehow has something soft within him. Alis was my own Mrs. Potts, with her charm and blunt personality and I never felt like any of the chapters that they were in were filler chapters. Towards the end, I started getting giddy whenever Rhysand was in a chapter... (Tamlin is very irrelevant to me... but I've got a whole ass section for him coming)“Can faeries be friends with mortals?”“Five hundred years ago, enough faeries were friends with mortals that they went to war on their behalf.”One of the only parts that actually made me tear up slightly was a scene between Nesta (Feyre's sister) and Feyre during the second-half of the story. Nesta seems like she's going to have the biggest character development arc and I am here for it. Lil' cold-hearted ice queen is ready to be thawed out!The RomanceI dislike Tamlin.There are so many reviews that I have read now and posts where people have mocked themselves for liking Tamlin in the beginning and I kinda feel left out. But no. From the minute Feyre was held captive in his manor, there was something about his character that I couldn't settle with. He was unnerving and uncomfortable in his scenes. Some of his dialogue between Feyre and him had me cringing at the lack of chemistry. So, I can't tell you how relieved I was when I felt sparks between Rhysand and Feyre.Throughout the novel, my experience with the romance was dull. It felt forced and alarming at times. Tamlin was also the only character I felt that had no true personality... I wanted to go with the whole ""captor with a heart, knight in shining armor"" vibe that the story was trying to go for but I just felt like this man was taking advantage of the entire situation.He does.“It took me a long while to realize that Rhysand, whether he knew it or not, had effectively kept me from shattering completely.”Don't get me wrong, the situation with Rhysand and Feyre echoes shades of romanticized trickery as well, (I see this as a little bit of a dark romance that hopefully blooms in the next book) but I enjoyed that Feyre stuck to her own during her time Under The Mountain. I was actually quite sad when this book ended because it felt like I finished a journey in this new world. I'm so ready for ACOMAF, it's actually embarrassing at this point.““Why are you here, then?”The man’s remarkable eyes seemed to glow—with enough of a deadly edge that I backed up a step. “Because all the monsters have been let out of their cages tonight, no matter what court they belong to. So I may roam wherever I wish until the dawn.””Pre-reviewyour girl is finally bracing her first SJM book... i was promised that my crops would be thriving, my skin would be clear, my vision would be 20/20 and my heart would be full. i expect nothing less.©",4
88,Happy Place,"➸4.25 stars”in every universe, it’s you for me.even if it’s not me for you.”— alexa, play maroon by taylor swift.can’t believe emily henry had the audacity to write a book about me!! ms emily reached inside my brain and took out parts of my life to write this book, it’s uncanny. i am constantly overwhelmed with how she can take the most deepest inner emotions of a person and articulate it in a way that is so relatable it makes the reader feel seen. i just love how she describes the complexity of adult life!did i finish this book or did this book finish me? even though this book is called“happy place”i’m just here to warn you that this book will not necessarily make youhappy.the audacity of EH to even call it that when this book fucking crushed me to pieces, ripped my heart out of chest, stomped on it 928482 times and then flung it into the ocean. this story explores heavy topics, it’s filled with love and loss, grief, hurt, trauma, change, happiness and unhappiness + friendships and family; this book was more melancholy, thoughtful and deep—this is ultimately why i loved it sm!— this story is narrated by harriet and it is alternated between apastandpresenttimeline, and explores how this tight-knit friend group met and harriet’s life since then. the parallels constantly left me in awe! we also become immersed in wyn and harriet’s past relationship and we are taken back to how they first met and fell in love.the past chapters are shown to be harriet’s “happy place” which is when her time is spent at a cottage in maine — an annual trip she takes with her boyfriend and best friends.”you are in all of my happiest places. you are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”— second chance romance trope is honestly one of my favourite tropes, but only when it’s done well. i need to feel the connection between both characters, what made them fall apart and their journey finding their way back to each other, and i can say this book excelled at that. this book had me feeling all the feels. literally the PINING in this omg and the ANGSTTT and the pain, my poor lil heart couldn’t take it all. wyn and harriet were so torn up over each other, but they are so bad at communicating their vulnerability to one another. the chemistry between them is palpable despite the fact they’re not together anymore.—PSA: this book relies heavily on past miscommunication/lack of communication so if you’re a miscommunication hater like me, be aware. these two are so broken and damaged, i couldn’t hate on it. harriet has a tendency to push everyone away, including wyn; and wyn has a tendency to worry and overthink things—which in time ended up clashing together but it was handled so immaculately, i found it bearable and i just wanted to see them both get their happy ending.↳ harriet is me, i am her. she puts other peoples needs and feelings before her own to keep the peace, the way she has an inability to show others her emotions, especially during the break up bc she fears she will be a burden really hit close to home. her character was frustrating at times, but nonetheless she was so loveable and understandable bc her upbringing and family dynamic affected her as she grew up. she was never taught how to fight with the ones she loves and that took a toll on the way she communicates in relationships. but i just constantly wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and scream “YOU ARE ENOUGH” i love her character sm, it was definitely bc i related to her in an unnerving way *cough*i also hate my job.her love for wyn was devastatingly beautiful, the way she loves and feels is so deep.↳ wyn, wyn, wyn, oh how i love u. when his love language is physical touch 🤭 i died at that. my soul left my body and descended to heaven, not even joking- he’s my baby boy fr. we see his character as very self conscious and never believes in himself, we can see that he feels he is not enough for harriet and his self doubt instincts always take over but he loves HARD. on that topic; i didn’t understand how he can love so hard, but walk away so quickly without fighting for harriet, but it makes sense since they’re so bad at communicating 🥲— ms henry wrote another swoon-worthy character who is deeply flawed but loveable at the same time. i just love the way EH handles mental health topics and always manages to give so much emotional depth to her characters.↳wyn and harriet:— i love both of their characters and i was rooting for them the entire book!! the witty banter and sarcasm between them had me giggling fr. you could feel the connection between them both, they are soulmates!! they both ache for each other and you can feel it all pour out of the pages. harriet and wyn are so different from each other—yet so similar, this is why they instantly connected with one another.— i just love how EH made their conflict realistic and not forced and dragged out. we see them both focus on their self-growth and healing, but seeing harriet go through her self-discovery journey and then finding her way back to wyn has me in my feels rn, it just felt so real. 🥹“i thought i made you […] just by wishing.”↳ the friendships and connections in this book is so strong, but it also tackles how friendships can change over time as adult friendships can become so difficult to maintain as you age with everyone being in different stages in their life. i loved seeing this group navigate through it all, i crave a friendship like what they all have even though it’s dysfunctional and the conflict would be over lack of communication was juvenile but it made it feel so much more real. my main take from this was thatfriendships are love stories too. i just love platonic love!! also, the theme of found family runs so deep in this story, she executed it so perfectly >>>— overall, this book was phenomenal and i absolutely adored it, EH writing is just *chefs kiss* if you’re looking for a romance galore book i’m sorry to say this book isn’t for you, this book explores more about a friend group and their dynamics, growing up and letting go. i will keep saying, HER BOOKS ARE 100% MORE WOMEN’S FICTION, THE ROMANCE IS JUST A PLUS!!— but, i wasn’t a fan of the ending honestly.. it was really rushed and it didn’t fit harriet’s character; the decision she made fr left me shocked lmao. she threw all that away for a hobby, in this economy?? girl- 😳🧍🏻‍♀️──────────────────────────damn, she got me again!!

89,Happy Place,"Buckle up, bitches, because I have some things to say.P.S: if you liked this book, I'm really really really happy for you. I wish that could be me! <3My review may contain some spoilers, you've been warned.I decided to give Emily Henry another chance afterBeach Read,which I did not finish because it was bad in my opinion. So, I said ""Why not? Maybe this one turns out to be pretty good!"" and now that I finished it,I've realized(after a long night of overthinking and self-loathing. Yeah, I know, it wasn't my best night, lol)that maybe romance as a main plot isn't my genre.First of all, I've never ever been in love in my almost 25 years of miserable existence, nor someone has been in love with me, so I don't actually know how it really feels, (that's a deep and traumatic conversation for another day), but to me it's kind of unreal that people can last years and not get bored. Please, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's not a real thing , but I can't even start to imagine someone loving me for so long without getting bored of me.(Plot twist: deep down, I'm a hopeless romantic who yearns to love and be loved for a really long time and to be in a healthy relationship, but that's not gonna happen, so).Basically, Happy Place is about a second chance romance, between Harriet and Wyn (I swear I've never heard the name Wyndham until the day I started this book), who broke up five months ago and reunite for a trip with their best friends. They have to act like they're still together and pretend happiness and such just to not causing chaos.The jump from past to present was not for me. While I enjoy those kind of flashbacks, things were ""interesting"" in the present than in the past.I felt like a fucking third wheel.Or perhaps like I was in the middle of a friend group which I wasn't part of and it made me feel uncomfortable, (I've felt like that in the past, in many friend groups, and it feels awful) and if EH's point was to make me feel like I belonged with them, well, it didn't work out. They didn't even feel like best friends because there was a lot of tension and they were keeping secrets from each other (yes, I know this last thing happens a lot irl).The side characters had no personality whatsoever. They felt very flat and boring. Sabrina was controlling and kind of bitchy. Parth had zero personality. Cleo and Kimmy were okay, until I felt like they were not a lesbian couple, but a heterosexual couple where one of them is a guy with a girl's name. Don't come at me for this, I just felt it like that. Ididenjoy when Sabrina was called out. I get that they were in that trip mourning their youth and trying to have a good time, but goddamn it waspainful.I just could not stand them. Trust me, I'm good at mourning my wasted and non existent youth, but this was pure hell.Wyn was flat and boring. Gods,he had no personalityand it was pretty clear.Even a shoe or a rock has more personality than Wyn Connor.What I hated the most is that basically Harriet was the one making the moves. Always. Man, if you really ""love her"" then go and fucking fight for her. MAKE SOME GODDAMN MOVES TO GET HER BACK AND LOVE HER PROPERLY.And Harriet, girly pop, please, have a little bit more of self-steem and respect for yourself. Stop being a people pleaser and try to save everyone. !I hate miscommunication.I believe it's one of the worst tropes ever and it's used throughout the book. Harriet complains and whines a lot, has a lot of inner monologuesbut she never says shit.Ma'am, please don't expect that everyone knows what the hell do you want if you never say anything. I'm not defending Wyn either, because he did the same thing. And they were constantly lying about how they were happy and okay. Both, Harriet and Wyn made a lot of assumptions instead of actually talk to each other, which could have spared us from a 400 pages book. Things could have solved up faster if they both had spoken first.Like, are you going to tell me that after a long-ass relationship of 8 YEARS, neither of you can communicate things?They could have broken up sooner if they just talked things through. It's like both communication and understanding were missing in the entire book. Also, breaking up with her over the phone? Are you fucking kidding me?This book could have been better if we had Wyn's POV. He obviously was struggling with depression, the loss of his father and his mother being diagnosed with Parkinson. We could have understood him more like this. But otherwise, he seemed indifferent about his relationship.My last straw was... Pottery? Really?Did you just throw so many years of med school, hard work and your residency for pottery? I don't know how things work for med school in the u.s, but, girly pop, I'm pretty sure that isn't cheap, not even when you study in a good school. And holy shit, she’s a neurosurgery resident.(My dream was to become a neurosurgeon, so I was speechless and almost screaming like Regina George in Mean Girls). I'm still speachless and amazed because how are you gonna pay your +$200,000 debts from pottery? Wyn must be a fucking billionare.I also felt nothing, nor empathy, sadness, pity or whatever towardsanyof these characters or their problems and relationships.The sex scene felt... Off. There was ""a lot"" of tension going on between Harriet and Wyn from the beginning, but when the sex scene finally came, it disappeared and felt dull.Anyways, not everything seems bad, lmao.I have this love/hate relationship with EH's writing style. For one side, there are some phrases where you can relate and say ""Same, sis, same."", but for the other side, Emily uses metaphors and stuff like that where is no needed.The only good thing, perhaps?I get the hype over Emily Henry's books, I swear I do, but they never captivate me or make me giggle, kick my feet in the air or feel happy. Maybe there's something wrong with me. Maybe, like I said at the beginning of this review, maybe romance as a main is not for me.I'm not going to include this book in my big hype big lie shelfyetbecause I honestly didn't have many expectations for Happy Place.This is where Emily Henry and I part ways.I guess I have more things to say, but I'll add them when I remember, lmao.",1
90,Happy Place,"I mean... if we are all going to read it....3.5 StarsI know, I know, but before you all come for my head, hear me out.I have never been so conflicted by a book before. I simultaneously really loved and kind of hated this book. Let me start out by saying I think Emily Henry is an absolute poet, she is nothing short of a master at her craft and this book is probably some of her best writing so far. The pacing of this book, the alternating timelines, the character development, the relationships were all beautifully and expertly written. So, you are probably scratching your head thinking, ""Beck, so what was the problem?"" Well........ I just could never buy in to what this whole book is about in the first place, the break-up, let's just call it what it is, this is the miscommunication trope on STEROIDS, ""Oh but it was more complicated than that"" WAS IT THOUGH? And if I am being totally honest, I felt like the ending was not enough payoff for the all the emotional trauma we were all put through.Let me start with the things I loved-The writing- Nobody does it like EH. She is an absolute artist with her words, the way she can summon the perfect measure of every emotion into every page is stunning and so rare. I can't ignore or deny the absolute magic that this author weaves into every page.""It feels like a moment before a car accident, when the tires have started to hydroplane and you know something terrible is likely coming, but there's still a chance the tread will find purchase and you'll never know what agony you narrowly avoided.""The chemistry- The chemistry between all her characters is so balanced and always feels authentic. The way her found family move around each other and interact with each other is so natural and genuine. And the chemistry between Wynn and Harriett was off the charts white hot! You could feel the sparks between them jumping off the page, it was palpable.""Maybe I need to know that he remembers that he hasn't totally forgotten what it feels like to love me, while I'm trapped with him buried onto my heart, my, brain, my lungs, my skin.""Harriet- I really loved Harriet. She is entirely relatable; she is riddled with self-doubt and I appreciated her struggle to please those around her and form herself into what she thought the people she loved needed her to be while sacrificing her own wants and desires. I was thrilled for her when she finally started asserting herself and choosing her own path.""I'm not the brilliant doctor my parents wanted me to be, and I'm not the person who could give Wyn the happiness he deserves, and I'm not the friend Sabrina and Cleo needed.""😭Ok, what didn't work for me:WYNN- Uh oh!! Are you all screaming at me yet? It's not what you think, I DO love Wyn, I think he is sweet and charming and vulnerable, and he absolutely loves Harriett, but the man could not muster up the strength to fight for her even ONCE this entire book!! I kept waiting for him to finally grow and fight for Harriet and it just never happens, even at the end it is HARRIET that moves first, it's always Harriett. I understand when he was struggling before but by the end he is supposed to be in a better place and it's still the same with him. How are we supposed to believe that this relationship will ever last long term, bc things will inevitably get rocky again as do all long-term relationships, but I can't believe that he will ever step up, if Harriet doesn't hold them together it will fail again. Exibit A down below!!!""You can't follow me like I followed you. I won't be enough.""""It'll get easier, he promises hoarsely, his hand brushing my hair behind my ear. ""Someday you'll hardly remember this""See!!! He is literally drowning, and he refuses to kick!!!The Break-Up- More than half of this book is putting us all through this absolute all-consuming agony and heartache for these two people who so obviously deeply love each other and are both completely shattered and heartbroken. The back and forth between the timelines serves to build on this epic love that spans nine years! And the whole time you are thinking, ""What could have possibly happened to tear these two apart?"" And then we finally get there.... and it just didn't math for me. Misunderstandings and miscommunication? A four-minute phone call? REALLY? And then just total and complete acceptance? Naaahhhh. I don't buy it. Sorry not sorry, it's just not believable for me. So, if Sabrina never orchestrated that whole wkend? Then what? They would have just been resigned? It just makes all those beautiful promises that Wyn said to her feel so empty and I think he meant them. Why didn't he come find her when he was feeling better and got clarity. Why didn't she demand an explanation that she absolutely deserved? And this is just some advice THERAPY is your friend! All of this pain could have so easily been avoided.""I have been in love with her since we met, though,""""No,"" he says quietly. ""In every universe, it's you for me. Even if it's not me for you.""""If it was possible to stop loving you, I would have managed it in that first year of desperately trying to. I'm here. For good.""""Do you want me to promise that I will love you forever Harriett? Because I will.""The endingThe woman is a DOCTOR, she could set up a private little practice in Montana and be home for dinner every night. Do you know how much those loans are? Pottery isn't cutting it babe sorry! This wasn't as big of a deal but it did irk me.Ok so even though I did have my issues with this book, obviously, I still really thought it was beautiful. The writing was stunning, and I obviously cared about the story bc this review is a mile long (sorry about that) Will I ever read it again? Hmm doubt it, bc Beach Read is right there.So current EH book rankings:1)Beach Read2)Book Lovers3)Happy Place4)PWMOV",3
91,Happy Place,"the bridge of the archer: “they see right through me, can you see right through me? i see right through me”, encapsulates this book perfectly.the loneliness; the bargaining with the universe; being loved and loving people; the fear of growing up; the fear of the possibility of never being happy; the perpetual struggle between living for yourself and the people you love; the terror of being an unhappy place to the people who love you; the fear of a job or something so permanent in your life being the wrong choice; everything around you changing; the nostalgia for moments you can never get back.harriet and i mirror each other in so many ways, and reading it in words across a book made me feel so seen and comforted.this book is for the girls who worry and worry, worry if they’re good enough, worry if they’ve achieved enough, worry if they’re enough. worry if they love people too much, worry if they love people too little. worry if they’re a catalyst for something bad that happens. worry if they’re too temporary or maybe too permanent. who have nostalgic happy moments on a loop in their heads. who feel the loneliness more with people around them than when they’re alone.⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻this part contains spoilers“stupid, stupid, stupid heart. don’t you know he hasn't been yours to cry over for a long time?”“it’s this feeling like the universe is compacting around me while something in my rib cage is expanding. i’m the culmination of their lost dreams, their missed other lives, and at the same time, they’re proud of me.”“i sit on the edge of the bed, feeling the loneliness swell, not knowing whether it's pressing against me from the outside or growing from within. either way, it's inescapable, my oldest companion.”preface: i rated this book on a completely different scale from emily henry’s other books or romance books in general. the reason why i loved this book so much, was not the romance but harriet’s introspection and character. its tones were much more subtle and nuanced, much reminiscent of a lit fic in some parts.harriet and i are vastly different in personality. she is much more outgoing, warmer, and patient than i am. but our fears and anxieties clicked, which emily henry did such an excellent job of writing about. especially her description of loneliness—i think it might be my favorite part she's written.wyn was an interesting character to me because he seemed so unlike other male protagonists. he feels like alex in a way, but the way his emotions and thoughts are wired is different. weirdly, i still don’t believe that he and harriet fully understand the reason that they broke up or they didn’t work out. they talked about their feelings, but did they truly hear one another? or did their worst fears get in the way of truly unpacking it and instead just tried to bandage it up as quickly as possible to appease one another?wyn’s constant need to feel loved or feel like he matters, and harriet’s constant fear that she will make people around her unhappy—i feel like it will eventually crash and burn again. wyn’s dad dying was a sort of superficial wound because it was an external circumstance/dent in their relationship. harriet quitting her job (although she was unhappy) also feels like a bit of an over-correction and a bandaid to the true problem.but i disregarded almost all of that during my read because of how much they love each other. it’s the first romance book i read where i could palpably feel how much and how desperately they love each other—not in an angsty or sexual way, but just how overwhelmingly they care about each other. and how intrinsically they understand each other (up until the aforementioned part). and also how they try their best to show that love in the way they think the other wants. the way wyn, in flashbacks, always reassures harriet that he will always love her. the way harriet represses all of her immense guilt so she can be the strong one for wyn. small gestures throughout the book that they are always trying to read and understand the other.that made this a very magical read, in a way.⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻this was literally AMAZING.i’ll be rereading again & writing a full review in a bit but all you have to know is that this has book lovers’ banter and beach read’s introspection. not so much a huge rom com like her other books but it’s much more mature and melancholy and UGH there are some passages i teared up at.5/5 for the moment <3thank you berkley for the arc!!⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻pre-readEMILY HENRY I WILL HIBERNATE UNTIL APRIL FOR YOU REALLY I SWEAR IT'S NO PROBLEM DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT",5

EH broke me, i need someone to fix my shattered heart. how am i ever supposed to move on from wyn and harriet 🥲 i want theirlove, i want their respect, i want their passion. i want everything they have. laying in bed wide awake reading the book when i was supposed to go be bed hours ago.. now, do i love or hate that feeling? i certainly wasn't able to put the book down because it was so emotional and i needed closure.second chance romances are one of my favorite tropes. it gives me all the angst and pain that i need for a book. i’m usually not a fan of flashback pov’s but EH justknewhow to do it right, and this feeling of getting closer & closer to the chapter where they’re actually breaking up.. kill me right now. the miscommunication is a big part of this book, which i’m usually not a fan of, but somehow it didn’t bothered me this much here since i wasactuallyable to understand why they acted that way. it was so realistic and this scares the shit out of me.wyn’s and harriet’slove for each other runs so deep and i just connected with them instantly. i felt everything they felt, making me want to jump into the book to just hug them. and the fact that wyn’s love language is physical touch adds even more to the tension >>>harrietmaking bargains with the universe was so fucking relatable. like you think you can promise the universe something and prevent the inevitable but of course you can’t. you can’t, and then you feel helpless and just ugh. i could feelboththeir heartbreak on my tongue and no matter what harriet did, she felt him slipping away and that was the most painful thing to ever read about.“i might always be a little bit in love with wyn connor.”this book isn’t for people who only want to read about romance, it’s also mostly aboutfriendshipand i thought it was such a beautiful aspect in this book. i see myself a lot in those characters, being scared that my friend group will fall apart since everyone is building their own life, going their own way, moving to another city. it is important tounderstandthat not everything will stay the same, that we won’t love the same things we did a couple of years ago and that it’s okay to change. and i think EH did a wonderful job to represent that.“in every universe, it’s you for me.even if it’s not me for you.”—rtc i need to recover first 🤧—update: bye not me thinking this was gonna be a fluff romance, i think my heart will shatter lolbuddy reading withlilyya,raeandvio💗",4
93,Happy Place,"Each year, Emily Henry releases a fantastic novel and I always give my vote for her in the best romance category at Goodreads Choice Awards. In my opinion, nobody can compete with her because she creates the best of the best. She not only plays the strings of my heart but is also a soul whisperer by writing the most unforgettable love stories.After reading this fantastic angsty romance/self-growth/beautiful friendship story, I decided it is my second favorite book by EH. ""Book Lovers"" is still my all-time favorite novel!I have to admit that this book is the sexiest, steamiest novel the author has written. The main reason is that the couple in the story has already known each other for ten years, and even though they broke up, the flame is still there. They are obviously soulmates! But what happened between Harriet and Wyn? They dated for nearly a decade, staying as fiancées for eight years. Why did Wyn end things with a four-minute-long phone call? Was it only long distance, did one of them cheat, or is there any crucial, life-changing reason that tore them apart?Harriet is invited to her Happy Place, where she has spent her most meaningful, unforgettable, sentimental moments with her best friends Sabrina, a hotshot lawyer, and Cleo, an aspiring farmer. Sabrina started dating their long-time friend and party boy Parth, and Cleo is happily farming and dating her hyperactive, extrovert lover Kimmie. Normally, their group turns into a party of five!Even though Harriet broke up with Wyn five months ago, they didn't come clean with their friends. Harriet is adamant about telling them at their special union in Happy Place, but she realizes that Sabrina already invited Wyn to their cottage, and Wyn acts like they're still together.Harriet finds out that Sabrina's father will sell Happy Place, and that this will be their last time together. An era of their lives is about to end. She also gives other shocking news. Harriet is a person who doesn't know how to fight, hates conflicts, and tries to please everyone around her. She doesn't want to create a disturbance by announcing their break-up, and Wyn seems to be on the same page.They should act like a couple for a week, and they will eventually come clean when their holiday is over. How hard could it be to stay in the same room, touching and kissing your ex in front of others when you are still harboring your unresolved feelings?Overall, this is an inspirational novel about self-growth, friendship, growing up, changing, grief, and mental illness. I returned to read some chapters over and over again. Harriet and Wyn might be my favorite couple that EH has created.Millions of thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing 2023's most anticipated book's digital copy with me in exchange for my honest review!If you’re interested in reading my extended book reviews, movie critiques, and hilarious astrology articles, be sure to check out my Medium account using the link below:medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5
94,Happy Place,"i feel like me and this book are somehow cosmically intertwined and our souls are one. this book was so taylor swift’s lover, folklore, midnights coded, tell me i’m wrong ?!there’s this unique connection i get from emily henry’s writing style that at this point should be studied. the way she not only describes feelings but gives me this ache that’s so deep and penetrating. it’s so tender omfgthrough out book we are consistently jumping from past to present timelines. and usually flashbacks bore me to no hell but not these. in fact, at some points i was rather craving the flashbacks more than the present moments.harriet and wyn are such unique characters compared to emily’s other characters. a lot of it is the same i can’t lie, but still, i get attached to them like glue. they feel so deeply and love so intensely. even though this entire book is all in harriet’s pov you still get a full characterization of wyn. and not only that. the side characters, this found family. all these characters have so much personality and depth. ugh i’d take a bullet for all of them fr.harriet is so me coded “he’s a golden boy. i’m a girl whose life has been drawn in shades of gray.” GORL IM CRYINGand wyn omg this sweetheart !! his kindness and selflessness is so precious and infectious. “i will always love you, that’s the point, harriet. it’s the only thing that’s ever come naturally to me.” GAHHHD i need him !!and as always emily henry books are gonna hit a little harder, linger a little closer, and stay a little longer than any other romance book. 1 star off only because i was semi bored in the middle and it felt a little flat in some parts. and the ending was so fucking rushed. i wished it gradually ended. nonetheless i still really enjoyed this book and highly recommend :)emily henry book rankings (this always changes, although beach read will most likely always stay #1)beach read, pwmov, book lovers, happy placewomen: nora, january, harriet, poppymen: gus, alex, charlie, wynthanks berkeley for the arc",4
95,Happy Place,"when this book was first announced — before it had a title, or a cover, or a synopsis, or anything other than a weird beige placeholder and the words BY EMILY HENRY stamped on it — i made a solemn vow.that vow was this:i would trade my firstborn to read this book. i'll locate a baby just to exchange it for this.and now that i have read this book twice and it is now out in the world, i have the following to say:worth it.emily henry is the unparalleled queen of banter and friend groups.does that make me miss the golden age of my life during which she was writing about both and also magic and also realism and also YA? sure. do i think that she is at her very best when she is writing for quirky teens? yeah. do i think her adult romances are often pale comparisons, in terms of their friendships and relationships and character depth and even humor and reality and emotion, to those books? for sure.but i'll take it.especially since there is angst and yearning here and that is really my only romance criteria!!also, anyone who is rating this book low because the Joy and Butterflies and Unicorn Smiles meter isn't turned up to 200%, you're a coward and i challenge you to a duel. romance can contain ranges of emotion, and actually be the better for it! and you're a dork for thinking anything else, even if the genre does have the words ROM and COM in it.but i digress.bottom line: i still believe i founded the emily henry fan club, and i remain a staunch member.",4

104,Happy Place,"I think I can officially say Emily Henry is my favorite author. This wasn't my number one favorite Emily Henry book (hello Beach Read & Book Lovers), but I still REALLY liked it. The friendships, the heartbreak, and how Emily Henry perfectly encapsulates that bitter-sweet feeling of growing up made my heart hurt.The only reason it's 4 stars and not 5 is that it did take me a bit to get into the romance plotline (not knowing the breakup reason for so long frustrated me), and I felt the pacing could be a bit quicker in the middle, but I LOVED the last 100 pages so so so much. As someone who graduated college a few years ago, has felt the sadness of friends moving away and drifting apart, and looked back on my own happy place moments that feel too far in the past, this book HIT.",4
105,Happy Place,"When I die, I want Emily Henry to lower me into my grave so she can let me down one last time. 🙏🏻And before any of you bitches bring up pwmov (IM LOOKING AT U RASA 😑🫵🏻), I have my reasons.I considered giving this 3/5 at one point but the more I think about it the more it makes me rage. I'll have to split this into parts cause I had an issue with almost everything and anything !!! this is the last EH book I'll ever read so if u see me reading any of her new releases, ill fly out to the UK so u can beat the shit out me 🫶🏻let's talk about names for a sec, cause WHERE DOES SHE FIND THESE NAMES?? his name is literally WYNDHAM. Wyndfuckingham. It sounded so yeehaw but it ended up being an English name 🥹. This should've been a sign for me to stop reading it *sighs* I should've known at this point that he'd be a loser. It's almost as if his parents set him up to be a failure.Also his SISTER'S name was Michael ?? For half of the book I thought he was talking about his brother. Parth sounds like the Bengali word for fart so I couldn't take him seriously at all. (I'll have to confirm this with my parents tho).wynis such a pos, you can't convince me this man loved her for a single sec, they were together for almost 10 years and he broke up with her over the phone??? I'm convinced the one and only reason he stayed with her for that long was bc she stroked his tiny, tiny dick and even tinier ego. I really really really tried to like him for the first 150 pages or so BUT PICKING A SIDE TABLE MADE OUT OF SHOE BOXES (thank u for reminding me rasa) FROM THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WAS MY LAST STRAW. You're not only dumb (he failed gen ed math, whatever that means) but you also collect other people's trash? no fucking thank you.""I've worked so fucking hard on myself these last five months, Harriet, and I'm doing well""up until this point I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, I told myself that he was probably as miserable but this was the 4th time he asked if she's happy TOO. Wdym ""too"" ? 😃🔪Also not him acting shady and smiling at his phone for 70% of the book and making her think he already has a girlfriend, just for the big reveal to be that he makes tables for a living 😃 YES TABLES.This man omg, I couldn't deal with his self pity anymore, I needed him stfu for a sec. Yes Wyn, everyone voted for u to be prom king bc they felt bad for u 🥺 BRING BACK TOXIC MASCULINITY I BEG, I don't wanna read about whiny manwhores ever again. Also not his mum putting pics up of him with other girls to ""promote"" him when harriet came over 😭😭 even she thinks he's a loser.Anyways has no one noticed how he distanced himself from her after he met martin? the one time she didn't coddle him when ppl were making him feel insecure? He was clearly waiting for a way out. ALSO, SHE SAID SHE SLEPT WITH SOMEONE AND HE DIDN'T GET JEALOUS or react in any other way ???? His response was ""Look at me, I am yours"", more like ""i am yours to coddle🥺"". I'll stop here even tho I could write a book with all the reasons why I hate this man <3harrietor should I say harry 😃 Harriet *deep sigh* I was rooting for u girl, we were all rooting for u. I tried not to think of her as a doormat even tho she clearly was one bc she was about to become a freaking NEUROSURGEON ! Ofc she had to ruin everything and turn me against her. I didnt buy it for a sec that she hated her job and wanted to quit, I'm 99.9% sure that the pos made her feel insecure for having a better job than him🙄 I refuse REFUSE to believe that she quit her job after 10+ of studying b-because she wanted to pursue pottery? POTTERY? she's not even good at it AND SHE KNOWS IT 🥹""I withdrew. But I'm going to pay back the rest of the loan myself.""HOW HARRIET? HOW EXACTLY WILL YOU PAY BACK +200K OF STUDENT LOANS (with interest btw) EARNING 20K A YEAR 🧍🏻‍♀️pls tell me so I can quit uni too. Honestly, all she needed was therapy and a pet. I had so many good things to say about her at the start but it all got cancelled out by her stupidity. And let's not talk about how wyn flat out told her to not move to Montana for him but she still did 🤣side charactersI was gonna write about each character individually but I'm already sick of it. Her friends were so one dimensional. I knew I'd hate Sabrina from the start, tbf I expected her to announce there'll be a double wedding 😭 so her going behind their backs didn't faze me at all. Her friends’ side story could've been 20 pages long (max) if they just had one single conversation? Like farm girl tell your friends you're pregnant and Sabrina tell them you miss them? what was all that nonsense *rolling my eyes* Side note, parth was such a bad boyfriend. He was with sabrina for 10 years or whatever but got annoyed at her for reacting the way she did and didn't think of finding her after she was gone for the whole day? AND her friends had to tell him what to do. What did I expect from someone named Parth anyways 😃Things this book has ruined for me:1)	My sanity2)	Social media, cause tell me why I thought of wyn the second I saw someone selling their tables on tinder??3)	people 😭 I saw a woman rowing a boat for a man while he was sunbathing and thought ""harriet behaviour""-----------------------------------------------------I’m too lazy to write a review rn 🧍🏻‍♀️ but just know it’s worse than you think it is <3I slept on it but I still can’t process everything that happened 😭 I have so much to say 😩What a shit show 🥱 I don’t even know what to rate itHate rea- I mean buddy reading 🥺💗 (I just know I’m gonna hate it if it’s anything like beach read🤞🏻)",1
106,Happy Place,"EH is a master at creating relationship dynamics that make you believe in them. i have read and rated all of her adult romances 5 stars because of her ability to make me fall in love with her characters and this book is no different.i adored reading harriet and wyns past chapters. they had such an enjoyable connection, which made reading their present day chapters so heartbreaking. their entire journey was one i felt super invested in from the beginning and was rooting for them every step of the way. and i really, really loved how EH wrote harriets feelings about wyn. very poetic. very romantic. i actually think this book has some of EHs better writing!so why is this not getting 5 stars then, you ask? it would have if harriet and wyn were the only focus of the book. but a significant part of the story is about their friend group as well, and the whole drama of “its our last summer and we are growing apart” just wasnt as appealing to me. i understand its necessity for the plot, but it just didnt interest me at all. should have know this book would have been a little different based on the cover featuring six people rather than just the classic two.but all in all, a sweet story and another win for EH.↠4.5 stars",4
107,Happy Place,"2.5/5 stars.br with alayla!!and as alayla would say:sigh.(if you want to read what alaylaactuallysaid (you do), it's right here:sigh.)there are a lot of things i didn’t like about this. my favorite part, to be honest, was emily’s writing. i love her prose and style and her banter is TO DIE FOR.it will always feel like a warm hug from someone you know and haven’t seen in a while and i’m never not going to love it.butttttt that’s pretty much where it ends.(lies there is more that i like at the end)“what didn’t i like,” i heard nobody ask?well, since you asked…harriet.don’t get me wrong, i liked her occasionally. i even related to her occasionally. but it was 400 pages long and when she’s being annoying for 350 of them, “occasionally” doesn’t cut it.maybe my biggest problem with all of it was concerning her:SHES SO HORNY OH MY GOD.why is nobody talking about this 😭 i swear to god every single chapter was her being horny and wanting to literally jump wyn and thinking about jumping wyn and fantasizing about jumping wyn and IT GOT SO OLD HOLY SHIT. there was no tension between them because there wasn’t room after all the lust.and because of this-i didn’t feel the broken love i’m meant to.i was meant to feel all sad and whatever but i didn’t feel whatever loving and amazing relationship they used to have BECAUSE HER INTERNAL MONOLOGUE WAS SOLELY WANTING TO FUCK HIM.i love a slut era as much as the next person but there’s a reason a slut era isn’t about finding love-my eyes were rolling. if that old wives tale about the wind is true, i’d be so blind rn i wouldn’t have been able to finish reading the book.and because of this,when they finally did have sex, i couldn’t have cared less.there was no tension. i was falling asleep because i felt like i’ve already read this 100000000 times in harry’s internal monologue.also all the shit with her being dramatic and assuming shit and whatnot made me want to smash my head into a very solid wall.note:i’ve always liked emily henry because she hasn’t fallen into the traps of other contemporary romance authors of trying to make inside jokes with all the so cute stuff that happens *gag* but unfortunately it started to happen here.first, the eyes. i get it. he has eyes. most of the human population does.and i’m convinced harry has some kind of coke problem we don’t know about because NO ONE SNIFFS THAT MUCH. IT’S NOT HEALTHY. AND I DON’T CARE WHAT HE SMELLS LIKE ESPECIALLY NOT THE 250TH TIME.it was an active ick for me.wyn.look, he’s okay. he’s there. not gonna be there in my memory for long but whatever.in some ways i liked him. but not really anything worth mentioning.he was what this book was: meh.he's the most one-dimensional character in the book.wyn is a sexy lamp.not to mention i feel like from what we got to see if their relationship, it was just a lot of:harry: “i don’t deserve you, blah blah blah”wyn: “i’ll love you forever in every universe, blah blah blah”like that exact situation happened at least 3 times. that’s not a lot, but it’s strange it’s happened thrice.the friend group/friend dramas/all that shit.i’m not sure what sense of surprise or whatever was meant to be here, but it was painfully obvious from the beginning that they all had their own shit going on. i gave sabrina the benefit of the doubt, but god she’s insufferable. i can understand some people needing more control and having that sort of personality quirk - we all have them - but this is an INNATE characteristic in a person andthey either would have run into a problem with it earlier if they had incompatible or clashing personalities for friends, or they would have made different friends.it’s so stupid that it’s happening now. and at the same time, i don’t care.i’m not going to lie i don’t really care about cleo either i barely remember anything about her, butkimmy? loml.someone said (i think ale?) in their review that they felt like they were third wheeling this friend group, like they were doing their own thing and as the reader you didn’t really have a reason to care, and that’s exactly how i feel!!the setting.hear me out. emily henry has previously had wonderful settings to all her novels, very atmospheric and interesting, and this one felt dull in comparison. it was there ofc, but i’m not gonna remember it.the ending.girl, please. i know that harry had problems with her job, but throughout the novel she reaffirmed that though it was hard, she enjoyed her job. THEN WHY IS SHE GIVING IT UP TO MOVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR A RELATIONSHIP THAT MIGHT FALL APART AGAIN BECAUSE THEY CAN’T FUCKING TALK TO EACH OTHER? the math isn’t mathing.also, people can have hobbies and passions that exist outside of making money. that’s a normal healthy thing to do. this is like a larger issue relating to capitalism and triggering my fight or flight but not everything has to be mercenary. that so often ruins passions and it annoys me when so many people do that. why can’t shorty just like pottery??i’m sure i forgot something and i’ll definitely come update this but at the end of it i do still love emily henry as an author and i will continue to read whatever she publishes.i love how she creates stories differently with different plots and that the characters are all different and not carbon copies of each other.and as previously mentioned, i’d propose to her writing style.basically, i’m pretending my signed copy is of book lovers.------i'm leaving this pre-review bc its gorgeous:this acts as my love letter to emily henry, love of my life, so if you’re not emily henry, then please continue on your way-look, emily, my love, i’m sure i will adore this book and everything in it with all my heart just as i have all of your others. i would buy your grocery list. i would adore your grocery list. i would give up the first born child that i’m not planning to have for your grocery list.but girl i’m scared.one of my least favorite tropes is second chance romance. i won’t recover if this book ends up being the reason that we fall out of love. but i have faith in you and my preordered signed hardcover ♥",2
108,Happy Place,"“Love, I think. That’s new. And I’ll never be happy without it again.”So, I spent the last 100 pages or so crying. 😪Emily Henry did the damn thing. That ending was perfection. It was everything this story needed and what I needed.There’s this sense of warmth every time I pick up one of Emily Henry’s books.I can’t figure out whether this is a feeling specific to her books alone or the feeling you get when you are reading a story that’s about to become your favourite.It’s probably a combination of both.Her stories have all felt magical to me.Bar You and Me on Vacation, but we’re not talking about that book.I love how this felt so slice of life. So vulnerable, so intimate and human and ordinary in a way that’s true to real life.I know I’m reading something wonderful when I find myself pausing, taking a moment to sit with the story and reflect on my own life.It was pretty genius to divide this book into two different timelines.The‘Happy Place’chapters felt like I was visiting a really happy andsafeplace, happy moments that these characters experienced where everything felt right in the world.‘Real Life’felt as good as only real life can feel: not enough, bleak, where you find yourself drowning without even realising it, not knowing how you got there and with just enough happy moments felt in between to keep going.Both these timelines allowed us to truly get to know our characters deeply, when life brought out the best in them as well as when life wasn’t working in their favour.This story just brought out so many feelings within me that I can’t really articulate. There was almost a sense of desperation to it. By which I mean that these two characters were searching for something within themselves. Of worth, of love, belonging, to be seen as you are,to just be enoughand Emily Henry dissected and captured all of those uncomfortable emotions so well.There isn’t a thing I would change about it. Wyn and Harry honestly had what dreams are made off. Everything about them two together felt soul-level right. It was a treat to see them fall in love (again).The found family aspect represented belonging in a way that I think we all want to experience, with people who just know and accept you at your core.“You are in all my happiest places. You are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”If, like me, you were doubting a happily ever after, then fear not. I wasfearing. Emily Henry put my feelings through the wringer. Uncalled for but it made that ending so much more worth it. It is a romance, at the end of the day. The most beautiful of love stories.Shoutout to Wyn’s parents. I want them to be my parents. 🥹*Trigger warnings for loss of a parent/depression.*———————————————Do you see this cover? I want to live in it. 🥹Pre-ordered!",5

110,Happy Place,"i really wanted this to be a book i would feel so connected to, and would always stay with me, but it’s not one of those books. don’t get me wrong, the book was painful at times. the writing was absolutely beautiful and some quotes hit meveryhard, but i have many issues with the book that ultimately made it fall a bit short for me.the writing was my favourite thing about this. it was absolutely breathtaking. and i did not feel this way when it came tobook lovers.but in this book it knocked me out a couple times. i felt like she went in my head and articulated my thoughts about certain life experiences and emotions so well.harriet:”I feel like I’m finallythere,that place I’ve always wanted to be, the other side of the lit kitchen windows I could see from my childhood street, where rooms are filled with love and noise and squabbling.”i truly feel connected to harriet. she was such a fleshed out character. beautifully written. she is me and i am her. her love towards her friends, her thoughts about herself, her conflicting emotions towards her family, even down to her thoughts about her job made me feel so seen.wyn:”I think I love you, Harriet.”“I know I love you, Wyn.”to me, wyn was very absent from the book. especially in the “real life” chapters. he’s harriet’s fixation, but i don’t really feel like i know him. despite seeing how they got together, i still didn’t feel connected to his character. i wanted more from him. i enjoyed him more at the beginning when they were younger and everything was fresh between them, but this didn’t translate the whole way through. i get what he was going through at the end, but his character still felt very one dimensional to me.wyn is a sexy lamp.friendships:”The most important friendships in my life all came down to a decision made by strangers, chance.”the only friend i remotely related to was sabrina. the way she was the “problem solver” and the one that always tries to bring everyone together and has this desperate need to keep everything the same. felt. so hard. but that’s it. i didn’t like what she did at the end at all. and the rest of the friends were not it for me. i just didn’t enjoy them.the friend group felt a little bit detached from each other in a way. i was hoping the friendships would feel morereal, but something about them didn’t hit the way they were meant to. they felt very disconnected from one another. i know this was kind of the point, but i didn’t like how it was portrayed at all. i think what was missing in the friendships could have been the humour/comedic connection. for me, i love when found families and friend groups in books make me laugh with them, it helps me see their bond. but they felt like a group of strangers to me. and when they were meant to come back together, it didn’t feel like that much of a reward because i just don’t see the connection between them.romance:”You are in all of my happiest places. You are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”everything harriet felt towards wyn was described so eloquently. her love for wyn was such a real thing. it was pouring out of the pages. i can so confidently tell you that harriet loves wyn. however, i could not say the same for wyn. i shouldn’t need a second pov to feel the love radiating from that character. but wyn felt like he was a wall in this. whenever we got a glimpse into how wyn felt about harry, it almost always felt very generic and there wasn’t anything that special or swoon worthy about it. he was a huge missing piece of the puzzle for me. it felt like this was an unrequited love trope or one person falling out of love, and had it actually been, i would have probably enjoyed it more.conflict:it honestly felt very realistic to me and that’s one thing i loved about it, but it won’t be for everyone. it’s easy to question their decisions and ask “why didn’t they just talk to each other?” but when life gets busy and you get used to this routine, you dismiss a lot of things. you think things are going to get better. you think that if you don’t talk about it, it isn’t real. if you don’t discuss it, maybe, just maybe, everything will go back to normal eventually.this is just a phase. we’ll get back on track.you hold onto that hope. but then it doesn’t. it starts to fall apart. and reading what they went through felt more sad than annoying for me. however, this won’t be the case for everybody.resolution:the ending felt extremely rushed. once we had the full reason for the breakup, i don’t think it was explored enough. things felt so patchy at the end. i think this book had a lot of potential, but i’m not the biggest fan of the way it was executed—hence my conflicting feelings.fav quotes:”Without even trying, I knew exactly where he was at all times, could likely cover my eyes, get spun around, and still point to him on the first try.”“I hate how entangled we still feel on a quantum level. Like my body will never stop trying to find its way back to his.”“Home, I think. That’s new. But it’s not. It’s been growing there for a while, this new room in my heart, this space just for Wyn that I carry with me everywhere I go.”“When he promised to love me forever, I believed him. That was what made me the angriest, with both of us.”“Everything keeps spinning. But my mind’s always got one hand on you.”“His love is steady, constant. Easier than breathing, because breathing is something you can overthink, to the point that you forget how your lungs work and get yourself into a panic. I could never forget how to love Wyn.”“I’ve memorized the rhythm of his breathing when he sleeps and the smell of his skin when he’s been out in the sun.”“In every universe, it’s you for me. Even if it’s not me for you.”“Stupid, stupid, stupid heart. Don’t you know he hasn’t been yours to cry over for a long time?”“I met you, and I finally belonged somewhere again.”“Before I even see him, my heart starts singing its favourite song. You, you, you.”—in honour of this being second chance (one of the greatest tropes if i do say so myself), i’m going to be nice and give emily henry a second chance to blow me away",3
111,Happy Place,"TL;DR: Happy Place felt like an inside joke that I just didn’t understand. I was sitting there feeling awkward and out of place because a friend group I’m not a part of was the main character, not the relationship. It was an overall sad read, focusing on friendships drifting apart, parents getting old/dying, and failed expectations (imposed mainly by self doubt and pressure from friends and family). Maybe it’s cliche to admit, but I truly couldn’t care about 95% of this book. I didn’t buy their HEA. Further, Henry’s writing was way too dense and purple for what was already a heavy read. My happy place was the last page._____Happy Place is very similar to People We Meet on Vacation with the flashbacks and failed relationship that all hinged on a “mysterious” fight. Harriet was wishy washy and was too much of a people pleaser/ problem fixer and Wyn was so self deprecating. The rest of the friends weren’t interesting. They actually just sucked, especially Sabrina.It was more depressing than anything because it was less romance and more the trials and tribulations of being an adult. That shit is sad and not especially romantic. Plus you get flashbacks of Wyn’s very alive and healthy parents and then in the present his dad is dead and mother has Parkinson’s. It was just heavy all around. I’m not saying romances can’t deal with real issues and hard topics, but frankly it just didn’t make for an interesting read and it overshadowed the romance. The phrase “happy place” is basically a trigger for me now because it kept being repeated.As for the steam, the sex was delayed so long I got bored during the actual scene. They kept getting interrupted by people or or “sudden flashes of reality” during the first 80% of the book, which erased the sexual tension… so yeah not fun. It’s a flowery, vague, and short sex scene anyways. Only one scene. The payoff for waiting 9+ hours was the bare minimum.✨**SPOILERS**Further, I simply hated the reason for their breakup. It made me dislike Wyn idc he was too insecure and it being “it wasn’t you it’s me” is just something that I viscerally hate so much. I understand why he broke it off which even made sense and I don’t blame him for that, but the way he went about it was so frustrating and selfish.Wyn made the decision for the relationship without talking to Harriet and never really understood that. He does the same thing in the present too. “You can’t move to Montana because I know you better than you know yourself.” And both times Harriet blames herself!! She’s not blameless but come on girl. Also she wants to be a potter 😭😭? That was so fucking random lmao. Good thing she got scholarships I guess because throwing away your successful brain surgery career is wild behavior.**END OF SPOILERS**✨As for the writing, Henry uses so many adjectives and metaphors that I can’t help but feel claustrophobic. It’s definitely a personal preference but her writing is just so dense. This was my first EH audiobook since Beach Read and I really think it exacerbates the issue. The prose is purple and her metaphors have metaphors.She describes every little detail about every little thing and I got so overwhelmed. The amount of times this man bit his lip, licked his lip, twitched his lip…please god make it stop. My first thought 5% in was “wow, so many words.” So coupled with a boring plot about a group of friends I really didn’t like…it just really wasn’t the book for me.Overall, the audiobook in the PRH audio app kept going back several minutes randomly (idk what was going on) and I could barely tell I was rereading parts. The book just blended together in a big blob of blah. The narration itself was great but couldn’t save a boring book with an HEA I didn’t believe. This will be the last Emily Henry book I read. I gave it a shot because I love the cover and pink is my kryptonite. But no more. My happy place was the last page.⭐️⭐️.25/5 🌶️.5/5P.S. Wyn uses cinnamon toothpaste and clove deodorant which is serial killer behavior.Thanks to PRHaudio for an ALC. All opinions are honest and my own.",2
112,Happy Place,"”You are in all of my happiest places. You are where my mind goes when it needs to be soothed.”Angsty Perfection. Emotional Damage. Hopeful Second Chances.How is it possible to sum up your feelings on a book that you were sure wouldn’t be for you, but ended up being a guaranteed top read of the year instead? Let me explain.I’ve been reviewing books for many years now, and over time I’ve become more jaded with each new release that has an overwhelming hype train behind it. Typically, the pushy nature of READTHISBOOKPLZZZZZ that comes with a huge fan base tends to turn on my rebellious nature and make me want tonotread it or like iteven more. I cannot explain this phenomenon, nor do I defend it, but I have a feeling I’m not the only reviewer who tends to duck and run when hyped books are saturating every bit of your online footprint. Couple that with the fact that I like to try and champion books from either debut authors or without a large marketing budget behind them as often as possible (this is not a pat on the back, just a personal passion of mine), and I do not tend to fit in as many of the big books of the season that I used to. I managed to make it through Emily Henry’s first three releases without caving, but something aboutHappy Placecaused me to rethink my decision, and I’m so grateful that I stopped being a stubborn turd and embraced this emotional journey. (Yes, I am now the proud owner of all four of EmHen’s adult releases.)So how did I come about requesting this book? Well, aside from the FOMO that had built continuously, the marketing of friends-to-lovers-to-enemies really got me, and the fact that this was being paraded as her angstiest book yet (I love a good tummy turmoil romance) sealed the deal. Also, the cover had nothing to do with it. Nope. Not at all. I thought I was getting a fun, summer romance that I’d enjoy, but would ultimately be forgettable in a sea of illustrated covers, but color me surprised when I discovered there was so much more here.”Want is a kind of thief. It’s a door in your heart, and once you know it’s there, you’ll spend your life longing for whatever’s behind it.”I don’t think there are words to describe just how much this book means to me, or how relatable I found aspects of it, but I’ll try to convey here. It’s easy to perceive from the synopsis that this is a story or what was, what is, and what might be. We receive glimpses into the past that build Harry and Wyn’s friendship-turned-romance, and we also receive present tense pov where something has gone horribly wrong, but we’re not quite sure what that is. The tension of building up to that conversation (which actually is brilliantly more than one conversation) is DIVINE, and the havoc that Henry wreaked on my emotions along the way was sinister in the best way possible.Obviously the romance is swoons. The chemistry between Wyn and Harry is palpable, and the payoff after the pining throughout a good bit of the book is worth every bit of anxiety ridden, nail biting suspense. The journey that both characters go on together and individually is satisfying. But also? The dynamic and vibes between this group of six friends is something you can sink into. It’s what you desire if you don’t have it, and appreciate if you do. And it’s not perfect, not by a long shot. Everyone is flawed and has to work at keeping this group together.I also really found myself in Harry’s dynamic with her parents. As someone who, for years, carried a weight of feeling like I would not be enough if I didn’t make the most of my parent’s sacrifices, this aspect of the book, while small, absolutely wrecked me. I was a sobbing mess as I went full circle on this journey with Harriet, and I’m sitting here tearing up again as I write it now.Every single portion of this book is a hard earned happily ever after, which is just the way I like it. Maybe I’m a sellout now, but I’m definitely part of the EmHen fan club now, and I cannot wait to go and read her backlist while painfully waiting for the next book she writes. This book deserves every bit of hype that it has and will receive, and it gives me a glimmer of hope that I can still find that magical feeling of finding a new book that becomes a part of your soul, one that you carry with you on the rest of your journey here on earth and becomes part of your personality on a permanent basis.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.",5

114,Happy Place,"OH MY GOSH!!!!!! The queen, Emily Henry has delivered yet again with an amazing book. I thought Happy Place was going to be a cute, sweet, and fluffy romance, but boy was I wrong. Happy Place written by Emily Henry was such an emotional and heart breaking book. There were so many tears involved, the pain was truly right there. I mean, the title of the book is Happy Place, the cover is so cute and summer vibes, but don't let that fool you, this book was gut wrenching. Despite the painful memories we all have to endure while reading this book, it was so much fun, it was like the whole Goodreads community was doing a giant buddy read. I never wanted this book to end whatsoever, but damn, I loved every single minute of this heartfelt story. I was never once told this book was going to make me sob, so for those of you who haven't read it yet, here's your warning, Happy Place will make you SOB UNCONTROLLABLY. The last few chapters will truly put a dent in your heart, they were so painful, but they definitely gave me the closure I needed. It was like one minute I was giggling, and then the next minute I was gasping for a air, all on the same page. Happy Place was definitely one of my most anticipated 2023 reads. It was PHENOMENAL and absolutely DELIVERED!!!!!!""He's a golden boy. I'm a girl whose life has been drawn in shades of gray. I try not to love him. I really try.""""He can't fathom that all my love for him didn't just vanish, the way his did for me. That it had to go somewhere, and funneling it into anger is how I've managed to make it through these last two days. It makes me feel alone.

Harriet and Wyn were newly weds, but never had a formal wedding. Fast forward a little bit, Harriet and Wyn broke up six months ago and still haven't told their best friends. Harriet and Wyn decide to make a pact to pretend to still be together for their annual week long vacation with their best friends at the cottage in Maine that has been their happy place for so long. Harriet didn't expect to see Wyn at the cottage, but they later learn the cottage they have gone to for years is going up for sale, so Harriet and Wyn decide to lie through their teeth for the best friend's sake of having one last happy week at their happy place. Despite lying, Harriet and Wyn are trying not to notice how desperately they still want one another. Happy Place is told in a past tense and a now timeline. We get a glimpse of Harriet and Wyn when they first met, and how this group of best friends grew up together.Harriet is a people pleaser, she will tell her friends she's doing just fine and dandy when really she's struggling, because she wants to make sure everyone else around her is happy before she is. Harriet is a surgical resident who has lost love with her job, but she won't tell anyone because she doesn't want to let those down around her who have supported her for years. Harriet's parents sacrificed so much for her to be a surgeon, but when she doesn't find happiness waking up early and going to work, Harriet feels like telling her family and friends will drive them away from her. Wyn is a golden charmer who is dealing with the loss of his father. I absolutely loved hearing how Harriet and Wyn met, but it broke my heart when they were telling their story of why they broke up because they felt like they weren't good enough for each other, but they really never had a chance to sit down and talk about their issues, so the week long vacation at the cottage gave them plenty of time to talk to each other while playing their parts of the happy couple. I often find myself connecting on a personal level with Harriet, and making sure those around me are the happiest before myself.Knowing this is their last year at the cottage, Harriet and Wyn can't stand to break their best friend's hearts, so they decide to play their part of being the happy couple who has their who lives figured out. Harriet will be the surgical resident who never starts a fight with anyone, and Wyn will be the laid back charmer who never lets his cracks show. I loved this book more than anything, it felt like I was at the cottage in Maine with this group of best friends trying to figure out the true definition of what a best friend is. I will admit it was a little confusing when the story went back in time because you never really knew when and where they were, if that makes any sense. This group of friends was so wholesome, they fought like everyone does, but they never held grudges, they welcomed you with open arms, it was just so dang sweet. I can't recommend this book enough, if you love Emily Henry, you're definitely going to love love love Happy Place. I can't believe I finished this book already, but I don't think i'm ready for all the pain it brought on. Once again, don't let the cover and title fool you, this book will definitely destroy your heart.",5
115,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"5/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”This book is phenomenal. This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It's a pure 5 star for me. I'm irrevocably astonished and astounded. I want to hug and kiss this book till I bleed. I couldn't leave it down. I just couldn't.Storytime. It's12:36am, I have to wake up in 7 hours or so and I'm casually reading this book. I'm on page233, 50 pages after it got amazingly good for me. And then this line makes its fucking appearance.""I have no idea that in less than a week, Evelyn Hugo will finish her story, and I'll find out what this has all been about, and I will hate her so much that I'll be truly afraid I might kill her.""LIKE??? AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK.And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn't survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let's talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, theOutlanderandRoss Poldarkkind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me.I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn't quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I'm into the book 100%, ready to knowEVERYTHINGaboutEVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren't any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn't have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn't a character to me. She is a person. With influences fromMerilyn MonroeandElizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn't actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can't help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn't ashamed about it. She doesn't give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one.Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn't care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn't let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn't achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn's story started, we didn't get much of her. But I'm so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I'm really proud of her.THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can't entail good representation.IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it's a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn't have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn's life is so engaging and complicated, you can't get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It's more about talent, at the most part. I'd like to hope so.In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I'm gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation.WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I'm scared they would ruin it. I'm always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn't recommend this enough. It doesn't matter if you don't read historical fiction or adult,PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won't regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!",5
116,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"”Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.”This book was so, so, soGOOD!!I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I’d love it with all my heart! <3 There’s just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told!We didn’t only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean “Hollywood Digest”, “Sub Rosa” or the “New York Tribune”, they all wrote about Evelyn’s life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich.I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn’s character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn’t come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It’s a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out.Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn’t manage to sort out my feelings and I still don’t know what to do with them. Maybe I’ll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there’s no such thing as making peace with an ending like that.And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid’s plan all along. ;-)The characters:Welcome to my characters section, aka “The spoilery spoiler zone”! If you didn’t read the book yet and still want to be surprised by its revelations you better don’t continue to read my review. I’m worse than any tabloid mentioned in this book and I’ll spoil you relentlessly! If you still want to read my gossip, go ahead, but don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-PEvelyn Hugo:”And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.”Oh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can’t even! <333 It’s so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh,WHAT. A. WOMAN!I think I might be in love with her! <333”Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.””I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.””I regret every second I didn’t spend with her. I regret every stupid thing I did that caused her an ounce of pain. I should have chased her down the street the day she left me. I should have begged her to stay. I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, ‘I’m in love with Celia St. James!’ and let them crucify me for it.”Celia St. James:”I really like you. I like watching you on-screen. I like how the moment you show up in a scene, I can’t look at anything else. I like the way your skin is too dark for your blond hair, the way the two shouldn’t go together and yet seem so natural on you. And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.”Now here’s the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn’s life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but – and here comes the hugeBUT– I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don’t know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn’t like that Celia wasn’t only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You’d think a person who represents the “L” in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn’s life and that made me really sad. =(”That was how it was with Celia. When you denied her what she wanted, when you hurt her, she made sure you hurt, too.””So I told myself that the spark between Celia and me was just a quirk we had. Which was convincing as long as it remained quirky.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”Harry Cameron:”I want to be with someone I love. I want to have a companion. I’d like to bring someone home to my family. I don’t want to live alone anymore. And I want a son or a daughter. We could have that together. I can’t give you everything. I know that. But I want to raise a family, and I’d love to raise one with you.”Aside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron wastruly the best thingabout this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he’s an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry’s grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_TMonique Grant:”Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn’t like it to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?”To say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique’s character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn’t dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father’s death was necessary to find her happiness and I’m convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*”I’m Evelyn.” She reaches out and takes my hand, shaking it. It strikes me as a unique form of power to say your own name when you know that everyone in the room, everyone in the world, already knows it.””I insist that you be ruthless in your negotiating, Monique. Make them pay you what they would pay a white man. And then, once you’ve done that, every penny from it will be yours.”The relationships & ships:Evelyn & Celia:”I wanted to give her a lot of things. I wanted what I had to be hers. I wondered if this was what it felt like to love someone.”Those two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn’t let them and wouldn’t have understood, because they didn’t want the same thing, because they weren’t ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because… justBECAUSE!There was always another reason why they couldn’t be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn’s outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn’s sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic… more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T”Evelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.”Evelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, “Celia St. James.”The room is quiet as Evelyn lets herself hear her own words. And then she smiles, a bright, wide, deeply sincere smile. She starts laughing to herself and then refocuses on me. “I feel like I spent my entire life loving her.””It’s not wrong,” Celia said. “It shouldn’t be wrong, to love you. How can it be wrong?”“It’s not wrong, sweetheart. It’s not,” I said. “They’re wrong.””If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything,” she said. “And we have always loved each other so much, more than I ever thought I could be loved, more than I ever thought I could love. So why … why couldn’t we overcome it?”“We did,” I said, turning towards her. “We’re here.”She shook her head. “But the years,” she said.”There’s a difference between sexuality and sex. I used sex to get what I wanted. Sex is just an act. Sexuality is a sincere expression of desire and pleasure. That I always kept for Celia.”Evelyn & Harry:”You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”So I fell down.And Harry caught me.Their friendship was everything, absolutelyE.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.!!!Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can’t even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other’s mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It’s so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that… ARGH! I justLOVEDthem!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I’m incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs*”I promise I’ll do whatever I can. I promise you we will figure this out.”“OK,” Harry said, and then he squeezed my hand back and walked out the door. “We will figure this out.””I want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.” I grabbed his hand tighter. “But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it’s time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.”The bi rep:”It really makes you think, doesn’t it? That people were so eager to believe we were swapping spouses but would have been scandalized to know we were monogamous and queer?”And now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I’ll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn’t even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I’m inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn’t accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333”Being bisexual didn’t make me disloyal,” Evelyn says. “One has nothing to do with the other. Nor did it mean that Celia could only fulfil half my needs.””I hated being called a lesbian. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with loving a woman, mind you. No, I’d come to terms with that a long time ago. But Celia only saw things in black and white. She liked women and only women. And I liked her. And so she often denied the rest of me.””Wow,” he said. “Incredible. I married a dyke.”“Stop saying that,” I said.“Evelyn, if you have sex with women, you are a lesbian. Don’t be a self-hating lesbian. That’s not… that’s not becoming.”My conclusion:The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I’m convinced everyone who reads“The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo”will learn something good from it! I’m usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don’t hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charmingAshleyfor this wonderful buddy read! We both didn’t have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I’m glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we’ll find another book to buddy read again! =)",5
117,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"This review contains a spoiler for a reveal around 100 pages into the novel. I knew this reveal going in and do not believe knowing this reveal hurts the reading experience.I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've decided that's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful.And there is something so woefully romantic to me about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others.So that's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.“Make them pay you as much as they would a white man.”The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her.But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn.Awful, complicated, completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I’m not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She issucha good character.This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and Ilovethat. Evelyn’s story is one of being a woman in a man’s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman’s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices wereright.Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don’t… I don’t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but… well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn’s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always.“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”And perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.“You didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up, either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasonswhywe don't want to give. It shouldn't just bethatwe don't want to give up. And I don't... have any.“You have never felt like my other half.”I know I’ve talked about a lot of specific things in the book, but I don’t know exactly how to put into words what this bookmeantto me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reidfeltthis book.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoleft me an emotional mess, but also ahappymess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book, and I want you to be as well.Blog|Goodreads|Twitter|Youtube",5

Divorce is a piece of paper.Evelyn Hugo was the star of the century.She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Every man wanted her and every woman wanted to be her.Perhaps most famously, Evelyn Hugo wasmarried seven times.Each divorce only increased her fame.Rumors swept through the tabloids like wildfire.I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.And now, age 79, Evelyn Hugo decided to auction off her mostwildly famous gownsand offered one lucky journalist (Monique) an interview that will last a lifetime.However, Monique soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the mostscandalous and salaciousthing that has ever graced this world.Monique would be a fool - an absolute fool - to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.Overall, this one was good but I was never wowed.Everyone and their mother was talking up this book and while I agree that it is engaging and scandalous (in a good way)...I don't know.I just expected more from it.I definitely think it was well-written...just a bit dull in areas.We start the book with 40 pages of just talking up Evelyn Hugo and it really did drag. There's only so many times I can hear about howwonderful and stunninga person is before it gets boring.I think if more of the marriages were teased in the beginning - just to give the audience a taste of the mystery surrounding her love life (rather than going on and on about how intriguing it was...without telling us what was intriguing about it) would have helped significantly.Once we got to her life, the book certainly picked up.I really lovedhow Evelyn's sexuality was portrayedin this book. I liked watching her grow as a person - from a teenager using sex to get herself out of a hellhole to falling in love and finding it something to be cherished.Her love forCeliathroughout the years truly made thiswildly unbelievable story cinchfor me. Honestly,her relationship with CeliaTheir love was expertly done, with all of the fear and paranoia associated with the times, that it truly felt like real life.Ultimately, this was an enjoyable read, a bit slow paced, but enjoyable nonetheless!Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads",4
119,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"WOW I NEVER POSTED THIS. What a pleasant surprise! After dozens of unposted-unwritten reviews, finally an unposted-but-written one. Life is beautiful.But first off (I can call this first off if I freaking want to!!!) I wanna say: DON’T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT HISTORICAL FICTION CAN’T BE DIVERSE. Tell that anthropomorphized tennis ball they’re either uncreative or a secret bigot or a full-on dunce or ALL THREE. Because this book pulls it off with more than a tablespoon of grace, I’ll tell you that.My guy, there aren’t even that many characters in this book. And we’re following the majority of them starting in the 1950s. Not exactly, y’know, the peak of support for diversity in America. AND STILL WE DON’T LACK FOR REPRESENTATION. Do you get how great that is? I’m ready to punch the whitesplainers of Disney’s Frozen in their boring pale faces. The word “Frozen” is actually a reference to the lack of movement in the creativity centers of their brains. (Follow for more behind the scenes Disney-Pixar facts.)This book includes three (three!) interracial relationships. Actually, it’s more like ten if you count the fact that our protagonist is Latina. Yes! This may be the bare minimum, but I’m so used to YA wherein one pale as snow teen romances a - gasp - pale aspaperteen! Diversity in young adult books = one character is of Western European descent and the other Eastern European. Talk about a vanilla romance. (Buh dum ch.)This book proves how important it is to provide diversity. The difference in the believability and intricacy of the story is incredible.I will say we don’t often get a good look at the variance in culture that comes with diversity here. Evelyn Hugo, though the daughter of Cuban immigrants, purposefully represses her heritage in order to fit in with the whitewashed 1950s and ’60s cinema scene. Our narrator, though half-black, expresses a fear that someone will tell her she’s “not black enough.” I wish the ethnic diversity played a little more into the text, but it didn’t feel unrealistic or anything. The reasoning was explained.But there’s even more diversity. Like, it gets even better. Because, again, despite the time setting, this book contains A SH*T TON of LGBT+ rep. And these are some of the most beautifully portrayed LGBT+ relationships I’ve ever read. If you don’t read this book for anything else, read it for that fine-ass inclusion, boi.Beyond that, this is the ultimate guilty pleasure book. IT IS SO FUN READING ABOUT OLD HOLLYWOOD AND OLD MOVIES. I wanted to watch the entire Evelyn Hugo canon after this, and then it was like, oh wait, she’s not real.I don’t have much else to say. This is chick-lit-y historical fiction at its finest. It’s just so fun. Some people say they got bored halfway through, and I get why you could, but I didn’t. I really fell in love with the world of this book, and the depiction of Old Hollywood, and all that jazz.A lot is revealed over the course of the book, and the best part is just being surprised at each twist and turn, so I don’t want to go to specifics even a little. I’m just going to cut off this review here before I risk, like, accidentally mentioning that Evelyn Hugo’s third husband turned her into a vampire and she was a vampire the whole time and she turns Monique at the end of the book.*Damn it!Bottom line: This is very fun and cool and maybe even important. Read it!!!*This isn’t true, by the way. Duh.----------------------rereading updateswas tempted to spend my whole day watching old movies and not reading at all.compromised by rereading this instead.this was a very good plan.----------------------pre-reviewThis book? It's really great.I got a hell of a lot more than I bargained for.",4
120,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"Is Evelyn Hugo going to tell me just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat but never enough to truly reveal anything?I can't say for sure what drew me to this book. It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, and I haven't read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters, I figured, because I probably wouldn't like it anyway.And I was HOOKED.It's perfect, easy beach read material. It's not particularly deep, it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new, and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo's story was sodelicious and compellingthat it stood out, and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands, and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?The framing of the story reminded me a lot ofThe Thirteenth Tale. Like that book, inThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. UnlikeThe Thirteenth Tale, this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye, but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout, we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?The more I got to know Evelyn, the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career, but she knows it and she also knows she'd probably do it all again. She's played the Hollywood game, dated famous men to further her career, and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry's sexism and, in some ways, capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame, more roles, more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that didn't like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied.Despite everything - and because of it - I liked her.I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique, through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness, right until the ending's final reveals.I enjoyed every moment.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube",4
121,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"This right here. This is why I read. For the joy and privilege of coming across an exquisite story like this and being swept up in its magic.CouldThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoreally be fiction, dreamt up entirely in Taylor Jenkins Reid's mind? Every moment felt so real, so tangible. When I reached the end, it was hard to let go, hard to return to a world where this was nothing more than a figment of the imagination.Evelyn Hugo, revered Hollywood actress and icon, is finally ready to tell the story of her life. But she wants to make sure that whatever comes out is authentic to who she is. So she contacts Monique Grant, a mostly unknown writer, to be her scribe. Everyone is surprised by the choice, no one more so than Monique herself. But to be given the chance to write Evelyn's memoir and to understand the person behind the legend is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, one that Monique can't pass up.When I first started this, I thought I was in for a fluffy, gossipy romance set in the golden Hollywood era. After all, why would anyone need so many husbands unless one was in it for a good time? But this turned out to be so much more. At its heart, it's a stunning and brutally honest portrayal of love in all its different forms. It shows not just the joy of love, but also its sacrifices and heartbreaks.I was blown away by how complex of a character Evelyn Hugo is. She is the heart and soul of this story, and her character shines so bright, it's hard to look away. She feels real, coming off the pages wholly formed. She's not perfect. In fact, her flaws and numerous questionable actions make her human, and it's easy to relate to her and cheer for her.The book is written in alternative viewpoints, a little bit from Monique's perspective as she interviews Evelyn and a lot from Evelyn's perspective as she shares the story of her life. When a book has two different viewpoints, there's always a fear that one is more interesting than the other. But not here. I can honestly say that every moment of this book was equally riveting.I adored Reid's writing style. It's filled with so much charm that it just oozes off the pages. The story obviously tackles serious issues, but the writing never takes itself too seriously. It's witty and funny, drawing me in and making me feel every emotion. It manages to convey so much nuance without ever slowing down the pacing or seeming long-winded. I'm in awe.You guys know I'm a romantic through and through. And this story is all about finding and holding on to that great love of your life, no matter what it takes. I mean, how could I not be drawn to that? I'm also a realist and I know that love takes so much sacrifice. So this story spoke to my heart and my mind.I never really had a chance. This book had me good and hooked, right from the first page. It's the sort of story I know I'll come back to again and again, savoring it anew every time.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Carrie Soto Is BackDaisy Jones & The SixMalibu Rising~~~~~~~~~~~~This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

122,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"Best rereading choice for flashback Saturday is re-devouring my all time favorite TJR book!Evelyn Hugo a. k. a. Evelyn Elena Herrera is one of the most portrayed characters, a daughter of Cuban immigrants, raised in poverty. She’s not only beautiful, alluring but there’s something different about her: her energy is vivid, radiating. She knows what she wants for her life and she’s competitive and determined enough how she may get it by leaving her life in Hell’s Kitchen and moving to Los Angeles to become one of the movie stars, dying her hair, exposing her slender body, looking directly at the camera with her almond shaped eyes under her long lashes till the director tells her “cut”.Now she’s 79, married SEVEN TIMES, a Hollywood legend, ready to share her life story and scandalous secret she kept for years. She befriends 35 years old Monique Grant, an unknown reporter works for “Vivant” in Los Angeles. Even the boss of Monique has no clue why this Hollywood legend demanded to work with her: she could choose someone more experienced, popular, known in the industry.So many question balloons start to fly above our heads:- Why Evelyn wants to talk only Monique and if she doesn’t, the memoir deal will be off?- Why Evelyn married seven times. Did she love any of her husbands? Does she have resentments? Does she suffer from heartbreak? Which one of is the love of her life?-As soon as their interview starts, Evelyn takes her an adventurous train ride with full of juicy, entertaining, heartbreaking, emotional stories starting from glamorous 60’s of La La Land, the productions of her famous movies, how her path crossed with those men, how she saved them and they saved her, how she got hurt, how she shone, how she burned… and eventually a big secret reveals about her life story which will change everything about true identity of Evelyn and the life choices she’s made!It’s brilliant! It’s unputdownable, addictive, heartfelt time travel in Hollywood. Author’s genuine approach to LGBTQ was better reflected than Ryan Murphy’s Hollywood limited series on Netflix.If you haven’t read it, don’t miss out this masterpiece and the best of the best Taylor Jenkins Reid book ( I liked it even more than Daisy Jones and the six)My favorite quotes:“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don’t do that.”“You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until somewhat stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”“Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”""Do you understand what I'm telling you? When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.”“…do yourself a favor and learn to grab life by the balls, dear. Don’t be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.”",5
123,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"this didn't work for me, but i get how it could work for othersthere's something so glamorous and sad about the golden age of film. throw in a cuban bisexual main character who has to hide her identities and it's a sure fire way to get people intrigued. and i was, throughout the entirety of the book. this book did not lack in keeping my interest.but there were too many things i had issue with. and if i hadn't read all but one of TJR's previous works i might have been able to overlook it. but once i notice a pattern it tends to color my judgment of an author's work.2 big things for me: writing & relationshipsfirst, i knew going into this that TJR's writing does not work for me. it's not hard to digest which is nice. but the writing is so clear and no frills that it's odd when we get these little nuggets of prescriptive morality. she doesn't want the reader to form their own opinions, she's rather just hold your hand to the ""point."" which happens in almost all of her books. makes for a super quotable book, but for me it felt forced at times.and then the relationships. that was 99% of my issue with this book. it wasn't that Evelyn was a wholly unlikable character, it was her relationship with Celia that grated on my last nerve. again, this is something that is a recurring theme in TJR's book and honestly i hope to god this is not something she has intimate knowledge of. but it seems like the only way she can write relationship problems is by making the love interest awful. they have to have blow out fights, say things they could never take back/should have never been said, leave each other etc.and i'm not saying that this doesn't happen in real life. but after the first time this kind of thing happens, i could like to see the characters grow and learn how to cope like adults. because i'm only 24 and evenidon't pull those kinds of stunts with my boyfriend. cause i'm not 16 anymore.and this issue was particularly egregious to me because yes sure the time period was hostile to F/F relationships. but when you have a veritable shit load of money you can cover things up. that wasn't the issue. these two were just too pigheaded to make things work. so. so. irritating.lastlythere is a plot twist that occurs that the end of the book that i really did not appreciate. the twist itself was not bad but given the main character's identity in relation to a deceased person's identity i was honestly appalled. you would think a POC understands POC struggles and wouldn't frame a fellow POC but what do i know.it was just a detail that really rubbed me the wrong way.all that being saidit was really refreshing to see exploration into a time period, culture, and sexuality that is not often explored. i know some people really identify with these characters and i'm glad this book exists. it just did not work for me.",2
124,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"This is genuinely one of the most remarkable novels I have ever read. It is a favorite of the year, it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted byThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoand I will never forget how much I adore this book.CW: domestic abuse, death/grief, homophobia/biphobia, racismabortion & suicideAdult fiction is not typically my cup of tea, especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being, but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful, vivid, and descriptive. There isn’t a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging – it was a huge struggle to put the book down.Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating, especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will, her independence, her strength, her cunning, and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.Personally, I didn’t LOVE Monique, though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of it’s strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story, but it’s for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn, I just did not care for Monique’s individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life, but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn. Edit 4/3/2019 - After a second read, I GREATLY appreciate Monique. Her character is so nuanced and necessary to the story. I totally relinquish much of my initial feelings on her.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME. I will never forget how in love I am with this story and all the ways it has affected me. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone who is interested in spectacular fiction novels (which should be all of you.)",5
125,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"Wow! This book came in and knocked me off my feet.Monique is working for Vivant, a media company, when she is requested to interview Evelyn Hugo, a very famous movie actress, who has refused to give interviews for years. Evelyn starts to reveal her story to Monique, that life isn't perfect, that people are more than just one thing, that relationships are complicated, the power of forgiveness and reinvention, the idea of family, loss, and accepting the choices of others.This book had such depth and tackled so many issues. One of them was the concept of divorce. Growing up in a Baptist church, divorce was viewed as the ultimate sin. As soon as anyone heard that someone was divorced, they had a permanent scarlet letter attached to them. However, as I matured, life isn't nearly as black and white. Do you really know what happened? Did the man beat this woman and then run off with all of the money, just to teach her a lesson? Why does society still think it is OK to stigmatize divorced people?There were a tremendous amounts of very quotable quotes, and this was one of those rare books that you hope never has to end.""There are people who see a beautiful flower and rush over to pick it.""This book also tackled some of the issues that women face. ""Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn't know her power, but I'm sick of all that."" ""People don't find it very sympathetic or enduring, a woman who puts herself first.""Overall, this is definitely one of the best books that I have ever read.2024 Reading ScheduleJan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",5
126,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"At least I know why Evelyn recruited Monique, the worst journalist of the year, to write her biography. I thought asking astute questions was a part of interviewing a famous person. Apparently not.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois a quintessential beach read. The prose is very readable, the plot soapy. You borrow the juiciest, gossipiest parts of Elizabeth Taylor's orMarilyn Monroe's love lives - you get a cracktastick pulp read. It reminded me of the family sagas of the yore, kind of likeThe Thorn Birds. Only this book needed another 300 pages to dig deeper into the dramas of Evelyn's life and her psyche. I was entertained by the events of Hugo's Hollywood adventures, but ultimately this book lacks depth. Nobody else noticed how superficial everything is in this novel - relationships, emotions, portrayals of race and queerness?The novel is framed as a biography written by a talented up-and-coming jornalist, but reads as if thrown together by an employee of a gossip rag, who included all of the salacious parts of a famous person's life, but none of that person's interiority.Totally see why it's a bestseller. It entertains but never challenges.",3

Not only is the story incredibly diverse despite its Old Hollywood setting, it also has the best bi representation I've ever seen. The journey through Evelyn Hugo's life is filled with trials and tribulations, love and loss, mistakes and redemption; all the while, Reid does a great job at making you feel all the emotions along the way. I left this book feeling reflective, melancholic, and touched by how many things can happen in life that are both awful and wonderful.

140,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"i’ve found my new favorite book.heart wrenching, soul crushing, this book ended mei knew i was going to love this. i just had to push myself to pick it up. if you haven’t read this book yet, what are you doing with your life. start it now, without knowing anything. because that’s what i did and now i’m sitting here in bed thinking i will never find a book that‘ll make me feel this way again.evelyn‘sstory is so interesting & intriguing. i was reading this book all day long, unable to put it down and when i had to, all i thought about was when i could continue reading it. reading about her schemes and deceives.. just incredible. i was so invested, rooting for her and just fell in love with her like every other person in this book.evelyn‘s &harry‘sfriendship is all i need in life. i want that mutual understanding of each other, knowing what the other means by glances only, helping & being there whenever the other needs you. their friendship is so pure and genuine, i just want to hug them.“it’s me and you.”“me and you, true blue.”“it’s ok, you can fall down now. i’ll catch you.”“i am absolutely positive that i need you morethan i’ve ever needed another living soul.”tjr makes me feel like i know these characters, as if they were real and this story is true. i think it’s mainly because we read about evelyn’slifestory and not just a small part of it. we see and feel it all, which makes this book feel so real. i can’t say much more about the characters without spoilering too much so the next part is going to be full of spoilers. don’t read any further if you haven’t read the book and are still planning to.spoilerswhen i read the line “i did not speak to celia for five years after that” my heart broke and bled for them. i was so shocked, i seriously thought they were gonna make up right after their fight. i mean i already was heartbroken the entire time since they couldn’t be who they wanted to be in front of the world, but them losing contact and being alone all over again? my heartbleddon’t even get me started on the part when john was dying and harry had to live without him and then him finding a new love and then died 😭 harry dying was one of the saddest parts in the book. i knew it was coming up but i didn’t expect it to be in an accident. and then the reveal of why monique was chosen for evelyn‘s biography? tjr, you are a genius. seriously. from that moment on my heart wouldn’t stop bleeding. everything that came after was just as heart shattering as harry‘s death. once celia died, i just felt so sad for evelyn. i wanted to hug her even if she had despised me for that. i felt her loneliness through the lines and my eyes wouldn’t stop tearing up.i just wanted them to be a big happy family. when celia and evelyn would stop talking to each other through the years, it made me so emotional.. especially when celia was talking to evelyn through her oscar speech 😭“and to anyone tempted to kiss the tv tonight,please don’t chip your tooth.”crying sobbing throwing up banging my head against the table, why can’t they just be happy, let them be happy, please please PLEASE, i need this more than oxygen.“i can’t live with my heart half-broken all the time.”“i should have chased her down the street the day she left me. i should have begged her to stay. i should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the hollywood sign and shouted, 'i'm in love with celia st. james!' and let them crucify me for it.”“you could have been a teacher. i could have been a nurse. we could have made it easier on ourselves that way.” i could feel celia shaking her head next to me. “but that’s not who we are, that’s not who we have ever been or could ever be.”“all i’ve ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. but you’ve never been mine. not really. i’ve always had to settle for one piece of you. but i can’t do it. i can’t do it, evelyn.”god i’m just so emotional rn, i really need ten business days to recover if i can recover at all. this book will for sure leave a mark.”we didn’t have enough time.”",5
141,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"Well I never thought I'd see the day where I didn't fall in love with a TJR book but here we are. I'm sure I'll be the black sheep on this and I'll never understand why. I hated this book and I say that very, very infrequently. I hated every single character with the exception of maybe one but even he turned out to be a huge disappointment eventually. The plot was both simplistic yet beyond difficult to believe. Contrived and cookie cutter are also words that come to mind and will only make sense if you read it, no spoilers here. One major plot point had me eye rolling so hard I was convinced I would have a stroke. I also really, really, really disliked the main romance. I felt there was a huge double standard in how this relationship was portrayed based on the genders of the characters involved. This ""great love"" was abusive, emotionally draining, and not what love is in my opinion. While I am all for authors branching out and trying new kinds of books, this book just did not work for me in the least.",1
142,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"edit:The first time I read this one I was pretty excited to have a latino rep here (specifically from my country, El Salvador), but then, I realized that latino characters are stereotyped as secondary, and very flat, characters, are not well developed and their only function is to serve the main character. I'm talking about Luisa. The fact that immigrants are threated this way makes me sick. I loved Evelyn Hugo, but please, stop writing latino characters like this, or poc in general.my blog reviewmy spotify playlistmy pinterest boardjUST EDITING TO ADD THIS:""And there we are again, when nobody had to know.You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath.Sacred prayer and we'd swearTo remember it all too well.""1st read:“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.”Note:If you haven't read the book and don't wanna spoil yourself, please don't read any further. My review is full, or partially, of major and minor spoilers. And it seems like I can not restrain myself of that, lmao.With many playlists on Spotify (wordkey: evelyn hugo), I readThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugonot knowing (very naive of my part tbh) that my heart was gonna be torn apart like a piece of paper. Huh, who would said it? And even the playlists are masterpieces, and have many Taylor's songs, which iS SO GODDAMN PERFECT.I must warn y'all that I'm still crying.This book is perfect. The writing, the pacing, the characters, the romance, the trageDY, MY FUCKING HEART IS BROKEN, TJR, PLEASE, WHY DID YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO MY SENSITIVE HEART?Anyhow.We have the famous actress and gorgeous woman, Evelyn Hugo, who is known for her many movies back at the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's, and for the scandals of her seven marriages. Evelyn Hugo is announcing that she will auction 12 of her most memorable gowns through Christie’s to raise money for breast cancer research, of which her daughter, Connor, died.Monique Grant is a reporter for the magazine, Vivant, and is specifically by Evelyn Hugo to write her autobiography, but, why Monique? What does she have for someone like the legend Evelyn Hugo wants her to write a book about her life? That's the interesting part.So, Monique goes to Evelyn's aparment and listens her story. From how Evelyn lost her mother and how she swored she would get out of Hell's Kitchen, away from her father and poverty, and because her mother dreamt with became someone famous and live in Hollywood one day. She was born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban parents, but had to change her name by Evelyn Hugo.She talks about how she made her way to L.A, how much she sacrificed and her husbands, of course.My 3 favorite husbands are: Rex North (he was one of my 3 favorite marriages) to get more money for the movie their starring: Anna Karenina (the gods know how I much love Anna Karenina, so I'd have given my kidney or soul to see that movie). They both agreed to this plan and they're happy this way... Until Rex's pair, Joy, is pregnant and they want to get married. Celia is also married with John Braverman.Harry. hE IS MY PRETTY BABY, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. DKFJDJFGHJFG. I really loved Harry, he and Evelyn are best friends, wich makes their relationship normal and not forced. Evelyn and Celia get back together, and Harry and John are dating, which is cuTE, DON'T TOUCH MY KIDS. Evelyn and Harry have a kid: Connor. And then, everything goes downhill when Evelyn films a movie with her abusive ex-husband, Don Adler, and make a sex scene.Celia is sick and knows she's gonna die, so they form this plan to move to Spain, Evelyn has to marry Celia's brother, Robert (he's the third), so Celia's things belong to her when she dies. They do it, but then, Harry dies in a car accident, where was another man with him. Evelyn is devastated by the loss of her best friend and let me tell you that I cried so much with this.When Celia died, a big part of me died with her. It was heartbreaking.""I had lost her. My love. My Celia. My soulmate. The woman whose love I'd spent my life earning.It broke me. I cried until my head hurted.The pacing was amazing. It grab you from the beginning and lemme tell you tHAT THIS WAS ADDICTIVE. I wanted to know more and more, until I got to the end, until there was nothing but my broken heart and my tears falling on my shirt.The characters had an incredible an amazing development. You fall for most of them, and wanna kick many of them too. *cough* Don, Mick, Max. *cough*Evelyn is such a badass woman. A legend. An icon. Not just that. She was a wife, a mother, a lover, a friend. She was not just her talen and her great body.I fell in love with her and her story, with many of her husbands and her wife.My heart is broken tbh. But this book is totally worth of it.I laughed with Evelyn, I cried with and for her, I get angry and sad... I just fell.And the twist for Monique? Ugh, that ruined me as well.All the feelings in this book are deep and explores the sexuality and feelings of a woman who didn't know she could feel more for someone else than a man. And I'm glad that she and Celia got married at the end. :')I didn't know the complexity of this book, and the hype is worth it!!!ALL I KNOW IS THAT I WANT A CELIA ST. JAMES FOR ME, OK?____________________I'm a mess of tears right nowRTC",5
143,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,This book was quite literally *stunning*. I loved exploring the flawed and beautiful life of Evelyn Hugo. There's something about this book that makes you feel like you're reading a true story & I easily found myself wrapped up in it. The pacing is something that stood out to me as the beats of the story evolved in such an engaging way. love love love!,5
144,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo,"""Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.""Wow, this might just be one of my new favourite books. It was so real, so pure, so touching, I just can't believe Evelyn Hugo never existed outside of the book, like how is she not a living, breathing person??""Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.""",5
145,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","“The Housemaid” by Freida McFadden is just one of those novels that for years to come, I will speak highly of and recommend to anyone that wants an incredible thriller. One that’s also filled with mystery and psychological terror all wrapped together brilliantly. From McFadden’s excellent writing style to all the characters I absolutely loved, this is easily one of the best novels of 2022.It’s a very addictive read that is so hard to put down, you’ll more than likely find yourself reading deep into the night because it’s a genuine page-turner. I loved all the little revelations that pop up here and there on top of an incredible story. Just when you think you have it figured out, this novel turns your world upside down.Don’t worry, I will not go into any specifics or spoil anything for you but I’d consider this a must-read novel. Besides the fantastic pacing, I also loved all the New York references since I’m a New Yorker and it really felt close to home. Thinking back on everything, I can’t tell you how many authentic jaw-dropping moments I had while reading this as this novel completely blew my mind.The ending was beyond satisfying and just something I didn’t expect at all! LoL saying it was a drop-the-mic moment is an understatement. This was a wild, insane, fun, adrenaline-filledthriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. It was a wonderful reading experience as I wish every novel I read was like this!I give “The Housemaid” by Freida McFadden a perfect 5/5 as this is a masterpiece. I’ve read many novels in my life and this is one of the most memorable ones that will forever stand out for me. This novel was unique, exciting, and everything you could ever want in a thriller and then some. It’s a rollercoaster of a read from start to finish and I can honestly say that McFadden has a new reader in me. This was the first novel I’ve read by her and I’m genuinely excited to read more of her work and whatever future novels she writes. She is an amazing author with one incredibly creative and talented mind!",5
146,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","3.5 stars — I decided to read another Freida McFadden book because I wanted a page turner that didn’t require much thinking. “The Housemaid” had gotten numerous high reviews so I decided to try it. The book started off very good and had me hooked from the beginning. It tells the story of Millie a recent parolee who is homeless and in need of a job. When she gets hired by Nina and Andrew as a live-in housemaid/nanny she believes she has found her dream job. But soon she realizes that Nina is a very difficult person to work for (think Meryl Streep in “The Devil Wears Prada”). I really enjoyed the interactions between Millie and Nina and her family. I was squarely in the 4.5 to 5 stars range up until the final 30 pages or so of the book. I won’t spoil it but to say the actions of the police, Enzo, Millie and Nina were ridiculous is such an understatement of how bad this book came to a close I can’t describe it. I don’t remember yelling out “No” and “come on” and “really” while reading a book before. (Yes I’m weird) but I had no choice considering the epic plot collapse that left me shaking my head. Even with a full 1 star reduction I enjoyed the book and will have to read the sequel to see if McFadden can return to the form that had me on the edge of my seat for the first 90 percent of the book.",4
147,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)",4.5!!!,4
148,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","Thank you Bookouture and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. IYKYK, my reviews are always honest.Writing: 3? 2? idk out of 5 | Plot: ????2???/5 | Ending: 5/5 tbhAfter letting this marinate for a couple of hours, 2 stars is the way to go.THE PLOTMillie is living in Casa Nissan aka her car when she's hired as the maid for the Winchesters, a ridiculously wealthy family. She's over the moon to have a job and a bed, but she quickly realizes something funky is happening in the home. And she's not sure if she'll make it out alive... dun dun dunnnnnn!!!!!MY OPINIONHonestly... I'm confusion. This is how I felt after I readThe Trapped Wifeby Samantha Hayes. On one hand, this was garbagio, on the other hand, it had some things that kept me reading and enjoying myself. It's a book I love to hate and hate to love all at once. Ok, let me try to make sense of thoughts:- Millie's POV is straight up ""dear diary"" style. As in, ""I spent 7 hours cleaning the house and I thought about Andy Winchester's bangin bod the entire time. He is so dreamy. Does he like me too????"" It's also giving me ""rages to riches"" fanfic written by a tween vibes. BUT AT THE SAME DAMN TIME... the book was legit funny in parts???? Like great dark humour throughout????- Millie's character makes no sense. Not a spoiler—she spends 10 years in jail. Yet she has zero survival skills and seems relatively unbothered by the fact she was locked up for an entire decade. I'm telling you right now I can't last 10 MINUTES in jail unscathed, so a whole ass decade would have me coming out on some Rambo shit.- I did not like Nina. She was over the top, selfish, and illogical. I can't feel sorry for what she went through because .... No spoilers.... but if you read it, you'll know.- The ""mystery"" is kinda obvious. It's likeThe Wife Between Usmixed with... idk,Gone Girl? There wasn't really any suspense. You know what's gonna happen. From Part II onward I was speed reading like a mf. But I was invested in the whole revenge vibe like ok girl go OFFFFFF.- I gave the ending 5/5 because it's women's history month and that's all I can say without spoiling it- I've readThe Locked Doorby this author and this was a totally different vibe. Good for her for going in a totally different direction with no projection of her medical career/knowledge in the story. I'm not sure if it worked, but at least the ending was better than Locked Door.I can see people really enjoying this or really hating it. Do not expect this to be a literary masterpiece. You will not be mentally stimulated in any way. This is your standard popcorn thriller but not as annoying as Unmissing, Stay Awake, etc because of the dark humour. This is the type of book you read afterMy Dark Vanessarips your heart out and stomps all over it.PROS AND CONSPros: you'll keep reading because you don't know if you like it or hate it, awesome dark humour, great endingCons: vapid plot and characters, rags to riches fanfic written by a 14 yo vibes, dear diary ass writing",2
149,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","The plot twist in this book got me good!! I never ever saw it coming🤯. I love how this book started out so creepy and eerie, with Nina behaving so weirdly, and then really escalated in the second half to full-on dangerous. I also love how Millie is so mysterious. We don't know much about her for a huge chunk of the book. It was fun to slowly unravel more of her back story. The only downside to that, though, is that it did take me a little bit to care about Millie because we didn't know a lot about her in the beginning.Overall 4 stars! A fun, fast-paced mystery/thriller. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I wish there were a few more mini-plot twists sprinkled throughout, but overall, I really enjoyed it and would definitely read the sequel!!",4

151,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","This book is not as clever as it thinks it is.Everyone is trying to gaslight everyone else and it’s messy.We know next to nothing about Millie for at least 60% of the novel…so why are we supposed to care about her?Millie could make more of an effort with Enzo. Italian to English is right there on your damn phone.Nina’s chapters are bizarre.I’m still not sure what the “big” twist is. There are several reveals, but nothing earth-shattering.This tries to be an upscale version of Minka Kent...or a low-budget version of Sarah Pinborough. But the characters are so thinly developed that the author leaves everything to hinge on plot—a dubious choice, at best.You probably won’t want to put it down. But you will be asking yourself what the hell you just read.",3

That I should get out of here while I still can.""As this is aspoiler free reviewit's going to be short and sweet as I can't say too much. I can see why this psychological thriller is so popular! It's definitely a fast faced page turner.The plotMillie Calloway is hired to be an in-house maid for the Winchesters’ in a time when she is desperate, living out of her car and no one will take a chance on her. The Winchesters’ are a very well off, upper-class couple who have a 9 year old daughter, Cecila. When Millie enters the house she starts to realise that not everything is as perfect as it seems. Unfortunately for Millie, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.╰⪼Thoughts""There’s something about this room that’s making a little ball of dread form in the pit of my stomach.”The first 30% of the book was pretty slow for me but once I pushed past this it really picked up. This book is filled with plot twists and when you think you have it figured out, there's further reveals. It kept me on edge and while I did suspect some things earlier on, there was definitely a lot of build up towards the end that I didn't see coming 👀 The few twists I did guess didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book. This was my first Freida McFadden book and won't be my last.I found the writing style to be quite simple and the chapters were relatively short which made this book binge-worthy.The Housemaidis perfect if you are new to the thriller genre or picking one up after a long time. The few issues I had in the first 30% which kept my rating from being higher was that I felt the author was trying too hard to tell me how to feel as the hints and 'thriller elements' weren't subtle. I also found the last couple of chapters to be a little rushed. I wanted to have chills but I sadly didn't feel that way but I was definitely hooked on this book.Overall, I thought the epilogue was fantastic and I can't wait to see what happens in books 2 and 3. This book is very entertaining and will whisk you away into the thick of it. There are some slight romance elements as well which might entice you to pick this up if you are new to thrillers.

I literally could not stop reading once I started. This is my first read by Freida McFadden and it will not be my last. I am such a fan and now want to go read ALL her other books.This is a book that is better to go into blind so I am not going to say too much. All you need to know is it’s a story about Millie, who is down on her luck and living in her car. She desperately needs a job and is hired as a maid working for Nina.Do yourself a favor and go read this book now! Don’t walk to get it, RUN!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ALL the stars!",5
157,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","Crazy is as crazy does......The Housemaid is one of those illogical reads that just keeps your sticky fingers gripped to the pages. You want to shake it loose, but you simply can't. It is so bizarro that you keep clicking on your cell phone to check if the world is still out there and you're not registered somewhere in a padded cell.Millie comes up short where luck is concerned. She's always been at the wrong place and at the wrong time pretty much all of her life. Millie's been living in her cramped little car for some time now. Her last job didn't pan out and she's counting the slices of her cheap bread and bologna. She can't even get a job flippin' burgers. No good references. No good options.But then an ad has been posted for a live-in maid with light duties. Millie interviews with the elegant wife/mother in her elegant house with her elegant handsome husband. Against all odds, Millie gets the job. But Nina, her new boss, is a bit ""off"". Nina has spent some time in a psychiatric hospital. She spins on a dime from day to day. Cecelia, nine years old, is spoiled rotten and lights up Millie every chance she gets. Millie feels sorry for Andrew, the husband, who is caught in this emotional blender on high speed.Freida McFadden presents a whirlwind of events here. The pace and the short chapters keep this one afloat. The storyline has a familiar ring to it as those of us who've read a billion psychological thrillers know. McFadden throws in a few zingers and twists to liven it up. Foolish people get fooled. Street-wise never do. But you press on just to experience the final outcome. And when it comes.....it comes. Not a blockbuster read by any means, but it's already been popular because of that eye-poking cover. Check it out and see what you think.I received a copy of this book through NetGalley for an honest read. My thanks to Bookouture and to Freida McFadden for the opportunity.",3

But the way it's told is chef's kiss. The author is quite talented, reading it was envisioning it. The story is told in three parts, I found part 1 and part 2 to be quite predictable but part 3 is what wowed me.It is only when I learned Nina's truth, that I found myself sympathizing with her (to a limit). I liked Millie, although I didn't like some of her actions. Andrew was.... I got no words.If you want something easy, quick, fun and thriller to read- this is it.",4

However, oh boy, this book absolutely deserves every bit of its never-ending hype. It exceeded my expectations, had me gritting my teeth, squirming restlessly in my seat, and, even though I anticipated the delicious twist from the beginning, I still admired how the author perfectly developed this smart cat-and-mouse game. The last third, in particular, was exceptionally brilliant! I knew right from the beginning that I would enjoy this heart-throbbing, jaw-dropping, unputdownable, twisty psychological thriller, but I didn't expect to love it even more and immediately decided to jump into the next book of the series, despite some reviews emphasizing that it might not be as good as the first one. I just couldn't resist spending more time in Millie the maid's disturbing, mind-bending world!Meet Millie: recently released from prison for a crime we don't know if she committed or what kind of crime she got involved in. She's homeless, living in her Nissan, worn down from her latest job at the bar, getting rejected even from burger joints, barely having a chance to start over at her young age (she's in her mid-twenties, a pretty girl, but she disguises her beauty behind glasses and baggy clothes, just in case somebody thinks she's too attractive to be hired). She can't believe her luck when her application as a housemaid at Winchester House (correction: it's a mansion surrounded by a gate with a beautiful landscape) is approved by Nina Winchester: a stay-at-home wife, a bit overweight, dressed only in white, a sophisticated woman who seems friendly at first sight.Millie is introduced to Nina's little girl, who looks like she jumped out of a Children of the Corn movie with her weird baby doll dress, white-blond hair, and spoiled brat attitude that rubs her the wrong way. Then there's the father, the breadwinner of the family, the overly handsome Andrew Winchester, who seems like Prince Charming and whom Millie can barely stop herself from drooling over.Millie doesn't mind that she has to live in the attic, with a room that has the tiniest window that never opens and a lock outside the door that mostly gets stuck. She also keeps herself in check as Nina's emotionally unstable behavior pushes her buttons until they nearly fall to the floor. She can't flip the bird to her unsatisfied, bickering, witchy employer and her irritating, annoying little daughter because if she doesn't get a good reference from her employer, she's forced to live in her car, violating her parole, which could send her back to prison. She keeps her mouth shut, but it's not easy to deal with Nina's mood swings.When she learns a dirty little secret about Nina's past and gets warned by the hot, candy-like landscaper Enzo, who unfortunately speaks only Italian, she realizes that by accepting this job, she may be putting her life in danger. Especially when it's so tempting to get seduced by Mr. Winchester, while his wife watches them like a jealous hawk, ready to tear her limbs apart. Oh, Millie, you've found yourself in another prison you can't escape, haven't you?Overall, I'm giving this highly earned five stars and diving into the next novel of Millie the Maid as fast as possible! This story has truly captivated me, and I can't wait to see where Millie's adventures take her next.",5

161,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","“Welcome to the family,”Nina Winchester said as she greeted Millie, her new housekeeper. Millie desperately needs a new job. She doesn't have too many choices and one that provides her with a place to live, sounds like heaven as she has been sleeping in her car.Every day she cleans the home - it's gleaming and spotless. That is until Nina comes down and makes a mess and makes Millie clean it up again. Millie can't help but wonder why. Then there is the groundskeeper who warns her of danger when she first arrives. But Millie shakes it off. She can deal with one spoiled housewife. Her spoiled daughter is another issue, but Millie tries to win her over. Then there is Andrew - the achingly handsome husband who must put up with a demanding and erratic wife.Millie tries her best, but will her best be good enough?I had the luxury of having both the kindle and audiobook versions of the book. I enjoyed the narrator and being able to go back and forth between the book and listening to it in the car. I thought the narrator did a great job!This was a fast-paced book which grabbed me from page one. I felt as if Nina was inviting me into her home and into her family. It was fun to be a fly on the wall, and watch the drama unfold. The characters in this book are an interesting bunch. Just who do you trust? Who is a reliable narrator? Who has secrets? How juicy and fun this book was! Pure entertainment.I love trying to figure out what is going to happen, where the plot is going, who is telling the truth, who is reliable, etc. This one kept me on my toes. I found it to be fun, dramatic, surprising, and hard to put down!Thank you to Bookouture and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

162,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","This was a FOMO read, for me!All but TWO of my friends loved it, so I had to squeeze it in!! Unfortunately, I am in the same camp as the two who were NOT thrilled with it! 🤣The BEST part for me was the EPILOGUE which sets up the sequel-I think that’s a first!!In Part One, Nina Winchester is looking for a maid to clean, help out with her daughter Cecilia, and perhaps prepare a meal on occasion. The person she hires will need to be desperate for a job, and have CERTAIN personality traits.Millie fits the criteria.She is willing to live in the tiny ATTIC room, with only one window, which seems to be painted shut, and has a lock on the OUTSIDE of the door-and she is tolerant of Cecelia who is dressed up like Wednesday from the Adams family, but definitely doesn’t have the manners of a pretty little girl.She must also need the job enough to also tolerate the split personality of Nina, herself!I enjoyed Millie’s sense of humor, and was curious to see where this would go-initially.Then came Part Two, and there is a SURPRISING twist, but it’s very OTT and the story goes off the rails at this point. 🚂And, in PART THREE, the story twists yet again.Sure, I realize this story is meant to be taken with a grain of salt, preferably served on buttered popcorn, 🍿 but, the last two parts were too crazy for my taste!But, there are MANY 5 star reviews so, IF the crazier the better is what you are looking for-it should satisfy YOU! 😉",2
163,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","Outlier alert!!Millie = the ex con has just being hired as a maid. Phew! Big relief all round because she’s been living in her aged Nissan for a while.Nina = the wife. Her mood changes like the wind whipping through British seaside resort in the middle of winter. Pretty bonkers in other words.Cecilia = the daughter. A brat.Andrew = the husband, McDreamy in a power suit.The story is divided into three parts.Part one is Millie and although the storyline is OTT it’s readable though for an ex con Nina sure ain’t savvy.Part two is Nina and this is where the thing comes crashing off the rails and plummets into the depths far below. It’s utterly bonkers and not in a good way. Then we get to part three where scenes get more and more unedifying and as for swallowing that ending… er, just nope. The very definition of totally unrealistic.What was the best part? The End.Something tells me I won’t be reading book 2!!!Here’s hoping my next read is better than the last two. 🤞",2
164,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for providing me with a copy of this novel for an honest review. It has been published in April 2022.""The Housemaid"" by Freida McFadden was a bit of a disappointment to read.First of all, the tagline ""From behind closed doors, she sees everything"" must have been chosen by someone who never read the book, because it couldn't be farther from the truth: Millie goes through the novel blissfully unaware of everything that happens around her, be it behind closed doors or not. Even the most telegraphed plot twists somehow catch her by surprise, despite all the warning signs and the not-so-cryptic warnings she receives from other characters. The only ones who see everything from behind closed doors areAndrew and Enzo, and how sad it is thata novel written by a woman, with a woman as a protagonist, should depict both its female main characters as such hapless damsels in distress?Nina has no agency at all, she's only good to be rescued by her super-hot, muscled, Italian stud, and even Millie shows no initiative at all up until the very ending.On the good side, the narrative flows easily enough, making the read a quick one. On the not so good side, there are some huge plotholes that make the whole novel feel like a joke: for starters,Enzo's charade doesn't hold water. It's simply not believable that a man in his thirties who has lived and worked in the US for 3 years, being employed by a dozen families in such a posh neighbourhood, and who is considered the best at what he does, would not speak any English at all, not even the most basic communication that Italian children are taught in primary school. When we find out that he's just pretending, it's even worse! How would he ever get a job with all those very wealthy, very elitist families if he wasn't able to let on that he spoke the language? How would he be able to follow his customer's instructions, to the point that he's considered ""the best at his job"", if he had to pretend he didn't understand them at all?And what about the ""translating apps"" that Millie mentions in the very beginning of the book, hoping that they'll help her communicate with Enzo, except then she never uses them, never mentions them again and spends the rest of the novel complaining that she has no way of communicating with Enzo?What about the security guard who searches Millie on the basis of a random phonecall tipping him off about her alleged shoplifting? In the real world, no security guard in their right mind would do such a thing: they would more likely enquire who the person calling them is, and how can they know who is a shoplifter and describe how the shoplifter is dressed, since they're calling *from outside the shop*.How can Millie describe her new, tiny attic room in the Winchester house as an ""inhuman place, like a torture chamber"", when she's been living in the back of her car right before moving to said attic room, and has spent 10 years in jail right before that?Let's not even mention how far-fetched the twist aboutthe policeman's daughteris, and how it would be absolutely impossible to simplydrop an investigation like that, even if a random policeman decided to.Still, I wouldn't have minded the plotholes so much if the characterisation hadn't been so bad: literally all of the characters, including the protagonist, are nothing more than stock characters, flat, cartoonish figurines in no way relatable or interesting. On top of that, all 4 main characters (I'm counting the 9-year-old brat as well, yes) are completely, irredeemably despicable. The only vaguely likeable character is Enzo, but then he's a walking stereotype, so in the end I didn't like him either.",2
165,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","The Housemaid is one of those psychological thrillers that was creepy…. Yes I said creepy characters that put shivers up my spine the whole way through,I thought I had it worked out but not tthe reveal had my head spinning, I loved every twisted sick moment of this book.Frieda McFadden writes a twisty sick prose I could not put down.Nina & Andrew Winchester have the perfect home Andrew has his dream job & they have a daughter Cecilia who goes to a private school, they both decide to hire a nanny to take care of their huge home & Cecilia, so Nina interviews Millie who has been living in her car& finding it hard to make ends meet she was fired from her job at a burger joint& thinks the nanny job would suit her down to the ground. She gets the jobNina welcomes her to the family she is delightful at first but Nina has a dark side that when you cross her things start to go to hell.When Nina shows Millie her room up in the attic Millie senses an uneasiness about the room dread consumes her, from here on nothing is what it seemsThe Winchesters are an influential family but Andrew thinks Millie is unfairly treated& tells Nina to cool it.But what is real & what isn’t?There are so many read herrings in this story the mind boggles all I can say this was so good & scary it made hairs in my neck quiver, this was my first read by Miss McFadden & wont be my last one thing I thought Cecilia was a spoilt little brat who got on my nerves big time but once I read the backstory it all made sense.",4
166,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","Holy guilty pleasure! Popcorn thriller at its finest.I started this book thinking I’ll get the temporary satisfaction of a quick thriller (my favorite genre of book) and move on to the third Harry Potter afterwards. Nope. This book made me want to hop back on that thriller train. 😱I wasn’t expecting the most as I’ve seen a lot of mixed reviews, but personally, I flippin’ loved it. And can I just say…how weird and creepy is that cover? 🤣I was all about the five star on this one, but I moved it down to 4.5 and rounded down because of three things.1.) The daughter Cece is a capital B.R.A.T. and later in the book the mom’s just like ‘oh, you know…that’s just how she is!’2.) Millie makes frequent comments about how Andrew couldn’t want to be with Nina because he wants more kids and she’s having trouble conceiving. It was mentioned about 3 times and it kind of seemed like a triggering statement to keep making if the reader has problems conceiving. This is supposed to be the protagonist but it’s really a horrible thing to say and I couldn’t really forgive the statement after the third time.3.) There was a scene (without going into specifics) that was so wildly reminiscent of Kevin Smith’s movie ‘Holidays’ (the Halloween portion). It just didn’t seem very original when I felt it had major potential to be.Seriously, crazy page-turner and edge of your seat good. I thought it was an awesome book and I can’t wait to read the second!4.5 rounding down.",4
167,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)",4.5 stars!! ❤️Great first read of the year! Oh this was fun!!

168,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","This is the dumbest thing I have ever read. I am pissed about the high rating. There wasn’t a single thing that made even a tiny bit of sense, and it just kept getting dumber and dumber, even when you didn’t think it was possible.",1
169,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","MISS FREIDA HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!My second book from this author and I know I'll eat them all up.As always, not much to say about a thriller without spoiling anything (that would just be bad), but let's sum up the thoughts.FIRST OF ALL, ABOUT THE PLOT! Millie is a young woman who spent last 10 years of her life in jail. Once she's out, there's not much she can do. She switched a few jobs and needs something good to finally settle down and stop living in her car. She goes to this job interview for a housemaid. A rich family is offering her a room in their lavish house if she does the cooking, cleaning and occasionally takes care of their little daughter. Millie is surprised when she gets hired, surprisingly, her new boss didn't do a background check on her! However, when she starts the job, her life quickly becomes a nightmare. And the worst of all, she has a room in the attic where she's sleeping, and the door lock ONLY locks from the OUTSIDE. She's not gonna end up locked up again, is she?THOUGHTS I've read Never Lie by the same author previously and fell in love on page 1. The way this author writes is just so twisty and mesmerizing, she knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat. The plot twist in this one wasn't as shocking, BUT the way the plot developed from that point couldn't be predicted in any way. Summertime is always the thriller season for me and I'm so happy I kicked off this season with something as good as these books. Usually, I don't really care about characters in thrillers, I'm there for the mystery and mystery only. But, surprisingly, I found myself really invested in these characters and their background stories, can't wait to find out more in the sequel. Yes, this book has a part 2.Freida McFadden is becoming one of my auto-buy authors! 🤞",5
170,"The Housemaid (The Housemaid, #1)","Whoa, that ended quickly.Kinda similar to a book I’ve read a few months ago but a little bit more exciting. I can’t say I liked any of the characters, though. I feel like Millie could’ve just walked away when things got out of hand but she didn’t. She was also blinded by money and some of her actions were selfish and stupid.Also, the twist was obvious. We have a “too perfect” character and I was suspicious the whole time. Haha. So when my doubts were confirmed, I wasn’t catching my breath. The ending was unrealistic and couldn’t be further from the truth, like, how? Well, this is fiction so maybe that’s acceptable.Overall, this was OK. The suspense was there but I wasn’t entirely hooked.Cheers to Bookouture and Netgalley for the ARC!",3

AT YOUR BIG AGE?• also. every time tiktok is mentioned in a book, an angel loses its wings. you're telling me lily knows about tiktok and gen z but she doesn't know that ellen is a horrible person? ok• atlas is literally so bland. like i get it. he’s nice. he makes sure to say that he’d never hit a woman every five sentences. good fucking job atlas. you’ve reached the bare minimum.• atlas writing lily letters and saying “i love you” in a thousand different ways to offset ryle’s character…balance doesn’t work like that.• speaking of: stop writing her letters for the love of god i literally don’t know if my heart is cold and dead but we get it atlas, you love her and can’t live without her and she saved you. you don’t have to say it a hundred times!! what a waste of paper!!! give us some new content king!• naming her daughter emerson dory kincaid is literally the worst thing lily blossom bloom has done.in conclusion, sometimes you try things and they don’t work out colleen! for me it is ice skating, for you it is writing. and that’s ok!——————————————————instagram: ellereadsomebooks",1
175,"It Starts with Us (It Ends with Us, #2)","5 starsLet me start by saying this: there’s going to be a lot of hate for this book for the sole reason people just want to dislike this author for their popularity and there’s this hate train going on for the littlest things this author does so I already know people are going to just come out of the woodworks and find the tiniest thing to hate on this. That is not to say that this book is perfect or that your review will be disingenuous. Books are subjective-- therefore there can be books that I love you hate, and books I hate that you love. I just don't understand or stand for the unwarranted amount of hate that goes into BASHING books just for the way they are written. I have been reading Colleen Hoover since 2012- Slammed was my first book by her. I have had many misses with her along with many hits.With that being said; I read It Ends With Us in 2016. I truly loved how it ended, I thought it was the end. I did not ever expect it starts with us and yet I could not think of what a beautiful and necessary addition this is.It Starts with Us shows the after effects of abuse in every form. It shows how realistic, how tragic and how even a happily ever after is still shadowed by the ache and reminder of abuse.I know people are going to be mad at how often Ryle shows up here but that’s the reality of how abusive situations are, they don’t just die or leave you alone— colleen did a fantastic job at showing how realistic this situation is, at how much of a gaslighter he is.For the Ryle apologist and stans: I’m so glad Colleen wrote this book because there’s NO room for y’all’s bullshit. He is an abuser. This isn’t a dark romance. This is a contemporary romance where an abuser stays abusive, continues to be abusive in the tiniest ways and the cycles are broken. He truly and will forever be a terrible person and I’m so glad that this book continuously highlighted that. Abusers don’t “change” and even if they do, the cycle should be broken forever.We get to see Lily and Atlas as an unit and we get to see them really fall in love with their love. I so deeply appreciated that aspect. We really do get to see them find their way back to each other and then fight for their love. This is THEIR story now.I also want to add, I loved the side characters. Every single one of them. Theo and Josh stole my goddamn heart. The only thing I rolled my eyes at was Lily writing to Ellen still but alas a book can’t be too perfect.Atlas has always been book boyfriend material but this book really cemented him as one of the good guys, and if not one of the top 10 book boyfriend’s in existence. I was not expecting this to get 5 stars from me, my favorite book by Colleen Hoover is Reminders of Him but this really deserves five stars for how thoughtful, realistic and just downright beautiful this was.It ends with us was about Lily and her journey to end the cycle of abuse. It starts with Us is about Lily and Atlas navigating life after ending their own cycles.We’ve reached the shores turned into You can come home now.",5
176,"It Starts with Us (It Ends with Us, #2)","I don't dislikeIt Starts with Usper se, but it does feel more like a long and unnecessary epilogue toIt Ends with Usrather than the separate, worthwhile story it should've been.I remember vividly the experience of readingIt Ends with Us, how every page felt riveting and every moment essential. There were so many memorable scenes, so much emotion embedded in the pages. I sobbed my way through it, especially that ending that completely gutted me. To prep for this book, I reread the ending, and sure enough, it walloped me again.So it's rather disappointing that this story didn't do anything for me. There was no emotional punch, no compelling conflict. It took me days longer to read this than I anticipated because I didn't feel any pull to keep going. And now having finished this, I'm already unable to point to a single memorable moment because there honestly weren't any.But then, that's always the fear when an author gives in to fans and writes a sequel or prequel they originally had no intention of writing, isn't it? That the result would be mundane, at best an unnecessary add-on, at worst ruining the legacy of a previously amazing work. (I'm looking at you, Harry Potter and The Hunger Games.)More spelled out isn't always better. Whatever I had imagined in my head for Lily's future, it was more interesting than what I got. And in fact, to spell out Lily's future in the way that this sequel did took something away from the difficulty of Lily's decision at the end of the first book. Part of what I loved about that book was the nuanced and flawed characters, while this book distilled everyone down to either just a good guy or a bad guy.The other issue is that there is no real conflict or surprises in here. Sure, I enjoy reading a happy ending as much as the next person, but not for 300+ pages. It's clear without having read a single page of this book what will happen and who will end up happy. And sure enough, the story progresses and ends exactly the way you'd expect. And that just does not make for an enthralling read.This all sounds rather harsh, but it's really not that bad. It was an alright way to pass a few hours if you're not quite ready to leave the world of Lily and Atlas. This pleasant and unexciting story won't leave you breathless, but it shouldn't offend either. Just be ready to forget about it almost as soon as you're done.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Ends with UsVerityReminders of HimRegretting YouUgly LoveLayla~~~~~~~~~~~~",3
177,"It Starts with Us (It Ends with Us, #2)","2.5⭐️If you love Atlas individually or Lily and Atlas as a couple, this is the book for you, you’d love this. However, I don’t feel like a sequel was necessary. The ending in It Ends with Us was perfect! It left us to imagine our own ending for Lily and it was realistic! This book was strictly written for Booktok. This doesn’t happen in real life. Women don’t always have a Prince Charming waiting for them after they escape an abusive relationship. This is why these idiots on TikTok are romanticizing this shit, thinking this is some kind of love triangle. Ryle is clearly still ill and it shows in this book?? CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FUCKING GASLIGHTING HE TRIED TO DO TO LILY?”You won’t leave her with me overnight, but you’ll drop her off somewhere else when you want to get fucked? Great parenting, Lily.”“You disappoint me Lily.”“ I was happier before I met you.”HOW DARE PEOPLE DEFEND THIS FUCKER? BECAUSE OF HIS TRAUMA? HE KILLED HIS BROTHER AND HAS BEEN BLAMING HIS ANGER ON THAT SHIT EVER SINCE. HE THREW HER DOWN THE STAIRS. HE SLAPPED HER FOR LAUGHING. HE BIT HER. THEN PATCHED HER UP LIKE A CABBAGE PATCH DOLL. OMG. DID NO ONE NOT FIND IT DISTURBING THAT THIS MAN WAS A SURGEON? AFTER HE HURT HER, SHE DIDN’T EVEN HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL, HE IS THE HOSPITAL. THAT IS SO SCARY. FUCK YOU RYLE AND FUCK WHOEVER IS OBSESSED WITH YOUR TOXIC ASS.So clearly,When I read It Ends with Us, I didn’t care about the romance or Atlas as an individual. Atlas is very likable, but it wasn’t about that for me. I was more invested in Lily’s healing process and her story, I still felt that way going into this book. I truly just wanted to read this to see if Ryle would end up in fucking prison. I wanted to see if he was still wreaking havoc. Maybe I thought in this book, Ryle would acknowledge he’s a fucking monster and he’d watch Lily flourish happily from the sidelines. I couldn’t wait for the moment Lily stood up to him, that’s all I was looking forward to. I was only emotional for those parts specifically, I really don’t care about Atlas and Lily y’all.Theo making fun of Atlas was funny, I actually loved that because THE KEEP SWIMMING LINE WAS CORNY AS SHIT I DON’T CARE“We finally reached the beach, my little whale.”LMFAOOOOI wasn’t fond of the diary entries to Ellen in the first book and I especially didn’t like them here. It was cute when she was younger, but we’re grown folks now Lily. Ellen is not reading that shit, cut it out. Anyway, this was mid. Lily was too damn kind. Call me bitter, but if it were me, I’d leave Ryle to rot in hell and not let that man anywhere near my child.↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓My review before reading this:Few more days, it ends with us isnt my fav by her, but I’m pretty excited to read this!",2

Was Colleen tryna reach a word count or smth?35%is the vandalisation/secret brothersubplot which I desperately wished was Ryle's doing💀 imagine grown ass Ryle writing ""ass whole"" and ""fuck u Atlass"" as petty revenge. Because y'all know he is a wife beater with a sense of humour...Ryle after another day of abusing and manipulating:You disappoint me Lily.This is the opening line his drunk ass choose to text after having lily in a chokehold💀 why is he so extraMy biggest highlight of the whole read isTJsaying this😭Also Ryle three paragraphs later:have fun fucking the homeless guy.Can y'all believe it took them THIS long to send that man to therapy?Anyway, the tiny bit of5%is Ryle being Ryle.....clearly🡹💀and the other45%is Lily and Atlas's dry ass hehe romance.The first book was good for what it was. A story about domestic violence and abusive relationships. Ryle was the spine, without his character there would be nothing except another boring coho romance.

191,"It Starts with Us (It Ends with Us, #2)","1.5In short, ‘It Starts With Us’ is nothing but an extended epilogue that could’ve been a bonus chapter. Everything about this book annoyed me; from lack of plot and bland characters, to commentary devoid of nuance and whole sections of the first book copied and pasted into the text. Something smells like a cash grab…I’ll admit; the discussion around abuse in this book wasn’t AS bad as in ‘It Ends With Us’, but it still felt pretty one dimensional and pissed me off at times. I can’t for the life of me understand why this series is hailed as one about ending the cycle of abuse, since the cycle of abuse in the books doesn’t even end!SPOILERSI understand that it would be very hard for Lily to win over Ryle in court, and the ending was probably more realistic with him still being involved; but if that’s the case, it doesn’t “end” with you and your daughter! If Ryle doesn’t have Lily in his life to abuse, guess who his next victim is going to be?Not to mention the fact that Lily’s closest friends are Ryle’s sister and his best friend; it is close to impossible to heal from abuse when you are still in such close proximity to your abuser. The way Allysa and Marshall talk about Ryle as if he’s a little kid who just gets mean sometimes, instead of the violent wife beater and attempted rapist that he is, is so strange…. Maybe I’m the weird one, but if someone I “love like a brother” were to push their partner down the stairs and bite them so hard they bled, I simply wouldn’t love them like a brother anymore!Allysa in particular was extremely annoying in this book. “Why would Ryle hate Atlas if you didn’t cheat on him 🥺🥺” idk girl maybe it’s because he’s abusive, which you have known for years now! The whole “me cheating on my husband doesn’t count because I was 19 ✨” thing was also???????????Idk man. Everyone in every Colleen Hoover book sends off massive alarm bells in my brain.“Problematic” aspects aside; ‘It Starts With Us’ was just plain bad a lot of the time. I feel bad for anyone who was looking forward to seeing Atlas’ perspective since he has about as much depth as a paper plate. We get it; Lily saved his life and he loves her! Fascinating. Now stop talking about it every 30 seconds and grow an actual personality, for the love of God! Pages of love letters and wedding vows don’t make up for an absence of depth, and certainly not lack of banter and attraction between characters.I don’t know if CoHo needs to go back to school or something, but there’s a biiiiiig difference between history and chemistry, and our main characters are missing the latter. News flash! Trauma bonding doesn’t mean you’re soulmates!! These people need therapy, not each other. I honestly think the story would’ve been more powerful had Atlas and Lily just been friends. Love cannot cure the trauma of an abusive relationship, no matter how strong it is.Rapid fire nitpicks from yours truly include; Ellen Degeneres, confusing time jumps, this being categorized as romance, the fact that only Atlas’ wedding vows were shown, and Emerson Dory being named Emerson Dory!Do yourself a good old favor and don’t waste your time and money on this ❤️",1

195,"It Starts with Us (It Ends with Us, #2)","– 2.25 starsThis book was not necessary and clearly fan service for BookTok. Colleen even said that herself in the Acknowledgement section.I’ve readIt Ends with Usyears ago and that book made me bawl my eyes out, because it was such an honest and realistic story about a women finally ending the circle of abuse in her family. IEWU had a purpose and meaning. Whereas,It Starts With Usreads like every other second-chance romance between two past lovers that shared a connection in their childhood. Reading Lily and Atlas romance gave men o t h i n g. This was dryer than any cactus in the dept of the Sahara. Their interactions made me yawn, I’m sorry but Atlas was better as a side character in IEWU. Atlas is (maybe) the most unproblematic Colleen Hoover Hero, but imo that also makes him the most boring one.“I don’t have a picture of her,” I say to Theo.”So she’s ugly?” I toss the box of glass into the dumpster.“She’s gorgeous and way out of my league.””Ugly would still be out of your league,” he deadpans.12 year old Theo who talked like he was going on 50 was my favorite character in this book. And you know why? Because this little kid was pretty much bullying Atlas every time they interacted and I loved it. Some adults should be bullied more. 💅You disappoint me Lily.I was happier before I met you.Have fun fucking the homeless guy.Y’all can say anything nasty about Ryle and I would completely agree, but you also have to admit that this guy is nothing but ✨ consistent ✨ in his abusive behavior. My face was this 😐 emoji the whole time, except when it came to Ryle, cause at least that guy gave me some emotions.. his texts to Lily even made me laugh… Lily, sweetie I’m sorry but your ex-husband humor is immaculate 🤡🏃🏻‍♀️ Ryle kept me on my toes, cause I never knew what else would come out of his mouth or what would happen at the mercy of his fist. What an unpredictable king. 😌There is this toxic belief that family should stick together simply because they’re family. But the best thing I ever did for myself was walk away from them.ConclusionIt Ends With Us should have stayed a standalone. It had the perfect bittersweet ending that was on point with the whole book.

202,"It Starts with Us (It Ends with Us, #2)",This feels like nothing more than a cash grab. Atlas is a bare minimum decent human being (who slept with an underage girl) and doesn’t need to outshine the story of domestic abuse and survival like the last book portrayed.,1
203,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow I will still be thinking about this brilliant book.Fair warning that I am predisposed to adore coming-of-age novels about protagonists of my generation (Gen X), apparently even if I don’t have much in common with them other than birth year. In this case, the protagonists are Sadie and Sam, two friends whose lives intertwine up, down, and around their love of gaming.It must be said that this book is VERY MUCH about video games. Sadie and Sam play them, talk about them, design them, and promote them over the span of thirty years. What a testament to author Gabrielle Zevin’s writing that I could be glued to the pages of a story about a topic that typically bores me to tears! Because I loved Sadie and Sam so much, I never lost interest in their worlds - either the real one of their day-to-day existence or the virtual ones they were building.They are, without a doubt in my mind, the two characters I’ve cared about the most over the past decade of my reading life.I do say that with a bit of trepidation, as I know some readers of this review who love me (shout out to my mom again!) will want to read Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow to meet my new literary best friends. I must therefore point out that while the novel is a masterpiece in my eyes, some people are not going to be able to get through it. Zevin is a fan of obscure words, there are risky techniques used (such as an occasional second-person chapter and dropping readers into a video game world), sad and unsavory things happen in the plot, and the text is fairly dense. This is a long 416 pages.Also, having read (and enjoyed) Zevin’s previous two novels, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry and Young Jane Young, this feels like it’s from an entirely different author. I breezed through those others in a day, but Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow took me a week. I know that’s because I savored every word and often reread entire paragraphs, but that’s my point. If her prior books were hamburgers, this one is a steak.I feel a bit bad for the upcoming books I’ll be reading in the wake of this novel, since I know nothing will compare for a very long time. In case it’s not clear enough already, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow has a well-earned place on my all-time favorites shelf. When you finish the final page of a book and hug it to your chest, where else would it go?My sincere thanks to the author and Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for the gifted review copy via NetGalley.

204,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","***5 Stars***This was one of those books where, when someone asks you what the book you are reading is about, you are kind of at a loss for words. Because, as the blurb stated, this was essentially a book about two good friends making a video game together.But was it?Not gonna lie, I wasn't sure where I would land on this when I decided to pick up late via BOTM add-on. (See, I even skipped over it when it was one of the monthly picks).Despite being a child of the 80's and 90's, I never played videogames. I know, I know...the horror, some of you might be thinking. But, whelp, my dad was adamantly against us playing them, convinced it would make us lazy and turn our minds into mush.Well, while I can't say that I'mnotlazy or that my mindisn'tmush despite never being a gamer, Icansay that, based on the one or two times I played it at a friends' house, Ireallysucked atMario Kartanyway.But I digress.Like I said, never having been a gamer, I was worried about how that might play into my enjoyment of a book which, on the surface, was centered around video games.But again...was it really?Yes and no.This was about so much more than video games, folks. So much more than standard friendship. I can't even explain what I mean here...It just encapsulated so much of the human experience in such a bold, yet nuanced way.In today's western culture--which is seemingly insistent uponeverythinghaving to be a social justice/political statement that slams you over the head on exhausting repeat--the way this book handled said topics felt...organic.Showing not telling.Allowing me toabsorbthe message instead of simply beating me over the head with self-righteousness.So refreshing.Also, there are so many elements of the book that felt personal to me...that struck a chord with me. I won't get into them; but, suffice to say that, again, this book was very much about the human experience. And the way the author used video games as a platform for it all was super creative. And super well executed, in my opinion.Originally, I rated this 4.5 instead of 5 stars; however, I've thought about this book a lot since finishing it several days ago. And anything that makes me self-reflect...that moves me enough to contemplate the facets of it days later...deserves the full five.P.S. You don't need to be a gamer to love this book.P.P.S. You do need to love Marx.",5
205,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","Complicated and MemorableTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,is a multilayered novel about friendship, love, and video games.Sam and Sadie met when they are kids and quickly bonded over their love of video games. They develop a friendship that spans almost 30 years. The novel follows the highs and lows of their friendship, including falling in love, falling out, a love triangle, successes, and failures. Throughout it all, the one constant in their lives is video games.The narrative alternates primarily between Sadie and Sam's POVs.Sam and Sadie are both loveable, arrogant, infuriating, and flawed.The dynamics of their friendship are complicated by love, jealousy, and misunderstanding. I got a little sick of the friends to frenemies cycle between Sadie and Sam (more of Sadie’s anger towards Sam, but I understood her point of view).I loved them, but I also wanted to shake some sense in them.Sam’s mother, Anna; Marx, Sam’s college roommate; Dov, Sadie's professor; are some additional characters who make an impact.My favorite characters were Sam’s grandparents, Dong Hyun and Bong Cha.The novel blends reality and game worlds, and parts of the narrative take place in a virtual open world.All characters are well-developed and multidimensional. Even the avatars are multidimensional.I am not a huge fan of video games, but this book made me nostalgic for the video games of my childhood.I got all of the Oregon Trail and Mario references, but there were times that I was a little lost, but I didn’t mind because I learned so much about gaming.The reader doesn’t need to know much about video games to enjoy this book (but it might help!).There are also a lot of 80s, 90s, and early 2000s pop culture references mixed in. I loved reading the details behind creating a game and the gaming industry as I was introduced to a whole new world.This is a well-written, complex, thought-provoking, and original novel. I was invested in the characters, and some moments hit me on an emotional level. I got teary-eyed towards the end. I won't forget these characters; this is a book that is going to stay with me for a long time.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.",5
206,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","I feel... really disappointed by this. I've loved Zevin's books in the past and I was lured in by some of the early starred reviews that promised I would be enchanted by this book. I can see the many interesting themes the author is juggling here and have highlighted a few passages I thought were noteworthy, yet a few moments of brilliance just couldn't make this book any less tedious for me.The story is essentially about gamers and video games, throwing up constant references to the history of gaming and gaming culture. The two main characters, Sadie and Sam, bond over playing video games when the pair meet in the children's ward of a hospital and later conceive of, and program, games of their own. Their own personal stories-- involving family, friends, sexism in the industry and abusive relationships (contains emotional manipulation and sexual assault) play out alongside this.I will confess that maybe it is just my disinterest in the world of gaming that drives my apathy towards this story. I have played my fair share of certain games-- caught them all in Pokemon, explored the worlds of Final Fantasy VII onwards, built a fabulous neighbourhood in Sims, employed some questionable antics in Grand Theft Auto and, to a lesser extent, tried my hand at Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and The Last of Us.That being said, I do not consider ""gamer"" to be a defining term for me. I would always rather read. And my interest in games does not extend beyond the games to the culture surrounding it.Kirkus assured me that even those who ""have never played a video game in their lives"" will love this book, but I feel like that probably isn't true. I found it a struggle just to make it through and I kept finding excuses to check my email, google something random that occurred to me, or just do household chores instead of reading this.Some people have commented on it being a long book, but 400 pages isn't all that long. It feels much longer.",2
207,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","this was a hard pass for me. I know I'm in the minority, but I do not need to be emotionally and traumatically destroyed while reading. The prose was pretentious and unnecessary. Both characters are rather insufferable, immature, and showed no growth. For a book supposedly celebrating friendship, this was the definition of a TOXIC, unhealthy platonic relationship between male & female. I'm honestly not sure what the moral of the story was? Other than let's make sure to include every single controversial issue possible and make our stance known. I also really despise murky endings.every CW imaginable: gun violence, death, suicide, grief, car accident, toxic relationship, shooting, injury jury, homophobia, chronic illness, racism, sexism, toxic friendship (and more…)",1
208,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","this book made my heart ache.the lives of sam and sadie are raw and complicated and messy. the narrative is such an accurate depiction of human growth and the adjustments friendships have to go through because of those changes. and, just like real life, not everything goes according to their plans. there were life choices of theirs that i didnt agree with and moments when i was 110% rooting for their successes. some sections where i was bored with the uneventfulness of their careers and other chapters that had me riveted by the worlds they created.while i do wish there was more of a traditional plot and quicker pacing at times, theres no denying that i came to care about sam and sadie.↠4 stars",4
209,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","My gosh, this book was never ending. It felt like the same story over and over: friends fight, make up and make a video game together, fight again, everyone switches partners, make another game…I’m sorry, but none of the characters were convincing—would you really call your unborn child a parasite? Would you really not talk to your business partner for months? Not talk to your best friend for years because of one little tiff? Everyone is reviewing this book as some great example of friendship, but that’s not how I’d treat my friends. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did.",1

214,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","Obviously, I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't particularly enthralled.A lack of concentration plagues Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, a novel I found to be lacking. The narrative jumps from the present to various points in the past without providing the reader with an opportunity to get emotionally invested in any of the protagonists, except maybe Marx.In general, the overall writing was pleasant. Particularly interesting to me was the genuineness of the content concerning game design and production.Unfortunately, as someone who has spent a large portion of their adult life working in the gaming industry, I found the protagonists' talks of game design and development outside the scope of their debut game Ichigo to be tedious.The story was dull and I found the author's constant urge to stay woke to be obnoxious. While I respect her intention to raise awareness about pressing social concerns, I found that her preachiness frequently derailed the narrative and detracted from the plot. I find it fascinating when authors of fiction skillfully weave explorations of societal concerns into the fabric of their narratives. Unfortunately, in my opinion, Zenin did not carry out this action.Finally, while the first half of the book is interesting and well written, the second half falls apart under the weight of its own ambitions.Should you still read it? Probably based on all the other reviews.Rating: 3Follow me on Instagram!",3
215,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","This book is so utterly pretentiousness and trying so hard to be woke that I should have given up on it instead of seeing it to the end. I would have if the beginning hadn’t been so beautifully done. There’s a line in the book about a video game sequel being awful because it was farmed out to Indian programmers who had no interest in the game and that’s how this book feels after the incredible start. The beginning was layered, nuanced and artfully done. I hate flashbacks but this book had managed to layer the present, past and future in such an incredible way before it fell off a cliff and suddenly feels like an entirely different writer took over.The story began with Sadie and Sam central to the story. We found out about them in a narrative that skipped around in time to let us understand them and their relationship. Sam was the obviously the more sympathetic of the two and the one you as a reader care about. Sadie was often annoying and then fell apart in a ridiculous way. I hoped her awful college self with the horrible college boyfriend would evolve and grow up but she never does. Even worse for the story is the tangents that from that point became the story. We suddenly get a new character who is rightly called boring later on. He is a NPC. He’s just too good and uninteresting to take up so much space. We get his backstory we don’t need. In a similar way later on we get two new characters that happen to be gay that bring nothing to the story other than a celebration of their sexuality which apparently is worth their inclusion. Much like tangents about their game that take up unnecessary page time and continue to dilute any attempt at storytelling. There’s plenty of politics, even to a ridiculously degree like actual comical bad guys intent on violence against those in favor of gay relationships and marriage. Ironically for a book full of wokeness with characters never being straight, celebrating gender fluidity, the book managed to ridicule cultural appropriation. The book is very focused on the race of the characters but never explores them in more than a superficial way.One of the author’s worst faults was her pretentious word choices. Instead of writing in way that flowed she chose to constantly check her thesaurus for jarring words like jejune and verdigris every couple of pages. Ironically much like the criticism of a game her character created this book is pretentious and full of itself. The worst part is that could have been amazing if it had stayed as focused as it was in the beginning. This is not a story worth the journey so do not push play. I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.",2

It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time.""occasionally, i would read a book that leaves me speechless, unable to grasp my emotions. this is one of those times.i won't give a summary ofTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrowbecause i am incapable of doing it even if i want to. in my opinion, the synopsis doesn't do it justice, either. the best way to understand this book is to experience it yourself.this is a tragedy intertwined with a love story, but not any love story. i went into this expecting to read something likeAlone With You in the Ether, and i closed this book knowing that no story resembles this one.Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrowis an incredible tour de force. to write something as meta as the process of making video games with a lyrism this profound is no easy task. Zevin's descriptions of the process, so technical, transport the reader into an imaginary world so vast that at one point, i saw myself in the game sam and sadie made. additionally, i salute the author's courage to include difficult literary techniques (e.g.: second-person pov) in an already intricate setting.ultimately, the brilliance of this book comes from its characters. i don't think i have cared for characters this deeply sinceAlone With You in the Ether. sam, sadie, and marx are written with depth and empathy. they evolve like real people would, for better and worse. their humanity shines through the tragedies, pulling me into their suffering: that's how i know that characterization can only go so far. this is what differentiates unpleasantly brilliant books from mediocre but entertaining ones.and god, the intimacy between the three characters. there is something about the chemistry, the interactions, and their thoughts that made me wonder: can love can be greater than this?in the end, i know that this book is absolutely not for everyone, and not everyone who loved and hated this will feel the same emotions throughout the experience. for now, i leave this book at 4.5 (it will change eventually) butTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrowwill stay in my mind and my heart for a long time.--------------------------pre-review:this book induces in me such profound grief, that i am feeling physically unwell.rtc once i recover",5

Enough can’t be said about these memorable characters!The tale cleverly weaves interesting backstory into the fabric of this story, exploring a refreshing take on redemption and betrayal tropes.Zevin’s prose hits all the right notes. She expertly implements a variety of writing styles, and, with unexpected twists keeps the reader guessing until the very end!Gripping characters? Check.Engaging, riveting plot? Check.My favorite US city for setting? Check.Tomorrowx3 (yes I know many of you are cringing at the abbreviation) is an unexpectedly brilliant, complex novel that will haunt me for many years to come.What was in the Magic Eye at the subway station?!?!?!?Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",5
218,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle ZevinJennifer Kim (Narrator), Julian Cihi (Narrator)Young Sam and Sadie meet in the hospital, brought together by a love of gaming. Sam, whose foot has been crushed in a car accident, hasn't spoken to anyone for months but meeting Sadie, and playing video games with her, brings Sam alive, pulls him out of his pain and heartbreak. That friendship lasts for a while until one of them feels betrayed and then it's over.Eight years later an accidental meeting has them back together. Their love of gaming, their ability to create games, leads to collaboration and the making of games. They are successes at game making but that success pulls them apart again. While the playing field can be even for everyone when they start a video game, giving everyone the same chance to build and conquer, the real world sees everyone differently. One gets more credit than the other, resentments and misunderstandings grow. Even when working together, Sam and Sadie are apart in the most hurtful ways.This is the story of Sam and Sadie but Marx is a part of that story. Marx, who plays games but doesn't make games, becomes a crucial part of Sam and Sadie's company and their lives. Marx is the best friend a person could have, he's the best partner a person could have, he's the mediator when it's needed, he's the glue that holds things together. He's the person Sam tries to imitate when he doesn't know how to go on.This story contains three decades worth of brilliance, creativity, friendship, love, romance. jealousy, resentment, isolation, miscommunication, and more. Maybe some huge successes require people to be somewhat broken and misunderstood. Definitely love does not have to be romantic to last a lifetime. When it comes to Sam and Sadie, it's taken them years and years but I do think they finally mature in the end and there is something to be said for a maturity that might allow estranged people to come back together.There is lots of talk about creating and making games and playing games. Sometimes we are in a game. I loved all of that. I understand gaming and I can get lost in the worlds that allow us to forget our real world. Worlds that allow more than one life, dying doesn't have to mean death, you have more chances to go on or start over. All of that is so interesting to me and I laughed whenever the word dysentery was mentioned. But this story really got to me because there is a lot of sadness, isolation (something gaming can even cause), and anger. I wanted everyone to be able to be a Marx. But that's not how the world works, not everyone can be a Marx, life is not that easy for everyone. I'll be thinking about this story for a long time and will probably see it differently as time goes on. It will take me a while to get over this story, I'll need time to let it just settle in my mind.Pub July 5, 2022",4
219,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","So I found this book very entertaining and easy to read and also disappointing at times too. Starting with what I enjoyed about the book, I found the prose so readable. Gabrielle Zevin has a knack for telling a good story and about 100 pages in, I felt immersed in her characters’ lives in a way that only some of the best writers can execute. There’s a slice-of-life quality to the storytelling inTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrowthat helped me feel like I was gliding along with Sam, Sadie, and Marx’s lives from their college years to their early and then approaching mid-adulthood. The video game aspect of the story actually made sense to me and added a quirky touch to the novel that didn’t come across as gimmicky.I also liked the integration of social commentary in this book through the characters’ lives. I felt a lot for Sam and his struggle with his disability and Sadie with her experiences of sexism in the video game industry and in life generally. Zevin does a nice job of showing and not telling so that these elements of social justice/injustice felt organic instead of too obvious or preachy.I think my biggest critique of this book centers on Sam and Sadie’s friendship. I will couch this commentary by saying that I read a lot of literary fiction and it’s one of my favorite genres so my expectations are reasonably high. I found their friendship engaging, though at the same time I don’t think Zevin developed the foundation of their friendship enough to merit all of the conflict and turmoil they experienced. For example, Sam consistently idealizes Sadie throughout the book and is all “I love Sadie Green even though I can’t tell her” and I was like uh why?? Like I get that they had a somewhat intense bonding experience as kids and then they made video games together, but I literally had no clue why Sam actually loved Sadie – she treats him pretty horribly throughout the book as he does to her at times. I get that friends can treat each other poorly, though I struggled to believe Sam and Sadie’s bond given that they get into these intense arguments all the time and then resolve them by… forgetting and forgiving instead of communicating through the conflict and processing what actually happened?? Idk, maybe my best friendships are so healthy to the point where it feels a bit incomprehensible to me (shout-out toBrione of my bestianas who’s also on Goodreads!)As a side note, I think I’m spoiled because I read Jhumpa Lahiri’sThe LowlandandUnaccustomed Earthearlier this year and late last year respectively, and she sets the bar so high in terms of characters with rich inner lives that then manifest in their interpersonal relationships. Hanya Yanagihara pulled this off too inA Little Life, though I don’t recommend her other books lol.I also felt frustrated by the overall treatment of friendship in this novel. For the first 60% or so, there’s this implicit and explicit theme of friendship being important and special and not inferior to romance. However, this deteriorates when certain events happen later on in the book. Like, at the very end, Sam literallysays that he felt insecure that Sadie didn’t want to be with him romantically/physically because of his disability, his Asianness, his lack of wealth… which implies that he actually wanted a romantic relationship with her all along… which undercuts the importance of friendship. YikesLike, Sadie is a white woman from a wealthy background, why did Sam feel so entranced by her?? Idk, it reminds me a bit too much of Asian men who are obsessed with white women’s approval and being attractive to white women instead of loving themselves (likethis tweetdepicts). And I don’t think Zevin sufficiently showed an arc of Sam learning to love himself, even if imperfectly, which would have been my preference even if it’s not everyone’s.Anyway, as you can tell this book was engaging enough that it elicited this long of a review from me. Again, I was entertained and immersed so I can see why so many people hyped this book. Not my favorite though a story with interesting elements and relevant social commentary for sure.",3
220,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","This is my first taste of author Gabrielle Zavin, and I have to say I was impressed, this is beautifully written and smart storytelling that goes back and forth in time, embedded in the world of gaming. I am not a gamer myself, so if you are not either, do not let this put you off, because this is essentially about the all too human aspects and the complexities of what it is to be human, the connections made through this medium, such as the relationships, the friendships and the joyful delight to be found in a perfect digital world, a sharp contrast to the problems and difficulties that are to found in the more messy real world. Sam and Sadie first meet fortuitously in the late 1980s as children in a hospital, finding common ground in playing games, like Super Mario, competitively.Memories comes flooding back when they meet again years later at a rail station as we follow their lives evolving through the decades, as they begin to create games together, setting up in business together, the creative input balanced by the grounding and practical presence of Marx. They do extremely well which brings all the pressures and trappings associated with success. The characters are vivid, distinct and from diverse backgrounds, in a narrative that touches on a wide variety of issues and themes that resonate, like identity, love, loss, family, technology, race, disability, betrayal and inevitable failures, and what is important in life.We are given a insightful glimpse into the gaming industry, its history and business side, and how gaming can help people endure hard times through the escapism it offers. A brilliant and imaginative read that I think will appeal to many readers. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.",5
221,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","there aren’t enough stars to give this book. truly, 5 isn’t even close to enough 😭🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼*EDIT—i have now read this book 3x in 12 months. it truly has my heart. if you haven’t read it yet or didn’t finish it/love it, try again with the audiobook. it gives you such a feel for the characters personalities as it’s a character driven book. at 70% is when it will WOW you ❤️ trust me!!!this book is SO unique and beautiful. the more i sit with my thoughts after finishing, i realized how much i loved it. i miss these characters already—i felt like Sadie, Marx and Sam were my best friends 🥹the character development in this book was arguably one of the best i’ve seen. i listened to it on audio and was constantly going like 😮 or laughing at their banter and arguments.if you’re looking for a plot heavy book, you’ll be disappointed. while there are a bunch of “twists” in the back third, it’s mainly just a story about 3 kids growing up, making video games, becoming famous, FRIENDSHIP, dealing with life, going through relationships, etc.highly recommend trying it out—for someone who reads as much as myself, it was so refreshing to read a new, unique story that’s really never been done.thank you to LibroFM for the gifted ALC and Knopf for the gifted hardcover! it’s a beauty to have on your shelves, too🤩*UPDATED THOUGHTS AFTER MY 2nd AND 3RD READ THROUGH*🎮 the friendships. Sadie, Sam and Marx truly feel like your best friends. their banter and relationships are real, pure, hilarious and amazing🎮 the plot—it’s unique, kinda nerdy, and the back 1/3 will leave you speechless🎮 the 1990s nostalgia. video games, the Oregon trail, life without cell phones, simplicity🎮 the audiobook. the narrator does such a fantastic job and with all the dialogue, it flows so well and gives you a better feel for the personalities🎮 the character development is arguably some of the best i have ever seen🎮 the prose… here are some of my fave quotes:🫶🏼 “it’s better than romance. it’s friendship.”🥹 “you can do anything,” Sam said. “i completely believe in you.”🌎 “i love hearing your ideas, Sadie. that’s my favorite thing in the world.”😭 “because he loved Sadie. it was one of only a handful of things he knew to be a constant about himself.""🎮 “i don’t feel like anyone in the world knows me except Sadie.”💖 “sammy,” she said. “we were together. you must know that. when i’m honest with myself, the most important parts of me were yours.”",5
222,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","A tale of friendship, a lesson in love and a perpetual game of life with its infinite number of second chances, lost opportunities and endless possibilities. And at the centre - love and friendship of course.“What is a game?"" Marx said. ""It's tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It's the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever.”The PlotA chance meeting at a hospital is to connect the lives of Sadie and Sam through video gaming and home entertainment. A relationship that is tested, grows, changes, and suffers from many of the obstacles life creates - love, greed, misunderstanding, vanity, discrimination, domestic violence, abuse, death and many more.However, the constant in their lives is the love and ambition for inventing and playing video games. Yet, like many winning partnerships, their loyalty is tested when fame and success enters their lives and the two struggle with each other, despite the intervention of their loyal friend Marx.While the book includes many side stories and sub plots, the core to this book is the relationship between Sadie, Sam and also Marx with some important themes for the reader to reflect on. There is a sad moment in the book that will play on my mind tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!! But I will not spoil here.Review and CommentsIt was all about the writing style and relationships for me that took the meaning of gaming to a whole new level. The characters felt so real and genuine which came through in the writing and turned a seemingly ordinary plot into something extraordinary.My favourite character was Marx although the two characters at the centre of the story were well developed and had such redeeming and less desirable qualities which I loved because this felt ‘real’.There are a few elements to the story that did not work so well for me. For example, using the title and references from Shakespeare’s Macbeth (and others) “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” implied there was going to be a connection and relevance to the gaming world. The sense of infinity yes but some of the Shakespeare quotes peppered throughout just didn’t work and at times it felt awkward. Only an opinion.I also believe that my reading experience would have been marginally better had I been more familiar with the gaming jargon. So, I decided to set that aside and focus on the relationships at the centre of the story and only then did the book make sense to me.A modern take on some timeless themes. A story of reinvention, infinity, and the possibility of a different life, but also a stark reminder that life is complicated, complex, painful and sometimes intolerable but it is also what we make of it. Despite the distractions and when the game of life becomes the cruelty of life, it is up to the individual to decide on the appropriate course of action, because after all there are no rules and no winners. Just love and friendship made better through willingness and forgiveness.The focus on relationships was superb but I particularly loved the reinvention of Sadie and Sam’s relationship and the quote that says it all…“The way to turn an ex-lover into a friend is to never stop loving them, to know that when one phase of a relationship ends it can transform into something else. It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time.”I loved that “Love is both constant and variable”. True of many relationships. Overall an excellent book, there is no doubt that this book will continue to be enjoyed by many tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!!.",4
223,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","**WINNER OF GOODREADS FICTION GENRE, THIS ONE IS SPECIAL**Initially I had trouble getting through parts of this book and even put it aside for a day. Some of the details of designing, coding and playing video games were tedious for me to read.However, when I tried to get into another book – the characters of THIS BOOK kept calling me back. From 30% on I was invested and fell in love with Sadie, Sam and Marx.It’s important to note that this book covers several decades so it’s hard to describe all that happens with these characters!!Sam and Sadie meet in a hospital. Sadie is there to visit her sister, who is undergoing cancer treatment, and Sam is a patient. He was in a horrific car accident and his foot has been repaired but it will never be normal!! He will be in constant pain!!Sadie and Sam bond over their love of video games, mazes, etc.“They had the rare kind of friendship that allowed for a great deal of privacy within it.”There is a point where Sadie and Sam don’t see each other for years but when they are back together the magic is still there. Ideas are worked out together, code is written, Marx is the producer and promoter andfor a long time all is good.As with all human relationships that span decades, these three will go through many changes, and it’s wonderful to watch how they grow. All the emotions are here, friendship, love, happiness, grief, depression, exuberance – all so well described that I felt it with them!!The writing in this book is absolutely wonderful. I love this quote from Marx“What is a game? Marx said. “It’s tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. It’s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption”.I already miss these characters so much! I would encourage you to give this novel a try, even if you’ve never played a video game in your life!!!I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through NetGalley.",5
224,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","Any complaints I might have about this novel feel too small-minded to write about here, because in the end it convinced me of one of the most difficult things a book can convince a reader of: that our tiny lives, even with all of their mundanity and ridiculousness and petty resentments and disappointments, actually matter, and that our lives are also, at times, fully and heartbreakingly beautiful.I searched my reading past for the last book that made me feel this way and needed to go all the way back toThree Junesby Julia Glass, first published in 2002.",5
225,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","Going back to sleep - will review soon… I Loved loved loved it!!!!!! Absolutely one my year’s favorite!!!!“The most successful people are also the most able to change their mindsets”.But….Not easy, huh?I’m back…I loved everything about this book…It’s adorable, sweet, sad, theatrical, character-collaborative-driven-in-spirit, artful, smart, emotional, intellectually rigorous, perceptive, and wonderful…I could name a dozen more vertiginously exciting . . . vibrant wordsto reflect the deep satisfying experience this novel is.Even at oddball moments, Gabrielle Zevin’s novel flourishes surprising wisdom touching on the most common elements of the heart…..with unforgettable indelible characters.In totality…….IT’S ALL BRILLIANT!…..and VERY ENJOYABLE!!!….the writing, narrative, structure, (the gaming), the characters: (major and minor), and their relationships are LOVABLE as can be….Sadie (Jewish-American) was one of the most brilliant people that Sam (American, part Korean and part Jewish descent) knew.He hadn’t seen her in years—until he did—since their childhood in Southern California. Sadie went to MITSam went to Harvard…..[Sam’s roommate-Marx- is a crucial part of the story, too]…Other favorite characters are *grandparents*… GOTTA LOVE the generations — of love….The context themes of love, loss, and life tragedies, are captured with sincerity, depth, and honesty.This book could only have been written by somebody who has experienced grief to great lengths. Zevin has an impressive imagination and proficient talent…..leaving us readers with a memorable feat of storytelling, fine prose, and heartbreaking real characters.I was one of those readers who fell in love with her novel “The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry”…..(It wasn’t too ‘sappy’ for me as it was for a few of my friends), but THIS….”Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow”…..is more sophisticated….more fully developed….Zevin is in her prime with this novel….……I can’t imagine any reader ‘disliking’ it…..There is something for everyone….many issues to contemplate!!!!…..an examination of very profound friendships—The ‘relationship-complex-love-friendship-issues’ were masterfully explored.The brilliance shines throughout……….with a look at the effects of tragedies, violence, illness, death, parents, grandparents, feelings of loneliness, fitting in, admiration for gaming designers….(especially women in the profession)…love for people, love for one another, and an enhanced respect for the benefits of gaming ……About the aspects of ‘gaming’ ….…..NOBODY NEEDS TO BE DIRECTLY interested….But……I realized by the end of this novel (after tearful melancholy feelings), that there are benefits from gaming….They ‘really’ must improved cognitive abilities, improved problem-solving skills and logic….BECAUSE….…..the characters in this novel (who played and created these games) WERE able to apply their technical skills to their relationships. It was subtle—but not-not unnoticed.So…..parents: I wouldn’t worry if you can’t get your kid to stop playing games too much. It’s amazing how much they are learning about life….in relationship to others.One more thing I must say …..then I’ll leave a few excerpts…I thought the very beginning was MASTERFULLY written. I can’t remember ever reading a book that pointed to the ‘past, present, and the future’ at the same time more magnificently. SO WELL DONE!!!Ok….enough of my excitement….Here are some excerpts:“Before Mazer invented himself as Mazer, he was Samson Mazer, and before he was Samson Mazer, he was Samson Mazur—a change of two letters that transformed him from a nice ostensibly jewish boy to a Professional Builder of Worlds— and for most of his youth he was Sam—S.A.M. on the hall of fame of his grandfather’s ‘Donkey Kong’ machine, but mainly Sam”.NOTE: the above excerpt— written at the start- is worth reading a few times. (IMO)….then let it go…..it will show up in different ways through the rest of the novel.“Sadie! SADIE! He felt foolish. SADIE MIRANDA GREEN! YOU HAVE DIED OF DYSENTERY!”“Finally, she turned. She scanned the crowd slowly and when she spotted Sam, the smile spread over her face like a time-lapse video he had once seen in a high school physics class of a rose in bloom. It was beautiful, Sam thought, and perhaps, he worried, a tad ersatz. She walked over to him, still smiling—one dimple on her right cheek, an almost imperceptibly wider gap between the two middle teeth on top—and he thought that the crowd seemed to part for her, in a way that the world never moved for him”.“It’s my sister who died of dysentery, Sam Masur, Sadie said. I died of exhaustion, following a snakebite”.“And of not wanting to shoot the bison, Sam said”.“It’s wasteful. All that meat just rots”.“Sadie through her arms around him. Sam Masur! I kept hoping I’d run into you”.“What brings you to Harvard Square? Sam asked”.“Why the Magic Eye, of course, she said playfully. She gestured in front of her, toward the advertisement. For the first time, Sam registered the 60-by-40-inch poster that transformed commuters into zombie horde”.“SEE THE WORLD IN A WHOLE NEW WAY. THIS CHRISTMAS, THE GIFT EVERYONE WANTS IS THE MAGIC EYE”.Sadie….with thoseheterochromic eyes…..“In which case, the only proper thing for us to do right now is have coffee, Sam said. Or whatever you drink, if coffee’s too much of a cliché for you. Chai tea. Matcha. Snapple. Champagne. There’s a world with infinite beverage possibilities, right over our heads, you know? All we have to do is ride that escalator and it’s hours for the partaking”.“If this were a game, he could hit pause. He could restart, say different things, the right one’s this time. He could search his inventory for the item that would make Sadie not leave”.“You would think women would want to stick together when there weren’t many of them, but they never did. It was as if being a woman was a disease that you didn’t wish to catch. As long as you didn’t associate with the other women, you could imply to the majority, the men: ‘I’m not like those other ones’. Sadie was, by nature, a loner, but even she found going to MIT in a female body to be an isolating experience. The year Sadie was admitted to MIT, women were slightly over a third of her class, but somehow, it felt like even less than that. Sadie sometimes felt as if she could go weeks without seeing a woman. It might have been that the men, most of them at least, assumed you were stupid if you were a woman”.“What is a game? … It’s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It’s a possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever”.Wonderful….as wonderful as can be!!!",5
226,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","⭐️Goodreads Award Best Fiction⭐️My top read for 2022. A brilliant coming of age masterpiece, spanning almost 30 years. An epic tale of friendship, love, art, video games, and the journey of life.As a teen, I played my fair share of Sonic, Mario Brothers, etc, but nothing with the intensity of this book, realistic games that blur reality and fantasy. I was immersed.Gabrielle Zevin weaved a layered story, carefully crafting characters within the backdrop of gaming and was able to peak my interest all speaks to the beauty of her writing.This is the story of Sam and Sadie, Sam and Marx, Sadie and Marx, and their journey building a successful gaming company. Sam and Sadie meet in the most unexpected places-a hospital. Sadie's sister is undergoing cancer treatment, while Sam, is recovering from a major injury that leaves him disabled. Sam and Sadie connect over their love for games. Sadie becomes an integral piece of Sam's life and his recovery.Time moves forward, Sam and Marx are roommates at Harvard. Marx is an aspiring actor while Sam pursues his passion for making games. One day, Sam happens to meet Sadie on campus (she's there for a gaming meeting) and they connect (over Oregon Trail of all things). Sadie gives Sam a game she's working on, and the rest is gaming history--a story of creating amazing, creative games together.Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow (an ode to MacBeth, which later, ties beautifully into one of the characters arcs) is the story of missed opportunities, successes, pains, love, and a passion for art.There is a time for any fledgling artist where one’s taste exceeds one’s abilities. The only way to get through this period is to make things anywayZevin not only created amazing virtual worlds, I'd love to play, she wrote an entire chapter within a game--literal genius. There was also a chapter in second person, which may feel out of place to some, but made sense in the context of the character's journey.Initially, I was bogged down by all the gaming conversations, but it's worth it to continue reading. The beginning ties in wonderfully as we learn the struggles of creating true art. Zevin also touches upon some important cultural/political topics that helped move the story along.The truth is, I cried and cheered for these wonderfully written characters, like friends more than fictional souls.I recently read, 'The Storied Life of A.J. Fikery,' and became an instant fan of Zevin. It feels remarkably coincidental that her new book came right after--alas, the stars aligned.I savored Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, felt protective of the words, and had a sense of reverence to the story. Have you ever felt a physical reaction after finishing a book? I was in a melancholy state, wanting to be transported into the pages, stilling time.How could a person still be as young as he objectively knew himself to be and have had so much time pass?As I closed the last page, my daughter wanted to be tucked into bed, yet I wanted to sit with the book and fall asleep- savoring the story. It was hard to let go, say goodbye. The characters came to life in a way that felt tangible.There was the life that you lived, which consisted of the choices you made. And then, there was the other life, the one that was the things you hadn’t chosen. And sometimes, this other life felt as palpable as the one you were living.^^This quote moved my soul.5 spectacular stars!",5
227,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","4.5 starsI'm on a roll, two great books in a row! I loved this book so much because it's about friendship and all of its ups and downs, and yet it is very unique because it's set in the world of gaming. You don't necessarily need to be a gamer or have gaming knowledge to appreciate this book, but it does help if you have some appreciation for it.This is the story of Sadie and Sam who met in a hospital as children. Sam was there recovering from a horrible car accident, and Sadie's sister was undergoing cancer treatment. The two met playing video games together and forged a friendship, which grew and stalled many times over the years. They would go on to create a gaming company and many games together, but the underlying factors in their life and friendship ebbed and flowed continuously.This is an immersive book, full of human actions and interactions. I went from liking Sadie to not liking her and then back again, and the same with Sam. I could understand them sometimes and others I didn't. There are portions of this book that will truly break your heart, because they broke mine and caused me to dissolve into tears. Yet in the end, what are we without each other? And that's what this book communicates best.There are a few slower parts, which is why I didn't round up to 5 stars. It took me a lot longer than it should have to get through this book. But the writing is superb and Zevin really knows how to tell a great story when you get right down to it, so this is a wonderful book definitely worth reading. I look forward to see what she comes up with next.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.",4
228,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","“What is a game?” Marx said. “It’s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It’s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win, no loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever.”Gabrielle Zevin is a Literary Gamer, defined in the NYT review as “someone for whom reading and playing are, and always have been, the same voyage.” Thus, Zevin chose to write a story about one of her joys, gaming. I’m a mother of a gamer. I never understood the passion of my son. I never understood gaming nor why it becomes an obsession. Who better than a favored author to enlighten me? And enlighten me she did!The games that the three main characters play are known to me because they were games my son played: Super Mario Bros, Sims, The Oregon Trail etc. Most of his money earned was spent on these games. I felt it was unhealthy and alarming. We needed to go so far as to cut the electricity in the computer room at night. The advent of laptops killed us as parents. Gaming was a mystery to me, until now.Zevin loosely provides the history of the gaming industry through her three characters. Sam and Sadie meet by coincidence at a Los Angeles hospital. Sam is recovering from a serious auto accident. Sadie is there visiting her sister who has cancer. The two, who are both 11, meet playing Super Mario Brothers in the children’s ward rec room. As a result of a misunderstanding, the two part on poor terms. Sam sees Sadie in a Cambridge Massachusetts train station when they are of university age. Sam goes to MIT and Sadie goes to Harvard. They decide to collaborate on a game. Marx is Sam’s roommate, a theater major. Marx becomes involved in the enterprise because both Sam and Sadie are techs and need a business manager.This is a story of brilliant artists who create something big and exceptional. It a story of a friendship and love. It’s a journey of three innovative artists and their struggles. Zevin adds cultural depth in making Sam and Marx mixed-race Asian Americans. Their racial ambiguity was especially difficult in the 1990’s and early 2000’s.The pains of the creative process is felt in the story. Who contributed the best part? Who’s getting all the credit? Fame and money become the trio’s downfall. This isn’t a story of game development. This is a story of friends and their personal life with snippets of the work and emotions involved in creating a computer game.I enjoyed every word of this novel. It’s beautifully written. I was captivated in their gaming world and their personal lives. Sadie and Sam are geniuses who are personally self-destructive. Marx is the guy who can sooth ruffled feathers. It’s a friendship story, a love story, and a bit of the gaming world.Thank you Gabrielle Zevin! I think I sort of understand my son’s obsession with his alternative universe. I do like the idea that if you die, you can restart your game.",5
229,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","DNF @45%Look it started off really well. But once I got sick, and picked it up after two days, all that interest I had was completely gone. Am sure it is a well written book but it was truly boring me and I found myself skimming pages, and I knew I just had to dnf it, sadly.Sam and Sadie are one dimensional characters (that's based on how much I've read). Marx was a cool guy but even he couldn't keep me interested.With the amount of books I have on my tbr I don't believe I'll ever check it out again.

And i know this is a story i will carry with my forever, but i also know sam is a character i will think about forever for so many reasons.""Perhaps a funny-looking mixed-race kid could exist at the center of the world, not just on its periphery.""trigger + content warnings:childhood cancer, hospital settings a lot (but also a children's hospital), chronic pain + injury (and… choosing not to take… the best care of yourself for these things/neglecting health concerns), amputation, racism, slurs (racist and homophobic), talk of appropriation (emphasizing japanese cultural appropriation in the video game community), mention of abortion, abusive relationships, emotional dependency depiction, drug use, sexism + misogyny - especially in an industry like the video game industry, car accident, death by suicide, student/teacher (college) relationship, power imbalances, some questionable sexual acts where the mc is dissociating, dissociating, blood depiction, talk of disordered eating (and brief mention of death because of it), fatphobia, 911 mention, unwanted touching, captivity, gore, vomit, gun violence, shooting in the work place - this book has A LOT in it, please use caution and make sure you’re in a good headspace for it.blog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon",5
231,"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow","I hate to come in and be a Debbie Downer for this book, but sometimes this happens. There is a specific kind of sentimentality or emotion that just does not work for me at all, but that a lot of people find extremely compelling. It is a matter of personal taste, it is not really about whether a book is inherently good or bad. You either like a book that will purposely tug at your heartstrings or you don't. I don't, ergo this book was not for me.The thing is, that I liked the first half of this book pretty well. I enjoyed the way we see Sam and Sadie, who became friends through playing video games as kids, and the way they come together and then break apart. I liked seeing how their grudges and resentments could trickle in to cause problems, and then it could all be erased through their joy of gaming together.About halfway through this book I started to get suspicious. I had a feeling that we were being set up for something. That the stakes were being purposely heightened. I did not like it! I kept seeing danger around every turn when that was not what kind of book this was. Until, well, I ended up being right after all. I did not like the last half at all. It felt manipulative and bordering on maudlin. It didn't feel like it really earned what it was going for. Also, slight spoiler thoughts behind a tag,Marx is just not a real person! He has no flaws, apparently, besides sleeping around in his early 20's. He is handsome and charming and loyal and apparently good at everything? I never bought his relationship with Sadie and it felt contrived just to give Sadie something to grieve. He is basically an ex machina to make everything happen in the book, it got very annoying.I do not think you need to be a gamer at all to read this book. I'm not and I was able to be invested in everything along the way. Zevin is deft at explaining what makes a game compelling without boring anyone. Ultimately this is a book about friendship that just happens to be set around video games.There were lots of little things that irked me along the way (I will be so happy if I never read another book where a character attends Harvard) particularly Dov's character, who is a pretty terrible person but that everyone decides is just fine because all that happened so long ago, right? It was pretty weird, especially since he treats the only major female character so badly. But there were also lots of little things that I enjoyed, little threads that Zevin would drop and then pick up again (secret highways, the history of Sam's mother, etc.).I just wanted to read a perfectly boring book about Sam and Sadie working together, the highs and lows of their friendship. (In a lot of ways this is similar to a bottle episode of Mythic Quest that I liked a lot, though this had the potential to be better because it was based on friendship more than romance.) But I suspect this book's target audience isn't interested in that and they are here to have their heartstrings pulled. If that is you, there is a lot here that I think you'll like. And the video game elements really serve to distinguish it from the pack.I did the audio version of this book, the reader had actually also read another book I'd read just a few days earlier. I like her style, which she does adjust to the material, but is more of a flat reading than an overly emotional one. I think it suits, balancing out some of the elements in the book. She also has to do a lot of accents, which she manages quite well.",3
232,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","Rating: All the stars in the universe""I needed not to be dead when I agreed.”“You needed not to be alone.”I don't really know what to say in order to adequately express how stunningA Court of Mist and Furyis. How exquisitely beautiful. How slow-burningly sorrowful. How... joyous at the same time. I'm at a lack of words for describing how it truly made mefeel-- because this book resonates with my soul and my heart and my mind so wonderfully, it just filled me with awe from within, leaving me drowning in an eternal swirl of emotions, a ruin because of a mere novel.“But then she snapped your neck.”Tears rolled down his face.“And I felt you die,” he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.This book is a story aboutlifeandloveand every gray shade in between. A story about the bleak days and the lovely winds of change. A story about hard-fought happiness and soul-wrenching sacrifices. And a story about a girl who finds herself drifting away into the fields of nothingness only to discover the stars and moon and night sky pointing towards her glorious rebirth.Feyre, oh dear Feyre. I amso so proudof her and who she's become at the end of the novel. She's so exhilarating and vibrant and incredibly strong. But she was not like this in the beginning. The events in the previous book shredded her apart from the inside out, living only a shell of the brave young woman we cheered for. My heart ached for her. But she finds herself again -- her true self, her wild heart, her luminous spark of daring, fierce, brilliant dreams. And the heroine that emerges is coated with sheer determination, powerful bravery and astounding compassion.I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless again.I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.I want to assure everyone that not one character,NO ONE, acts OOC. And besides Feyre, no one changes. You know what I'm talking about -- the alpha-males vulturing around Feyre. ACoTaR only showed us bits and pieces, but we mustn't jump to the wrong conclusions about certain people especially since the depth of ACoTaR felt (at least to me) similar to a Vegas wedding after meeting a guy in the hotel lobby, whereasACoMaF was a reality check. Harsh and cruel and unyielding.This being said, I liked Tamlin. He was true to himself. Everything he does, he does out of love and of fear of losing Feyre. And we all know that people blinded by love can often make mistakes -- and Tam did. Many mistakes. A lack of understanding intoxicated him and an imperative need for control severed his perception. Paradoxically, we get to know him better even if he's not a present figure throughout the book. And perhaps, now that we've seen more of his layers and facades... perhaps we see him in a much different light. He has issues and I truly believe Amarantha messed him up mentally -- nowhere near the trauma Feyre endured, but still a haunting scar imprinted on his demeanor. Regardless, do not mistake all I've said as excuses in his defense, because they are not. They do not excuse his ultimate authority, his condescending attitude and his infuriatingly rash decisions for which he does need to suffer the consequences.I just cannot wait to see him get his ass handed to him by Feyre.“He did—does love me, Rhysand.”“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”Rhysand, on the other hand, was the epitome ofdamn. I might even have a confession to make... He might...*gulp*... have overthrown Will Herondale and Dorian Havilliard as my favorite book boyfriend!!Rhys embodies the highest standards for fictional males. His bad-boy allure. His arrogance. His cunning mind. His elegance. His astounding power. But these are nothing compared to his internal beauty -- his selflessness, his nerve-wrecking intensity, his carefully crafted mask, his turmoil and his kindness. His self-doubt brought me to my knees, because he is such a precious cinnamon roll and he doesn't realize it. Andholy shithis past was just too much --I WAS (AM) AN EMOTIONAL MESS.“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written?” Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I’d seen it. “I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince—the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”And you wanna know what?HE'S A GODDAMN FEMINIST. If that doesn't make you fall in love with him head over heels, I don't know what will. Plus Rhys is basically the hottest fictional guy ever created (Darkling + Warner + Dorian = omg). WHY ISN'T HE REAL???*sobs*“Tamlin won’t allow it.”“Tamlin isn’t your keeper, and you know it.”“I’m his subject, and he is my High Lord—”“You are no one’s subject.”***“Maybe it’d be a mercy to be ended—A broad hand gripped my face—gently enough not to hurt, but hard enough to make me look at him. “Don’t you ever think that,” Rhysand hissed, his eyes livid. “Not for one damned moment.”***""She wins,” Rhys breathed. “That bitch wins if you let yourself fall apart.""Lucien remains clever and intuitive and even though his relationship with our heroine gets stranded, his only flaw is undying, blind loyalty and I cannot fault him for that.Moving now onto more serious topics -- the new characters. We have quite a lot, but by far the loveliest ones are Rhysand's Inner Circle.They're squad goals. FierceMorrigan; strange and kickassAmren; sassy, arrogant and skilledCassian; reserved and observantAzriel. All these, plus Rhys, entangle a dynamic that createsa family. I loved them to bits. Secondary characters, yet so wonderfully nuanced, three-dimensional characters that gut you with their own stories and make you shed a tear at how much they love each other. Plus, they cracked me up on a constant basis. And the respect and unflinching support they have between them was all kinds ofwowandawwww.Okay. Enough with the stalling. Let's venture into dangerous territory akathe romance.*deep breath*I want to start by sayingthere is no love triangle-- there's onlya wonderful, all-consuming and healthyrelationship that evolves naturally until it reaches paramount heights. I was constantly plastered with a stupid, goofy grin on my face whenever this couple interacted or was simply in the same scene. What makes them absolutely beautiful in my perspective isthe mutual respect, honesty and supportthey have for each other -- it paints them with anempoweringand downright heartwarming glow. Their amazingfriendship, their sparkingchemistry, their hilariousbanterand their hot as helltensionhad me repeatedly blessing the gods for Maas.“He locked you up because he knew—the bastard knew what a treasure you are. That you are worth more than land or gold or jewels. He knew, and wanted to keep you all to himself.”***“I’m thinking,” he said, following the flick of my tongue over my bottom lip, “that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”Besides those strong traits of their relationship, I need to mention the steaminess and sexiness and overallHOTNESS.Because this book? It's hot. Like black-in-the-middle-of-July-in-California-hot. NA, after all. You thought ACoTaR was hot?YOU THOUGHT WRONG-- prepare yourself for hyperventilating, fangirling and swooning, 'cause SJM's writing skills slay in those scenes.“I heard every word between you. I knew you could take care of yourself, and yet … ” He went back to his pie, swallowing a bite before continuing. “And yet I found myself deciding that if you took his hand, I would find a way to live with it. It would be your choice.”I sipped from my wine. “And if he had grabbed me?”There was nothing but uncompromising will in his eyes. “Then I would have torn apart the world to get you back.”Oh oh oh but there are some other ships that get my blood pumping even though they're not sailing -- YET THEY SHOULD. They totally should. Mozriel and Nessian embody pure awesomeness.And Elain and Lucien will be so interesting to see play out!What I enjoyed tremendously about this particular sequel is how it managed to expand the realm beyond its initial borders, in terms of world-building, depth and history. ACoTaR now seems like a small piece of a giant puzzle, the lovely but common retelling ofBeauty and the Beastpaling in comparison to ACoMaF which, while just teasing us with glimpses of the real deal that's to come, contained a sense of radiant and vastepicness.The most special and bewildering aspect is the lush and vivid portrayal of the Night Court. Enthralling and contradictory, it completely enraptures you with its seductive tone. So different from the Spring Court (and Summer Court which we get to visit!!). But I expected something disheartening and equally dark, and while this mysterious court has that vibe and then some, there is also such glorious light and normalcy and elegance that reside in its spectrum. The Court of Nightmares gave me goosebumps. The Court of Dreams, however, gave me breath and life. The book centers in Velaris andohmygod this city! I loved Velaris with all my being and if there ever was a fictional place or universe in which I'd want to live, then Velaris and the Night Court are it.Plotwise, there isn't really much to say, honestly, besides the fact that the king of Hybern is the new big bad wolf (as expected) and he wants to bring chaos into this world. But his presence is subtle, his threat only looming on the horizon -- the finale will deal with him more. Yet we encounter intrigue and secrets and eye-opening side stories and tales that create the legacy of Prythan hand in hand with the world-building. It felt similar toHeir of Fire, a journey of healing rather than grueling war. However, as in HoF, the last few chapters left me breathless and white-knuckled as I gripped the book to read every single word.Betrayals, alliances, resurrections, magic and evil marvelously unraveled in an explosive punch, a mic drop of a sort.It leaves you craving more the very next instant.We'll see more Nesta and Elain and Tam and Lucien in the next book, that's for sure. But the stakes are so high and the game of hide and seek between friends and enemies so dangerous that I cannot help but be in a continual frenzy until the sequel. It's going to be as much of a masterpiece as this one, certainly.A Court of Mist and Furymade me want to re-read it the second I've finished it -- and re-read again afterwards. It made me want to live in its universe. It made me want to be friends with the characters, tell them how much I adore them and just how precious they all are. It made me feel alive in so many ways that it also rendered me speechless.But you know where its absolute beauty resides? It's in the cleverness with which it was constructed. Sarah J. Maas outdid herself -- with the loose threads, with the vibe ofHades & Persephoneand with the countless clues and hints that begged for a re-read of ACoTaR in order to pick them up bit by bit. No one can say she changed her creation to her whim, because it was all carefully planned out, mapped out ever since the first page of the first installment.“You are my salvation, Feyre.”A Court of Mist and Furyis my newfavorite bookand I'll keep it close to my heart from now on. Enchanting, clever and masterfully written, it shattered my expectations and raised itself on a gold pedestal. I love it completely and I hope you'll do so too -- as fiercely as Feyre loves the night.On a chirpier note though, I'll go drown myself into a hell of a long book-slump because nothing,absolutely nothing can come close to this glorious book while its remnants shine so brightly in my mind.ENJOY! <3P.S.:My headcanon fanart for ACoMaF:My Night Court photoset is a bit spoilery, so here's theTumblr link.My ACoMaF inspired playlist --The Stars Who ListenListen here:8tracks;YouTube.",5
233,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","HOLY FUCKING SHIT. HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.***CONTAINS A SHIT TON OF SPOILERS***REALLY, IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK YET, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW.THIS BOOK IS WAAAAAAAY MORE THAN 5 STARS, IT'S MORE LIKE 1000000000000000/5 STARS. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BETHISPERFECT.To be completely honest with you guys, I have absolutely no idea where to start, so I'm warning you, this is gonna be far from an actual review.May 3rd was the day I died.I ran to my mailbox, knowing what awaited me there. I opened it and saw the box, amazon prime tape all over it. I took it and ran back inside my house. I stared at the box and took a deep breath...THEN RIPPED THAT SHIT UP. I CLAWED AT IT, SHREDDING THE WHOLE FUCKING BOX IN THE PROCESS. I SAW THAT BLUE FUCKING COVER AND KNEW THAT MY LIFE WAS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME. I TOOK THAT FUCKING BOOK AND TURNED THAT SHIT OVER. THE COVER WAS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. SCREAMING LIKE I WAS BEING TORTURED IN THE DEEP PITS OF HELL, I RAN AND SAT MY ASS DOWN ON THE COUCH. I OPENED THAT SHIT UP AND READ TIL MY EYES BLED. DAMN STRAIGHT.So all I read in the first 40 pages or so was blah blah blah Tamlin blah blah blah Where's Rhys.And then the moment we've been waiting for happened. The moment whereRHYSAND INTERRUPTS FEYRE'S WEDDING TO BRING HER TO THE NIGHT COURT. FUCK YEAH.The Night Court is the most beautiful thing ever. Could it be any better? No. It was perfection. And when Rhys winnows with her there, Feyre's first instinct is to throw a shoe at him.THE ALL-POWERFUL, MOST FEARED HIGH LORD OF THE NIGHT COURT GOT HIT BY A SHOE.It was adorable.And Rhys helped teach Feyre how to read and it was the best thing ever. All the while training her on her new found powers. These powers came from the seven High Lords and Feyre has all of them.EVEN RHYS'SFeyre became a very strong character in this book, Sarah knows how to work in that character development! She knew how to fight for herself and always wanted to be there to help in times of need. And the reason for leaving the Spring Court forever was because stupid Tamlin didn't let her go anywhere and practically made the estate Feyre's new prison cell. How symbolic. Remember that time Under the Mountain, Tamlin? When your ""beloved"" was trapped in that same cell for three whole months? How you didn't do anything about it and watched her rot? How on her last day Under the Mountain, you wanted to have sex with her instead of trying to free her? Ever think of those things Tamlin? Doesn't seem like it because now you've recreated that same cell that's caused her so much trauma. Isn't he the greatest.When Feyre made the decision to stay at the Night Court with Rhys and the squad (who I adore so much by the way), I was so happy. Not just because that meant Rhys and Feyre time (whoo!), but because it showed how strong she's become and that she finally escaped the captivity of the Spring Court into the freedom of the Night Court. And she is a total bad ass.The Night Court squad is so awesome. We've got Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel who I love all equally. They all have character depth, flaws, and pasts that we learn about. Mor's past was devastating and made me want to just give her the biggest hug. I also enjoyed amren a lot because she looks like she could kill you and will actually kill you. And Azriel and Cassian are also really fun to read about as well. They are all cinnamon rolls.Let me just say, I love it when the girl saves the guy. In this case, it was Feyre saving Rhysand. They were flying and Rhys was hit in the back with ash arrows and was captured and whipped. Now Feyre, she wasMAD.She winnowed and killed the guys torturing Rhys like the total boss she is and saved Rhys from death. I was seriously so scared for my baby.NOW IS THE TIME TO BRING IT UP GUYS. THE MOMENT WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. WE WANTED IT TO HAPPEN FOR SO LONG. AND NOW IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN. READY THE CANON.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES.RHYSAND. AND. FEYRE. ARE. MATES.THE FANDOM RIGHT NOW.AND RHYS HAD DREAMS ABOUT FEYRE BEFORE HE EVEN MET HER. WHEN HE FIRST MET FEYRE HE HAD A SENSE THAT THEY WERE MATES. HE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME, AND IT BROUGHT MORE TEARS TO MY POOR EYES. IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME WANT TO REREAD A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES JUST TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON IT. AND RHYSAND REALIZED HE LOVED FEYRE WHEN HE HELD THE DAGGER TO AMARANTHRA'S NECK.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES AND EVERYTHING IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD.AND WHEN RHYS TOLD FEYRE EVERYTHING, (AND I MEAN EVERYTHING)...(LIKE REALLY EVERYTHING), I CRIED. IT WAS SOOOO.... I'M SORRY I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS, BUT YOU PROBABLY FELT THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW.AND THE NIGHT OF STARFALL. OMG MY BABIES. THEY WERE AT THE BALCONY AND THEY WERE SHARING PERSONAL THINGS (I LIVE FOR THESE MOMENTS). AND THE ABSOLUTE MOST ADORABLE THING THAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THEY BOTH WERE HIT IN THE FACE BY THE STARLIGHT AND LAUGHED. LAUGHED. AND SMILED SO MUCH. FEYRE HADN'T SMILED LIKE THAT IN FOREVER. AND OH DEAR LORD SAVE ME, I'M PICTURING THE GRIN RHYSAND GAVE FEYRE RIGHT NOW AND IT MAKES ME MEEEELLLLTTTT. I JUST SIMPLY CANNOT.Now, let's talk about the hottest scenes ever between my dear Rhys and Feyre.THEY WERE SO STEAMY AND I WAS FREAKING OUT THE WHOLE TIME. I DIDN'T KNOW IF THIS WAS REAL LIFE OR NOT. AND THEY LASTED PAAAAAGGGGEESSS. A GLORIOUS AMOUNT OF PAGES. THESE WERE THE FELLOW STEAMY SCENES:COURT OF NIGHTMARES.THE CRAMPED BEDROOM.MATE REALIZATION. (THE BEST ONE)And Rhys is not who we expected him to be. He's sacrificed so much for his people like I can't even explain becauseHE SACRIFICED SO DAMN MUCH.And I seriously cried when he revealed all these things about himself.MAIN CAUSE OF MY EMOTIONAL TRAUMA RIGHT THERE.I could go on and on forever about the many many many precious Rhys and Feyre moments, but let's talk about that ending.Things were so perfect so far that I was getting scared. Scared that all that perfectness was going to be ripped away and I was going to be one emotional mess. And for a minute there, I was. You guys know what I'm talking about.So Feyre and Rhysand acted like Feyre was under Rhysand's control the whole time so it made it seem like Feyre actually still loved Tamlin and that she wanted to go back with him. And then she wanted to make it seem more real. And I'm like ""FEYRE IF YOU FUCKING TELL THE KING TO BREAK YOUR MATE BOND I SWEAR-"" And then she tells the king to break the mate bond. And Rhysand's screams just shattered my heart when he was about to. And shithead Tamlin's says ""Do it."".AND THE FUCKING KING OF HYBERN BROKE RHYS AND FEYRE'S MATE BOND.I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THEN AND THERE. I COMPLETELY LOST MY SHIT.BUT WAIT. IT'S NOT OVER.RHYSAND AND FEYRE WERE ALSO ACTING THAT OUT TOO. THE MATE BOND WASN'T BROKEN. I REPEAT, THE MATE BOND WAS NOT BROKEN. THE KING JUST BROKE THE BARGAIN WITHOUT REALIZING IT WASN'T THE MATE BOND. THAT LOVE CANNOT BE BROKEN, ESPECIALLY RHYSAND AND FEYRE'S. AND SO NOW THIS SETS UP THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD BOOK. FEYRE IS GOING TO SPY ON THE SPRING COURT AND SEND THE INFORMATION DOWN THE MATE BOND TO RHYS. YEAH FEYRE YOU GO GIRL.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Nesta and Elain were turned into High Fae. And Lucien is mated with Elain. Crazy, am I right?!AND FEYRE IS NOW HIGH LADY OF THE NIGHT COURT.I AM COMPLETELY SPEECHLESS AND AM STILL IN UTTER SHOCK AT HOW BEYOND AMAZINGLY PERFECT A COURT OF MIST AND FURY WAS. I CAN'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS. EVEN A GIF. I JUST-- WOW. YOU GUYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW. RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED.THE THIRD BOOK SHOULD BE CALLED ""A COURT OF PAIN AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA"" BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT'S PROBABLY GONNA GO. HERE COMES THE YEAR LONG WAIT. I DON'T THINK I'LL SURVIVE WITHOUT IT LONG ENOUGH. I WANT IT SOOOOO BADLY!!!!!AND I'M MEETING FUCKING SARAH J. MASS ON THE 14TH AT THE CHICAGO BOOK CON TO GET MY COPY OF ACOMAF SIGNED AND MEET HER IN THE PROCESS! I'LL MOST LIKELY BE RENDERED SPEECHLESS JUST LIKE AFTER I FINISHED ACOMAF. I AM SERIOUSLY SO EXCITED.I WILL SAY IT AGAIN: A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.""To the stars who listen-- and the dreams that are answered.",5
234,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokI almost tossed this down in disgust five times while reading this book. I knew, going in, that it was going to be a massive act of revisionism with regard to Rhysand, the villain of the first book. And as someone who loves villains and thePersephone myththat could have been something I could have gotten behind under the right circumstances. But I wasn'ttrulyprepared for the narrative gymnastics that this book would perform to try to redeem him without really making him do any legwork. By the end of the book, he's still a sleaze lord, only now he's a sad sleaze lord in leather pants who was actually the heroine's soulmate all along and an all around Nice Guy. Pop a fedora on his head and he'd probably ""milady"" his way through the Night Court.Big yikes.The beginning of the book was great, and very much in keeping with ACoTaR. Feyre has PTSD (understandable) and so does Tamlin (also understandable) and they're trying to heal and find the same love for each other that was the fuel for Feyre to save him under the mountain in the first place. The passion between them in the beginning was great. Feyre's misgivings about ruling also made sense. I could even understand why Tamlin would want to be so overprotective. He felt like he had betrayed her in failing to keep her safe and was overcompensating for it in the worst way by essentially treating her like she was made out of glass.Enter Rhysand, who makes good on his bargain to take Feyre back to his court for seven days a month. He actually ruins Feyre's wedding, where she is about to get married to Tamlin but having a major case of cold feet and PTSD. He tells her that her wedding dress is ugly and tells her that she should thank him for saving her the effort of breaking things off, because he is *chef's kiss* a prince among men. *eye roll* He takes it upon himself to teach Feyre to read and write and is so shocked that she was allowed to be illiterate for so long... which was kind of weird to me, because I was pretty sure that TAMLIN was actually teaching her how to read in book one?? Maybe I'm wrong, but I seem to remember Tamlin teaching her to read was a major part of his introduction as love interest.Also, apparently Feyre hates painting now and is totally upset that Tamlin gives her a set of paints as a present. Because how dare he get her something that she used to like but didn't tell him that she doesn't like anymore. How dare he not be a mind-reader like Rhysand who is a prince among men.Anyway, things between Tamlin and Feyre aren't so great when she gets back. She starts noticing that he's really controlling but they never really sit down and talk about it. She whines about it but never discusses anything with him... and yes, while his behavior isn't great, locking her in the tower is hardly the abusive act that Feyre milked for all it was worth. It was bad, yes, but it's not like Rhysand was free of faults (oh no, we'll be getting to that), and yet his past was wiped so clean it was practically sparkling, while Tamlin's smaller crimes are portrayed as the Greatest Wrongs in the History of Wrongs, and you would think he put her up in some kind of prison camp for all that she goes on about Tamlin locking her up and Rhysand freeing her. IT WAS SO ANNOYING.The ""mate"" thing is really just a neat excuse to forgo any groveling while also explaining this seeming switch mid-series between love interests. We learn that Rhysand sexually assaulted Feyre for her own good, to keep her angry so she wouldn't give up hope. WOW, WHAT A GREAT GUY. About 370-pages in, he finally brings up the assault and sort-of-but-not-really-apologizes and Feyre merely shrugs it off, despite the fact that in book one, everything he did was infuriating and traumatizing to her, and she HATED his guts and HATED him for parading her around and objectifying her in front of Rhysand, drugged her, mind raped her, and even made jokes about forcing herself on her, but yeah, Tamlin's the bad guy because he locked her in her room ONE TIME.It's kind of amazing, really, how eager Feyre was to throw Tamlin in the trash.Also, like Celaena/Aelin in THRONE OF GLASS, it isn't enough for Feyre to be a bad-ass fighter on her own terms, no. When she comes back with the gifts of the other Lords, she comes back with LITERALLY ALL OF THEIR POWERS, and she is so powerful that people are going to kill her just to keep her powers from manifesting. Because a heroine just isn't worth salt if she isn't the Queen of the Specialverse, I guess. Part of what made Feyre so endearing in book one is because she actually did have to struggle to succeed; here, everything is served to her on a silver platter.I skipped over most of the Night Court things... they were so boring.Of course, Tamlin has to become a traitor. Maas basically did to him what she did to Chaol and Dorian in THRONE OF GLASS. They both become terribad people so Rowan can show up and steal the scene with his earth-shattering orgasms. I guess maybe even the author realized that Tamlin didn't look that bad, so making him into a betrayer was necessary for giving Feyre a clean-cut reason to dump his ass without looking petty. Also, apparently he harbors a sexual assaulter in his court, because in this book we learn that YET ANOTHER WOMAN IN THIS BOOK tried to have her way with Rhys without his consent, and Tamlin just keeps her around... because he's the bad guy now.We're supposed to feel sorry for Rhysand because he was Amarantha's ""whore,"" and yes, I do feel sorry for him... Amarantha was awful... but that doesn't excuse his own abuse. ""This is for your own good"" is literally one of the go-to phrases of abusers. He was AWFUL in A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES and he never really grovels for it. He tells Feyre abouthisabuses while crying, but that's all about HIM. He provides plenty of reasons-- excuses-- about why he did what he did, but this serves more to brush off his actions than genuine contrition. I wouldn't even care if he became her love interest as the villain if he was actually KEPT as a villain, but it's like all that brutality gets a pass because he is, in fact, a nice guy. Also, the casual story about what basically serves as an allegory to genital mutilation in his mother's court was super disturbing and mentioned like once, but holy yikes-- his parents were fucked up, and I felt like that should have been unpacked more.Lastly... the mental illness rep. Some people apparently think it's great. No. I don't think it is. Love basically cures Feyre's ills. While it's true that being in an unhealthy relationship can exacerbate existing mental illnesses and cause ones you are predisposed to to manifest, being in a good relationship is not a cure. You don't lose your PTSD or whatever because the sex is good and you've found your soul mate. That is a toxic trope in way too many romances, and I can't stand for it. ALSO, what about Tamlin's PTSD? This was also never really discussed. Does only Feyre get to behave irrationally and have freak outs? That's an unrealistic expectation to have, and her contribution to that toxic relationship was never even discussed... because of course, Feyre is perfect.On second thought, maybe she is perfect for Rhysand. They're both selfish trash people.One of the crowning moments in this book is Feyre saying NOBODY HAS SUFFERED OR GONE HUNGRY LIKE I HAVE while a few chapters before she was hating on Tamlin for literally tithing his people until they starve. I guess she's the High Lady of Virtue Signalling as well. Fuck the poor people if they don't give her an excuse to hate on Tamlin. I don't believe they're mentioned again.If you forget how perfect this couple is, Feyre and Rhysand will remind you 2342342 times why the two of them are the Faerie Jesuses Incarnate who died and prostituted themselves for your sins.This almost reads like bad fanfiction of the first book. I really don't feel like Rhyand and Feyre were destined to be together from the beginning. I felt like maybe Maas initially planned on a love triangle but maybe thought Rhysand was too rough around the edges, and so worked double-time trying to find reasons to excuse all of his behavior and make him supes enamored with the heroine.The greatest death in this series wasn't Junian's or Amarantha's... it was Tamlin's character.It isn't even like Rhysand is perfect in this book. His flirting is literally saying things to Feyre that most men would get slapped for. He talks to her like one of those sexist asshats inMadmen. He's constantly talking about her appearance in a creepy way, and helaughswhen she's upset that he used her as bait for the Attor. Even their bargain, which ended up allowing him to read her mind, was done without consent, and he certainly doesn't ask for consent every time he reads her mind. At one point, he even says that he could rip her mind apart if he wanted. It's almost like this book was written out with the intention of having him still be the villain and Maas changed her mind halfway through.I really couldn't stand this book.Rhysand and Rowan are literally the same person, and their ""development"" with the heroine follows the same trajectory. It's not the worst book I've read, and it's not even the worst Maas book I've ever read, butI will never for the life of me understand why this series is so popular, or why some people who eagerly condemn other books for being problematic seem so eager to forgive or ignore the flaws in this one.Your mileage may vary.1 to 1.5 stars",1
235,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","When I finished this book,the mountains trembled.*Do I need to remind you to be civil? No, I don’t. Good kids.Thanks to my wonderful friendsEmer,ReyesandSarah(click to read their reviews) who helped me up this calvary, with whom I shared joys and sorrows, and who made me laugh so much I probably won't need to swing by the gym for the rest of my life.And a special mention goes toKaterina,NastassjaandVera(again, click and be delighted by snarkiness), who ranted with me in the comments of more than one update.Thank you. <3(I told you reading this book was so much fun.)---➤ The book, in brief:“Stop comparing.Stopcomparing me to him.”Because do you know what it is called when youkeepandkeepandkeepcomparing the previous love interest to the current one, and each single one of thesesugary,clichéd,obviousandtritecomparisons invariably leads to the conclusion that the ex is a prick while the newcomer is a Perfection Milkshake?No, Maas? I thought so.Oh well.I’m going to say this just once: it’s calledmanipulation.Now look at me, Maas. Do I look like a reader who enjoys being manipulated to you?No? Why,I thought so.To all those who still have to start this series and are intentioned to:don’t readA Court of Thornes and Roses. Spoil yourself a little of what happens there andstart with this one. Because -and this is the truly sad thing, as someone else said before me-A Court of Mist and Furycould even be enjoyable if the first book had not happened before.•I won’t go so far as to say that what we have here is a case of lack of “show” and an excess of “tell”, because the first chapters do show that Tamlin, whether for some PTSD or because he has always been a scumbag, undeniably acts like the worst man on the planet. I am even willing to forgive howcaricaturalhis behaviour appears. But, throughout the book, every occasion is a good occasion to throw in a comment tooverturncompletely also all the positive parts of him that are showed in the first book.(In this regard, I should say that inA Court of Thornes and RosesI did not care for Tamlin in any way, so I am not speaking out of frustrated adoration.)In this scenario, Tamlin is the epitome of all evil, while Rhys, of course, the epitome of all good: Tamlin cares for hierarchy, Rhys cares for family and nothing more (ugh); Tamlin wants her caged, Rhys want her free; as it turns out,it was Tamlin’s betrayal to begin the feud between his family and Rhys’s, and so on. I am not in any way saying that a man shouldn’t give freedom to his woman (it’s not that he should;he must, uncompromisingly), or that a plot-twist like the one I mentioned isn’t a good turn of events, even in terms of characterization, but everything is just sostereotypicalandtriteandsickly sweet.All of this,in the name of a ship. I think Maas should understand that falling out of love is just as normal as falling in. People fall out of love for normal reasons even if their exes don’t suddenly turn into maniacs.I am sick of this device, courtesy ofQueen of Shadows, and I don’t need the new love interest to be pushed on me: I am perfectly able to decide for myself.•I’ve seen some reviews in which these two characters are described as complex and multifaceted on the basis of their role reversal. Allow me to say that, in my opinion,nothing about them, in this book, is complex nor controversial.Maas did nothing more than switch their places and their personalities with them: Tamlin was the good one and turns out to be the villain; Rhysand was the villain (somehow, and indeed the Rhysand of the first book is the one I can honestly call intriguing) and now he is nothing short of a Fae Prince Charming.Simple as that.Besides,I liked Rhysandin this book, butI deeply missed the more wicked, morally grey part of himthat we saw Under the Mountain. He’s hot, sure, but he also comes off asflatand, at times,pathetic.•It was a dick moveto lock Feure up in the mansion, yes. And yet, I can’t wrap my mind around Feyre’s fickleness, considering thattwo chapter latershe says this:“I'm thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing-thing? Now he’s a thing?-that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I'm thinking maybe he knew that- maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn't work for who- what I am now.""She hadevery rightto leave the mansion and let him stew for a while, but if that is the result of months and months of undying love, well. He stopped being worth of her love maybe, but I don’t think she fought for it that hard either, especially if he really was dealing with some PTSD. I think love is also about trying to fight for the other person even when they don’t seem to fight for us, to give them time, to give them chances, even though at one point we have to stop.It just would have been nicer and more enjoyable if Feyre’s affection’s shift hadn’t been so swift, that’s it.•All the contradictions. Feyre leave her abusive boyfriend, but then falls in the arms of a man who breaks every bone of a guy who called her names. Uh-uh. And if you say “He did that because he called her ‘whore’, and he’d been called whore too, and thetrauma”, I say: how do you know Tamlin’s behaviour wasn’t due to his trauma too. Maybe he just needed time. But it’s okay if it’s Rhysand that does that because epitome-of-perfection, remember?Hisbeing all possessive is okay. He can say things like “She’s mine” and snarl at people who so much as look at her. And don’t get me started on indecent exposure.•Thenew charactersare all nice and pretty and invariably haunted by a dark dark past. It’s nice to read about them and to witness their banters, but they don’t stand out as particularly well-written or sophisticated.•Theplotis evenweakerthan Maas’s usual. And contrary to what I usually do, I’ll sum it up for you: Feyre flees. TheMy Little Ponies gang- ops. I meant the Court of Dreams’ defenders (I know, the ponies were cooler) look for Things. Which do Stuff. Precisely, destroy Taran’s Black Cauldron and defeat The Horned King, minus the fluffy Gurgi.Well, wrong story, but that's basically what happens.In more than 600 pages.•People purr. Normal cats, thank God, ordinarily talk like freaking civilized beings.•The first timeRhysand and Feyre have sex and he climaxes, the mountains tremble. I refuse to comment on this thing, and if it was me who had written such embarrassing idiocy, I would be hiding my head under the sand. Moreover, allthe sex scenesare verycheesy,dramaticandover-written.•Lucien andElain’s mating bond. I swear on my heart I have never, ever read anything more ridiculous than this scene (oh, no, wait: the mountains). The passage from normal, rational person to mad caveman takes less time than a spark to burn. I almost expected he started hissing “My preciousss”.•And yet,I enjoyed it, or better, I enjoyedRhys,Rhys, his long, sappy, tearydeclaration/explanation(I have a thing for this trope; it could have been a thousand times worse than it actually is, and still I would've loved it. I am such a softie, I know. My fault), theending, andRhys. The other things I pretty much despised. I also appreciate the fact that at least the author tried –and at some length, I think, even succeeded a tiny bit- to conceive a scenario in which Rhys’s cuddliness actually makes some sense.I still prefer him wicked.➽ To sum it up, what can I say? I read it with with ease because of an extremely fluent, even though not particularly sophisticated, writing style, and, as we all know, idiocies and mushy stuff can also be enjoyable, and truly, this book take the concept ofguilty pleasureto a whole new level. Nonetheless, I am sorry, but I can't overcome theirritationthat Maas's little games cause in me. She used the same lame and unprofessional trick twice now; my trust in her is gone, and I'm wondering if we should expect a third time too.EDIT29/03/16: Ok, so I read the excerpt -as usual, unforgivably late, but this time the delay is due to the fact that I didn't know whether to read it or not. If you want to join the club, you can find ithere.What do I think of it? I simply think that making a protagonist goOOCwith three plain lines does take an inconceivable amount of talent. Because apparently the wholeQueen of Shadowsmess wasn't enough.Respect, Maas. Really.EDIT14/01/16:*braces herself for the incoming tomatoes*I don't like the cover!*runs away as fast as she can*",2
236,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","LET ME START MY REVIEW BY QUOTING MY PRE-REVIEW, THE ONE THAT I WROTE BEFORE THIS BOOK CAME OUT:Written in September 2015:Now that I've read Queen of Shadows I don't know what to expect from this one. I AM SCARED. I'm totally open to the whole Feyre/Rhys thing, but I love Tamlin so much and I don't want him to be ruined by Sarah J. Maas! Can someone please tell her that she can make us love a character without ruining another character?Because really, I ship Feyre and Tamlin, but I will not be mad if SJM handles Rhys's and Feyre's relationship with cleverness.PLEASE SJM, DON'T RUIN TAMLIN....And of course, WHAT DID SJM DO? RUIN TAMLIN!I tried to write my review without major plot spoilers, but there will be some minor spoilers about how the characters were handled. And warning: my emotions over this book are a mess, you'll se how contrary they are!Anyway... let me begin:OH, I was mad! I was so angry when I started reading this book, because it is in the first chapter that you notice that Tamlin has changed and not for good. Now he's an asshole. He's insensitive and controlling, I couldn't stand him! So congrats, SJM, you made me despise my (now former) favorite character in this series.I read a few reviews that said that Tamlin was always like that (a possessive piece of shit), but NO. HE WASN'T! He was caring and protective, not a control freak. I feel that Tamlin changed because of everything that happened with Amarantha. Everyone comments on how Feyre had PTSD and Tamlin didn't try to understand her, but I think Tamlin also had PTSD. What he went through with Amarantha (and with almost losing Feyre) had a huge toll in him. I can accept that he changed because of that, but no one acknowledges it, not the readers, not Feyre, not even SJM.So that must mean that he just changed because he's an asshole (I'm not buying it).My problem is that SJM wanted to force Rhysand on us, like she wanted to force Rowan on us in her Throne of Glass series. Excuse me, miss, but I don't need the love interest to be pushed on me. I can decide by myself. And the thing is... I FELL IN LOVE WITH RHYS IN THIS BOOK! And I think I would've fallen for him even if Tamlin hadn't been the piece of shit he was.Before this book, I couldn't imagine any possible reason that would make Feyre leave Tamlin and fall for Rhys. Not after everything she went through to save Tam, he was the love of her life and her feelings for him were genuine. But then of course, the author put a lot of effort in ruining Tamlin, just so Feyre could fall out of love. What SJM doesn't seem to understand is that falling out of love is normal. It's perfectly fine. You don't have to turn a character into a bad guy for that to happen. Sarah turned Tam into a villain, and that was not necessary.I also hated the comparisons Feyre was always making between Rhys and Tam, so frustrating! They were so obviously put there only to make sure that the reader understood that Tamlin was evil and Rhysand was good:-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn't let me go anywhere. But Rhys lets me do anything I want!""-""Ugh, I had my nightmares and Tamlin never woke up to confort me. But Rhys is always there for me when that happens!""-""Ugh, Tamlin only cares about hierarchy. But Rhys cares about family and about his people!""-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn't let me enter to his room. But of course Rhys invites me to his!""...I MEAN, SERIOUSLY? We can notice that by ourselves, but Feyre kept comparing and comparing during the whole book.Have you read the Shatter Me series? It was as if Feyre was Juliette, Tamlin was Adam and Rhysand was Warner... the very same pattern! First Tamlin was a cinnamon roll and suddenly he becomes a bad guy who only thinks about himself and is obsessed with Feyre. And Rhys was the evil guy in the first book but then you discover that he had really good reasons to do everything he did, and he's a good guy incapable of commiting any evil. Gosh, I really liked Tamlin, but now I simply can't stand him. SJM succeeded!And I had other issues with this book... but that was my main one. I'm afraid this has become the modus-operandi of SJM.Let me talk about those other issues... starting with Rhys. His character really intrigued me in the first installment of this series, he seemed evil, and I knew there was more in him than what he let us see. I knew he had his reasons to act the way he did, and of course I wanted to know why. BUT THIS WAS JUST RIDICULOUS. He's not justnot evil, he istoogood, bordering in perfection. He's a saint, he's ""Saint Rhys"". There is too much goodness in him. He's also the ""most powerful Fae ever born"", see? It's unnatural to be that perfect.Another issue was that Rhys seems to be the only High Lord that cares about peace and prosperity. He's literally the only one trying to stop the King. The other High Lords don't care about humans! The other High Lords are stupid! I feel like SJM did this just to add more perfection to Rhysand's character: Obviously he's the only considerate Fae that cares about the poor humans, the other High Lords are nothing compared to him!Now let's go to the other side of my review (this will be drastic): Despite eveything, I LOVE RHYS SO MUCH! UGH, SARAH! You did it, you made me fall in love with him! Maybe it's his good nature. Maybe it's his perfection. Maybe it's because he reminds me of Warner. I don't care anymore... I'm just really rooting for him. I don't know how Sarah does it. Even with everything that bothers me about his character, I couldn't help falling for him.And it is rare when I change my ship in a series, but I did in this one because there's no way I'd still ship Feyre and Tamlin after everything that happened in this book (which is sad, because I really shipped them in the first book). Now I can only say that I ship Feyre and Rhys SO. MUCH. Their relationship development was beautiful, everything they went through made their love more real, made it stronger. There is no love triangle here, there are no teams, there are simply Feyre and Rhys and I NEED them to be together.There were only two things I didn't like about their relationship. 1)The whole: I DREAMT ABOUT YOU BEFORE I MET YOU....Cliché, cliché, cliché. 2) The ""YOU ARE MINE"" parts. I mean, Feyre left Tamlin because he was possesive and controlling, but all those ""you are mine"" are not exactly different, right? I don't like that kind of love. It should not be about belonging to someone, it should be about belonging together.I also love Cassian and Azriel. Everything that happened at the end with them made me a sobbing mess! I just hope Cassian recovershis poor wings!, because if not, I'll just go to a corner and cry forever.Now let's talk about Feyre. Sometimes she infuriated me because of all the comparisons she made and because she was always complaining about Tamlin not trying to understand her, but she didn't really try to understand him, either. Sometimes she was really unfair with himExcept when he locked her up, I would've done the same thing Feyre did. AND NO, I don't want them back together (NEVER), it's just that she made me really mad sometimes. But in contrast, I think she really grew as a character in this book, she blew me away! The scene with the water wolves was AMAZING. AlsoI cried when the evil creatures attacked Velaris! Ugh, stupid queens!!!...I couldn't stand it, it was painful to read. But back to Feyre, I like the directon her character is going.I can't wait to read the next installment! I know Tamlin doesn't have a chance of forgiveness (I myself can't ever forgive him), but I'd like to see redemption in Lucien, he's a character with great potential and in this book he was just too weak.The world building was great, a total A+! I'm still a little confused about the whole Jurian ordeal, but I hope he gets killed soon :). All in all, this book was GREAT, I think that maybe it was better than the first one, and that's saying a lot, because I loved ACOTAR. But since I had way too much issues with it, I could not give it 5 stars. I don't know how Sarah does it... she makes me love her and hate her in every book she writes! But it's more love than hate, I am SJM trash. She's QUEEN.",3
237,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","I've never been thismanipulatedin my life.I was stripped off my free will until there was only a shell left behind, a puppet complying with her master's whim. This is the most vulgar thingSarah J. Maascould do.Allow me to elaborate.•In order to be candid, I have to admit thatI enjoyedA Court of Mist and Furymore than I expected, and found some redeeming traits that prevented me from rating it lower. However, I can't hide my rage and utter disappointment sinceeverything we read inA Court of Thorns and Rosesvanished into thin air. Remember the sweet love story between Tamlin and Feyre that defied immortal tyrants and resulted in great sacrifices in the name of their love? Well, forget about it. We were warned that this would be aHades and Persephone retelling, meaning the romantic relationship between Feyre and Rhysand would be inevitable. The way, though, Sarah handled the transition wasfeebleandinfuriatingto say the least. I don't think there has ever been a character moremistreatedthan Tamlin, with Lucien following suit. We get it, Sarah cares about her precious baby Rhysand, but her real talent as an author would be to make me choose him because I found something unique in him,not because she forced him down my throat. Tamlin's inexcusable behaviour suffocated Feyre, and I felt drowning and suffocating along with her. Since I couldn't possibly wish for her to stay in a mentally abusive relationship, Rhysand was the deus ex machina, the only one to save the damsel in distress, given that her friends abandoned her and her fiance suffered from split personality. Sarah dangled Rhysand in front of me, and every reader, sayingpick him pick him pick him. She had Tamlin and Rhysand facingidenticalsituations, only for Tamlin to do the wrong thing while precious Rhysand was the impersonation of right, of all that's good in the world. Tamlin locked Feyre? Rhysand set her free. Tamlin forbid Feyre from participating in his activities? Rhysand would always have her by his side. Tamlin extinguished the fire burning in Feyre and left her a hollow version of herself? Rhysand fueled that fire, and so on, so on. Now, I've been on the losing side of a triangle before, but always both love interests had some good qualities. In this case, though, Sarah served you the answer on a silver platter by annihilating the opponent and erasing everything that made the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin good and healthy. Rhysand was always sothoughtfulandconsiderateand knew what Feyre needed, he was her salvation. Of course he was, there was afreaking magic bondbetween them that allowed him to read her thoughts. Even the lesser fae servant in the Day Court would understand her needs if they were bonded. In every chapter she would chantRhysand is so gorgeous,Rhysand is so sexy,Rhysand is the most powerful High Lord in the history of Prythianyada yada.We.Get.It.Don't even get me started on the repetition of the wordmate, I rolled my eyes so many times I fear I might have a permanent problem.•Lucien losing his backbone and Tamlin turning into a psycopath a-hole were not the only character mistreatments, though.Rhysand was the victim of his own creator's adoration.In order to make him the perfect match for Feyre, she made himtoo perfect. Gone is the wicked, morally grey, complex character that intrigued us inA Court of Thorns and Roses. While unveilingthisRhysand, instead of finding shadows and darkness and lust for power, we found asappyand fluffy bear asking for love and affection. Everything he did was out oflovefor his friends, for Feyre and his country, and I fail to accept his reasoning behind his actions Under the Mountain. If you don't want the villain to know how you feel about Feyre, you can simply ignore her. But no, why not drug her, grop her while drugged and humiliate her instead?•Now let's get to the relationship between Feyre and Rhysand. For more than the first half of the book I liked them, with their banters and flirtation and the pent-up tension. But from attraction and friendship Feyre suddenly jumped to declarations of love and thenmountains trembledand she startedglowingand their sex scenes varied between steamy to cringe-worthy and more eye-rolling ensued (I seriously need to see an ophthalmologist).•Plotwise, I can't help but notice that some things were veryconvenient. You suspect the King of Hybern is preparing for war? Let's ask the monstrous ancient creature, who in the span of five minutes will give us all the answers, including the means to defeat the King and the exact location of the weapons to nullify his powers. Wanna convince the mortal queens to give you what you need? Write a mushy letter about your love for Feyre. The result is guaranteed. I mean, really?•Why three stars then, you may wonder. Well,I became very fond of the secondary characters. Mor, Azriel, Cassian and the ultimate Queen, Amren, were funny and caring and loyal, and I was actually more invested in their stories (which, to be honest, were all sob stories). I also enjoyed Sarah'slush descriptions, you could feel and breathe and walk the streets of Velaris, and the Summer Court. But most importantly, I admire the way Feyre's trauma from her experiences Under the Mountain was depicted. The guilt, the sorrow, the self-loathing were tangible, and the healing was slow and realistic. Her wounds would be there, and she learned to live with them. Feyre became a strong woman who embraced her gifts, her powers, her sensuality and ferociously claimed her place alongside men. She rose from her ashes.“When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.”•A Court of Mist and Furyhad great potential, but I can't say I loved it. I'm partially sad because I lost some of my respect for Sarah, for shredding to pieces the characters I loved only to show her own favorites are better. I don't know whether I'll readA Court of Wings and Ruin. Before the last chapters it was a big no, but that final confrontation was the book's highlight for me and now I'm considering to dwelve into the third instalment to find out the end of this story-arc.To all my friends who loved this book, and I know there are many of you, please don't be harsh on me. The magic of reading is precisely the fact that we all read the same book but get something different from it. ❤️You can findthis reviewand more over atBookNest.eu!",3
238,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","Let's pretend this is Starfall and I have more than 5 ⭐ to giveThis book’s song mood match –Nocturnal by Elle VeeFull review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺“To the stars who listen – and the dreams that are answered.”How dares Sarah J. Maas??How dare you, lady?? How dare you destroy me like that and then drink cups full of my salty tears like they are fine wine?? What kind of fucked up sadistic witchy ritual is this for you?You annihilate me with your cruel imagination. And because I’m a masochist, I love it. Keep going queen, I love this kind of pain.So, I couldn’t have picked a better time to read this but the quarantine time; all I did all day was reading this; I was being transported to this amazing world that I want to be part of right now – the Night Court is my eternal home from now on.“Stay here for however long you want. Stay here forever, if you feel like it.”It helped my mental health so much I am at a lack of words to express my gratitude.When I was younger, I used to read a lot of mythological stories and even though the Greek mythology confused the hell out of me, I had this fascination for some badass ladies. Amongst them were Persephone and her story. Yes, my cheesy heart loved that, okay?Persephone was the Bride of Spring, but she was stolen by the God of the Underworld – the terrible Hades – because he was head-over-heels in love with her. But she hated him with all her being until…she didn’t anymore. She learned to love his weird-ass too until he became her husband.If this isn’t the literary world’s foundation for their enemies-to-lovers theme, then I don’t know what this is, I give up.Well, this is the exact thing that happens inA Court of Mist and Fury. Rhys gets to be Hades (duh, obvy!) and Feyre is our darling Persephone. My brain started producing serotonin once again because of that tiny little fact some now happy beyond compare.This book is a love statement. Falling in love – slowly, truly, deeply, madly in love. And hard. But heart-crying beautiful. And it is not only about two beautiful creatures learning how to love each other and all the states they get through to find that love.This book teaches of how to fall in love with beautiful people, beautiful faces, beautiful minds and beautiful souls. And most importantly, how to fall in love with yourself. How to cherish everything you get to have in order to know how to soothe your life and spirit.“But then she snapped your neck.”Tears rolled down his face.“And I felt you die”, he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.“And this beautiful, wonderful thing that had come into my life, this gift from the Cauldron…It was gone.”Don’t get confused though. This is still a Maas work of art and thus it is still very, very extremely hot. I can’t manage to launch into an explanation of how hot this book is because it is on fire, okay? And with this, SJM makes out of this book a full emotional experience (an emotional roller coaster better said but oh well).All of my favourite characters from this series make an appearance in this book. If you thought you loved the characters you encountered in the first book, then wait to be blown away by the apparition of the Inner Circle. They’re precious, deadly soft babies that I would want nothing more in life for them but to be fed, warm, cuddled and loved.-Cassianis the ruffian of my heart, he’s big and loud and gives off this feeling that he’ll keep you happy and safe no matter what; just love him so much;-Azrielis the baby-bat-guardian-angel of my soul whom I love so much and all I want to do in life is hug him and feed him and protect him from everything and everyone;-Amrenis a scary old bitch whom I love for the simple fact that she doesn’t seem to give a fuck about anyone but she’ll be ready to defend her friends if it comes to it;-Moris my girl-crush of this series and sometimes I think she’ll be my ultimate wine-drinking bestie; I love her to death;“A queen – a queen who bowed to no one, a queen who had faced them all down and triumphed. A queen who owned her body, her life, her destiny and never apologized for it.”All those weirdos are like a big, fat present for me, wrapped up in colourful paper and with a bow tied on top. I don’t know how I managed to go on with my life before I learned about their existence.Now, moving on to more serious, adult-like topics, I want to confess one thing: this book is extremely sensual. It really goes places and I went with it like in trance. The level of sexiness explored here is so intense that it could be made a masterpiece of sensually falling in love. And this is mainly because ofRhys.In this book, I honestly cared more about Rhys than I cared about all of the characters inA Court of Thorns and Roses. He is the sexiest thing I’ve ever encountered in my life and with this, I have discovered, he’s my type of man, no questions asked.“I have known many High Lords. Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”It feels like he’s having his own personalised gravitational system and we simply happen to fly around like thebăgători-de-seamăthat we are, if I’m allowed to express myself as Romanian as possible.Rhysand and Feyre's falling in love journey is one of the most beautiful love stories this world could read about. It is so warm, but also so crushing. I love it. It’s like a most beautifully painted love dream.By the end ofthis– *vaguely gesturing towards everything ACOMAF is*– I felt tired, hurt and blurry-sighted. And truth be said, a bitsobby(a bit more). I’ve been hurt to my core.But I loved this book so much, honestly.

I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.❞A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of the first books I started reading that got me into Fantasy and reviewing books. Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn't hyped up like there's no tomorrow. It was the first book I've read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life.I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven't picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it's been released. That's just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn't say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books.I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF?Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas's books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn't worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn't written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn't some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn't going to happen. These two people that survived weren't the same people that were Under the Mountain. They're relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre's own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don't acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn't protect her the way he wanted and he didn't fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she's being suffocated. It still doesn't excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he's just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He's just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he's kept, and the sacrifices he's made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I'm not completely sure if I'm 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would've been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn't get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I'm slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little.With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters.Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can't handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin.Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J. Maas was taking the series. Love her or hate her, Sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. Although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, I think A Court of Mist and Fury was even better than ACOTAR in more ways than one. Sometimes I find that sequels may suffer ""middle book syndrome"" but ACOMAF amplifies that momentum knowing that Sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy.",5
240,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.Oh damn. That was so unexpectedly good. And to think I almost didn't take a chance on this after not loving the first book...So, here it is: I present to you7 reasons why this book is a million times better thanA Court of Thorns and Roses.1) Less romance.Oh, don't worry, there's romance. There'slusty, slow-build, flirtatious romancethat somehow manages to be completely absent from the first book, even though romance was more central to the plot. But there's also so many other things here. It's a fantasy with romantic elements, not the other way around.I always say I tend to become more invested in love stories when they're subplots and the book itself is not actuallyaboutthe love story. I like it when the characters come together around and between all the rest of the action and drama. That's what's happening here. Because there is a whole shitstorm of other things going on - which, by the way, has led tobetter world-building, more exciting action and reveals, and a fascinating overarching story.2) Feyre's growth and development.And, in fact, the growth and development of many characters. Maas spends some quality time on character histories and backstory to strengthen our understanding of them. I absolutely love it when characters show realistic growth over time and I think that's especially important with Feyre here.Feyre is not the character she was duringA Court of Thorns and Roses. How could she be after the events of that book? Naturally, she has changed and found that her needs and aspirations have changed too. Once upon a time, back when she was weak and starving, she longed for a strong protector like Tamlin. Now she is strong, and she needs freedom to train her newfound strengths.3) I hate Tamlin.Honestly, if you happen to be a diehard Tamlin fan, I can see this book being a huge disappointment. Luckily for me, I pretty much despised him. He's never been anything but apretty-faced control freak. I'm glad Feyre has seen that and rebelled against it.I should warn you that Tamlin is absent for about 70-80% of this book. And that was just fine by me!4) I love Rhysand.I foresee the ""oh no, it's a love triangle"" comments rolling in, but I really don't think it is. I actually think this is a great book aboutgrowing up and discovering that you're a different personwho longs for different things. I don't get the sense that Maas is trying to play out the Tamlin/Feyre/Rhysand angst; she is merely showing a young woman having a change of heart.AND can we just talk about how much better Rhysand is. There's all the superficial stuff like he'sexciting, flirty, dangerousand I love the story behind him. He's more fun than Tamlin and I like fun. His banter is wonderful. But I'm also talking about a more important level. Rhysand is, despite being the ""bad boy"", thoughtful and selfless. He doesn't want to stifle Feyre's strength and lock her away for her own protection - he wants her at his side, an equal, a partner in crime. And I love that so much.I like men who see value in strong women.5) Less sexual.I'm sorry, you horny readers, but I just need to put this out there:I really dislike Maas' sex scenes. Maybe Tamlin had something to do with it but, in general, I think they're overwritten and melodramatic. I also think she does a lot of ""telling"" you that it's hot, instead of ""showing"" how it is, which is a common writing mistake, but is far worse when in a sex scene. It's unconvincing.And by ""overwritten"", I mean that she describes kissing as ""branding"", thrusts as ""breaking"", and sex moans as ""prayers"". Literally none of those things are sexy. She gets the flirtations and banter right - that bit is hotter than the actual sex - but I start to cringe when the clothes come off.A brush of his tongue against the seam of my lips had me opening fully for him, and he swept in, claiming me, branding me.Also, is it really necessary for the male characters to ""growl in approval"" during sex? Not just once - and arguably one growl is one too many - but several times. I'm supposed to be fanning myself with desire and all I can think about isRoy Orbison's Pretty Woman.Mercy. Rawr.6) New characters.A Court of Mist and Furyintroduces many new characters, and the difference between this book and the first is that I found them all memorable, not just the main three characters. Maas has definitely not neglected her characterization and character detailing here. Everyone who comes in and out of the novel has an important purpose, is fleshed out with personality and history, and makes an impact.My favourite was Amren, but I also loved Cassian and Azriel. Our brief introductions to the Bone Carver and the Weaver were highlights too.7) The ending.Take note: this is how to ensure your reader needs to get their hands on the next book. It's not a cliffhanger, but it is still EVIL. In the best possible way. I loved everything about it. It's the kind of emotional high that leaves you somewhere between wide-eyed horror and smiling gleefully.How will I last a whole year?Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Store",4

Rowling are somewhere sipping tea, and laughing at this bullshit.So, I've skimmed through the entire book, i still have no clue why this is so popular.-A Court of blah blah is boring as hell.-Characters are infuriating, and tiresome.They possess no unique or remarkable qualities. Quite on the contrary actually.I think we all agree, it's just plain wrong if a middle-aged man tries to get into a teenager's pants.

Don't look at me, I'm not the one who wrote it.-The writing was monotonous. I don't even want to think about this.-Plot... was there any?Whatever it was, i found it painfully predictable.-Surely I can't be the only one who finds the term ""mate"" utterly ridiculous. I was dying laughing every time it was mentioned. Just couldn't take it seriously. Sorry, not sorry. There also seems to be a new trend in SJM's book. I wonder what goes on in her head.

If he is her ""mate"" no one will dare question me. *pats her own back* I really am a genius!-I called all of those ""shocking"" twists before the book was even out.

I understand how people would consider the sequel to be an improvement since the main character shows more agency and certain tropes are reversed, but the development was very on-the-nose and came at the expense of turning other characters into cartoonish villains. The writing suffered a lot from telling and not showing, especially when it came to the dialogue, where it mostly consisted of the main character asking questions which would result in the other faeries answering via several pages of monologues in order to tell the exposition and characters’ background stories. This would be fine if I cared about anything in the book at all, but I don’t. People hyped this book up to be some trashy erotica, but there were only 2 sex scenes towards the end; otherwise, the book is just a very boring fantasy story.",1

I just want to fill this review up with the heart-eye emojis.Minor spoilers will be included. You've been warned.This book is incredible. This book is important. But before I get to that, this book was a massive, gigantic improvement on ACOTAR. They're not even the same two books. Or they are, but ACOMAF elevated this series to what it deserved and needed to be.The world was epic, detailed and grand and I never wanted to leave. Everything about it clicked. I was absolutely transported into a world that I became obsessed and enthralled with. The pacing was beautifully slow, but well paced and the build up was great.So, the story line picks up right where it left off, with Feyre and Tamlin being back in the Spring Court, and now having to suffer from PTSD and anxiety. I absolutely love how SJM explored this and showcased how they were both affected by what happened in the events of the last book.Now, I was afraid that Tamlin's character was going to be completely bashed and written off since readers were hating on him and since I really liked his character in ACOTAR, that had me worried. But as I read on, the progression with his character made sense. As much as I loathed how he became, it's understandable and true to real life. His PTSD took on a different form. Sadly, that form became more emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling. It was almost unbearable to even read. It was ugly but it needed to be there.Feyre just lost herself. She didn't know who she was anymore. Her trauma unfolded in a way that changed her completely and led her to who she truly needed to become.I absolutely loved how SJM incorporated those aspects into the story and how Feyre grew and continued to beautifully grow throughout the book. Facing setbacks, but ultimately, finding herself and her voice again. That 'human' element made it so relatable and warm. And the depth that SJM went into for both characters was impressive and you couldn't help but be invested and feel a strong sense of empathy.But what I loved more than anything was that SJM showed what a healthy and unhealthy relationship is. What to stand and not to stand for, depending on the standards you've set for yourself and which ultimately, you decide for yourself. 'Twas fuckin feminist as fuck, whilst also incorporating what true friendship and a healthy and loving relationship can do for your worth. To ultimately put your wellbeing ahead of everything so you may recognise the signs of an imbalanced relationship.And Rhysand? I need him in human form. Sometime soon, universe.This book just has so many fantastical and realistic elements to it. I loved that we were able to take something a way from it, enjoy it, and I'm even happier that SJM decided to extend this series. I mean, more Rhysand, amirite?!------------------------------Original review:Wow. Wow. Wow.How the fuck does one even write a review for this?!My mind has been obliterated.I'm done.",5
254,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","""When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.""Yall... this book... this book and its hype... this book and its hype and all it's spoilers; had me worried. On top of all that I feared that this book, all 600 plus pages, would suffer a massive case of second book syndrome. I'm so freaking happy to finally say that this book was AMAZING!As I do with most my on-going series reviews I'm going to keep this review spoiler free. Since this book was broken up in several sections I'm going to basically break my review down by that.A Court of Mist and Furyis the second book in theA Court of Throns and Rosesseries. This book starts off right where ACOTAR ended. Feyre, however, isn't recovering well from what happened to her under the mountain. It doesn't help that Tamlin basically avoids talking about it at all cost and he insist that she never leaves the estate. Being trapped in the house just wedding planning, with no friends, no family, and waiting for the moment when Rhys comes to claim her for their deal. Feyre is a broken girl the first part of this book. Not knowing where she stands or where she wants to be. So many things happen in the first half of this book, all leading up to Rhys finally coming to get her. That's all I'm really going to say about the first section of this book.The next part of this book we finally get a lot of the answers we've been dying for! Answers about Rhys and why he is the way he is, we finally get to see the Night Court, we get to find out so much history on all the other courts, and oh so much more. We are also introduced to so many new side characters... Which easily became some of my all time favorites. Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel brought everything to this story! I loved that Rhys decides to surround himself with the best of the best, say F the people who don't see females as badass, and puts two fierce girls as part of his inner circle. Cassian and Azriel, be still my beating heart. I loved these two. What interesting characters. Each with such a unique back story. This part of the book was all about build up and setting the stage for the ending. This is why it took me awhile to get through this book... but trust me get through it, its so wroth it.The last part of this book... God give me strength! I don't know how I'm even going to get through the rest of this review. This section of the book was everything I ever wanted! There is action, suspense, romance, history, and twist. Everything that was building up from the first parts were perfect set up for this to be a big bang. There were also so many things that I thought were minor details in the first book that turned out to be huge reveals in this one. I was also so worried that the ""love triangle"" aspect still hanging in the air that it would end up ruining things for me. I can't not address it, and I swear it's not a spoiler, but allthe romance in this is PERFECT. It's also why this book is so much bigger than the first, because it's so full of sexy fun times.This book is hot, HOT! I really don't get how this book is still categorized as Ya, I think this jumped right into NA. Seriously, so yummy! I have for sure gotten on the same ship as everyone else.The ending. So much happens. It was so amazing. Shit hits the fan! I did not see it coming. I knew one thing that was going to happen, because you can't not see it, but the rest of it had me on the edge of my seat. I kept screaming ""WTF"" The whole time. Like really, what just happened?!?! Those last two chapters though. Those last two chapters were.... Lord! Oh and that last paragraph! That last sentence!!!! Lets just say it was the most epic!!!I wish my review was a little more detailed, and sorry if it's all over the place, but that's how this book made me feel. A messy, disorganized, and a hot mess. I can't wait till book three.",5
255,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","This is exactly how you develop a healthy relationship. This is why my bro Rhys is such an likeable character. He respected every wish and need Feyre had, every choice she made, gave her the space and the time she needed to heal, but at the same time he pushed her to grow and thrive. Feyre was always an equal to him.We have no choice but to stan.",5
256,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","Well, well, well. How the turns have tabled.ACOTAR was, uh...not my favorite book in the world.But there are no words to describe how much better ACOMAF is.All the problems I had with the first book were fixed. The story got bigger and more epic. The romance improved dramatically. And I fell in love with all the characters.This review has spoilers for the first book. Spoilers for ACOMAF will be boxed off with siren emojis (🚨).After the events Under the Mountain, Feyre is understandably traumatized. She saved Tamlin and the Spring Court at the cost of her own mental health. She had to kill innocent Fae to save him. And now she can't look at the color red without getting flashbacks. She wakes up every night to throw up.And Tamlin isn't helping.He's extremely protective of her after Amarantha killed her, even though Feyre was brought back stronger than ever as a High Fae. He doesn't allow her to talk to her family or to leave Spring Court land. He goes as far as to lock her in the house so she won't try to help the recovery effort in Prythian.And that's when she breaks. She calls out for anyone to save her, and Rhysand hears her through the bond, taking her to the Night Court to ride out the storm. But along the way, she realizes that she is more than a figurehead. She has powers, given to her by the High Lords when her body was remade. This book is essentially Feyre's journey to finding and accepting herself with Rhysand's help.Rhysand, High Lord of the Night Court, is not as he seems. In ACOTAR, we saw the facade he put on so Amarantha didn't get suspicious. But the real Rhys is a haunted, traumatized character who hates himself and feels worthless. He's exactly like Feyre. An excuse for Rhysand's past behavior is given, and it actually makes sense.Their journey to discovering themselves is beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking. And while I do hate Tamlin for being so heartless to Feyre, I can see where he's coming from and I don't think we should treat him like a villain.He's protective of Feyre because he saw her die, and he's absolutely terrified of that happening again. So he protects her the only way he knows how--by shutting her inside and not letting anyone see her. And it drives Feyre mad. I think there should have been a Tamlin redemption arc, and I really want to see Tamlin recovering from his PTSD as well. Because they're both suffering and they both deserve help. I don't want Tamlin to become the villain.However, the signs of emotional abuse and possible physical abuse are clearly evident.- Claws come out whenever Feyre confronts him- Makes her PTSD worse by locking her inside, giving her flashbacks to Under the Mountain- Doesn't take her opinions seriously- Doesn't listen to her, or kisses her or something to make her shut up- Gives her no responsibilitiesThe mental health rep was outstanding. Tamlin's rep was kind of harmful, but Feyre's was so raw and emotional and real.She didn't recover from her trauma because of love.She recovered because of friendship, and because people actually listened to her and took her seriously. Love was just a side effect.It's really the little things that helped. Feyre comforting Rhys during his nightmares and realizing that they were alike. Mor wearing blue instead of her favorite color (red) when she first meets Feyre. The Court of Dreams giving Feyre time to recover when she has a panic attack.The one thing I think this book needs is more diversity. Everyone was white except for this one guy that showed up for two chapters. The caucacity.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS AHEAD🚨🚨🚨I did not like Rhysand's character after Feyre discovered the mating bond.This may have something to do with the fact that I don't like the idea of ""mates."" They're essentially soulmates, if you're not familiar with SJM. I always felt uncomfortable with the overprotectiveness that comes with the term and the kind of animalistic ring to the word itself.I actually really, really loved Rhys's character before he and Feyre were mates. He was so suave and intelligent and witty. That is, until the mating bond snapped into place. And then he was insanely overprotective and I just don't like that in a character.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨🚨🚨Another rap, because why not.

257,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","MIND=BLOWNMy hysteria is threatening to break me and I wonder if it is possible to die of elation. I'm frozen in 35646 layers of disbelief and I'm trying hard not to explode from the sheer impossibility of this flawless story I've read. I read, read, read, and read until I reached the Acknowledgements page and knew for sure that I finished the best book I've read in like... an eternity.The story is simple, really. It picks up right where it left off inA Court of Thorns and Roses.Feyre is living in the Summer court and is going to marry Tamlin. But things have changed since she has turned into High Fae, an immortal body but with a human heart: She has to stay by Tamlin's side and be his trophy, left with nothing to do but paint and plan her wedding with Tamlin, High Lord of the Spring Court. As she grapples with the horrors she's had to endure Under The Mountain against Amarantha, she also awaits Rhysand, with whom she struck a bargain to visit his Night Court for one week every month.A Court of Mist and Furywas magical. Angsty. AndDamnably beautiful.Theplotwas so tangible, I didn't want to get it over with. Theromancewas so tantalizing, I felt my heart pound frantically in my chest. Theambiencewas soalluring, I struggled to take my eyes off it. And thetwistswere sounexpected, I was forced to gawk and stare at the ceiling, due to relief or stupefaction, I don't know. I was thoroughly enchanted in a world filled with intrigue, magic, lies, and secrets and I feel weighed down by the depth of it.Sarah J. Maas's writing is the literal definition ofmagnificent.She creates a world so captivating and lets you drown in waves ofwonderand intrigue,enigmaand appeal. Her words are powerful, heavy with conviction, articulate, and relevant. I can't thank her enough for delivering this masterpiece and much more. And for introducing me to two of the best characters I can't stop fangirling over.Rhysand.High Lord of the Night Court; Beautiful, brutal, and powerful. He appears to be cold and arrogant initially, occasionally cracking jokes about his beauty. He is surrounded by an aura of sensuality and vivacity and he handles even the direst of situations with grace, casually yet courteously. He is as dangerous and ferocious as he is subtle and generous. He hides behind a mask of savagery and manipulation, trickery and deception but beneath the mask, he's kind and humble, a High Lord who cares for his people more than he deigns to express.Feyre.Our strong protagonist who develops from being oblivious in the first book to someone who didn't need to be coddled, pampered or protected, who didn't cravestabilityandcomfort, orluxuryandeasiness. She hates being judged based on her human life. She can be compassionate, affectionate, and loving, but she can also be vicious, seductive, and cunning as she sees fit. Extremely short-tempered and sometimes provocative, she makes for her shortcomings by being powerful, warm, and unbelievably loyal (Ironic, as she keeps calling herself atraitor)I really liked Tamlin inA Court of Thorns and RosesI thought I'd be devastated by not seeing him with Feyre. But the author made it easy for me to dislike him as he wanted to lock Feyre up, keep her as his trophy and suffocate her by being overprotective.""Love was balm as much as it was poison""The reason why Feyre had been hopelessly in love with Tamlin could've been because of the fact that she was lonely and desired company and so fell for the first person who showed her a hint of kindness and offered commiseration and safety.Whereas Rhysand was different, he gave Feyre the freedom to choose what she desired and believed in her capabilities. He soundlessly, silently, fought for her. A perfect gentleman.""He locked you up because he knew- the bastard knew what treasure you are. That you are worth more than land and jewels.The story also shows us how much our first impression of people/ things could be wrong in the form of role reversals in the male protagonist. Rhysand, who I once perceived as a manipulator, liar, and a ""shameless flirt"" unveils his identity mask and shows how considerate and sacrificing he can be for the people he cares about. I'm glad I could see a whole new depth to his character, that despite being hard as a shell on the outside, he too had moments of weakness wherein he needed consolation.The book was in support of feminism andequality.It also shows how one can go to any extent to protect their friends and loved ones whilst also exemplifying thatyou can choose your family.Cassian, Azriel, Amren, and Mor were amazing support systems and I'd give anything to meet them in real life.I could keep going on and on about it, but I think I will peace out for now. 😁✌️",5
258,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","Buckle up ladies and gents and those outside these labels:Mary will have words with you (and she will stop referring to herself in third person).“When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.”A Court of Mist and Furyis a million steps up fromA Court of Thorns and Rosesfor a thousand reasons and one. The most prominent one though, the one that glows with the fire of a thousand suns, is how—even as a cheasy, romantic fairytale—this book is more painful and human due to themes of trauma and mental health than both its predecessor and its inspirations:Beauty and the BeastturnedHades and Persephone.“To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”With anexpanded yet still fairytalish (meaning less defined rules) world,emotional, dramatic, flowing, thread-of-thought writing, andnew, captivating, and steal-your-heart-stab-you-in-the-dark characters and dynamicson top ofthemes of depression, abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder, ACoMaF really has much to talk about.Shall we begin to dig in?“[I knew that] I would never be a gentle grower of things, or someone who burned like fire—but that I would be quiet and enduring and as faceted as the night. That I would have beauty, for those who knew where to look, and if people didn’t bother to look, but to only fear it...then I didn’t particularly care for them, anyway.”Mental Health:How We Can Inflict Pain While in Pain➥PTSD, Depression, and (Possibly) BPD with Feyre & TamlinOne of the first things people criticiseA Court of Mist and Furyfor is Tamlin—some say his actions came out of the blue, while others agree that he was acting according to character but SJM made him an unnecessary villain when he could’ve been given support to heal. So before I discuss Feyre’s mental health issues and their representation, I’m going to address those two groups of people.“I am drowning. And the more you do this...you might as well be shoving my head under the water.”➤Do Tamlin’s choices come out of the blue?The answer is a simple no, and here’s why: Even inA Court of Thorns and Roses,Tamlin was a controling, aggressive, uncommunicative person who did not know how to truly listen or speak, how to be considerate and open. This makes sense because not only was he not taught any of those traits, he also experienced trauma and abuse growing up.He is extremely emotional and has no idea how to control those emotions, all while having learned to ignore his feelings because only ruthlessness equals survival and efficiency. This is unhealthy for a myriad of reasons, least of which is the fact that,no matter how willfully and insistently you turn away from your emotions, they never go away—closing your eyes so you might not see them doesn’t mean they aren’t there, it just means they’ll pounce on you in your greatest moments of weakness and you simply won’t see them coming.“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”Tamlin is lonely and broken and living behind a wall of mistrust and fear, not knowing how to tear down that wall nor even acknowledging its existence. I have a couple of friends who struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder and, while I don’t want to diagnose anyone here, he actually reminded me of one of them. I will elaborate, bear with me.➤Is Tamlin’s arc unnecessary and unrealistic?That is a straight up no, because of the aforementioned friend. Much like my friend, Tamlin neither wants to acknowledge that he needs help, nor does he want to be vulnerable enough toacceptanyone’s help. Do I think he is broken beyond repair? No, no one is broken beyond repair.Our scars, however ugly, are what make us beautiful, and the cracks in a broken glass can be filled with gold, healed to become something new.But do I think he could’ve healed in this book with the help of Feyre and Lucien? Again no, because of two reasons.“There is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.” I pictured each. “There is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.”❶ I’ve personally grappled with mental illnesses for years and have friends both online and offline suffering who I’ve walked this path with, dragged back from the edge of suicide, and given help and solutions to when they hurt themselves and others so they could heal. I’ve also made a very, very unhealthy choice again and again and put aside my healing to be everyone’s full-time therapist. Anyone who was in pain? I would roll up my sleeves, telling them to come seek me out whenever and for whatever, and put all my energy in the ring when they did.Now, I’ve learned something from my online big sis Cath:You areno one’s therapist(unless that’s your job ofc). And Feyre did what she could to give Tamlin the space and support he needed, but she was also suffering herself and it’s cruel and infuriating to expect her to completely forget about her own pain and force him to heal when he isn’t truly accepting or seeking help. Which is the 2nd reason.“Sweep it under the rug, like everything else.”❷It’s one thing to support and help a friend towards healing, and it’s another thing toheal them. You can’t save a drowning man who refuses to take your hand. You could jump in, grab them, and swim to shore—but there’s a high chance they would drown you, too, in their attempt to get you off them.Again, I have done this, and it’s wrong because not only was I taking away their choice and saying that I know better (which I don’t, it’s their life) I was also risking them drowning me—I don’t much care about this, let me drown who cares, but it’s not healthy behaviour.Still, I’ve done it, put life and breath and soul into showing those drowning friends why they should seek a hand to stop their drowning and learn to swim, and I’ve failed as many times as I’ve succeeded. That friend I mentioned Tamlin reminded me of? She’s one where I failed, and all I could do was watch her in pain as she lashed out and inflicted pain on others, and try my best to do damage control with her victims—because theywerevictims, as Feyre clearly is one.A victim of abuse rooted in ignored, festering pain, twisting a caring, passionate soul into a source of suffering.“There are good days and hard days for me—even now. Don’t let the hard days win.”Now that that is out of the way, how about Feyre’s struggles?➤Above all else, this book is a love letter to healing.I can’t personally vouch for the PTSD (which I found accurately written based on what I’d learned of it from others’ experiences), but I can tell you about depression. And I can tell you how heartwrenchingly Feyre’s suffocating blanket of silence that cruelly embraced her and hauled her beneath the sea resonated with me. I will leave the exploration and healing to Sarah J. Maas. Thank you.Friendship:Why We Need Support to Heal➥Rhys, Mor, Amren, Azriel, and Cass Vs. LucienI think the second best thing about ACoMaF, beside its rep, was its characters and their dynamics. More specifically, the Court of Dreams. I find that name too cheesy to swallow so from now on I’m referring to them as the Gang #sorrynotsorry.“I have so many things to deal with that I’m sometimes tempted to unleash my power across the world and wipe the board clean. Just to buy me some damned peace.”#relatable✦Rhysandmight not be my number one (or two, or even three) character in this series, but that does not mean I don’t love him, it just shows how many amazing characters grace the pages of this book—because Idolove him.He might be arrogant and teasing and always seem in control, but underlying that facade is a deeply rooted insecurity and self doubt.They do say the most seemingly arrogant people in the room are the least confident ones (I mean, I hope they do and I didn’t just creates a saying out of the blue).Confidence means believing in yourself even as you mess up, and Rhys might be arrogant but he’s not confident—his every mistake and misstep are worms he lets devour him from the inside out. And he does make mistakes, because he is not perfect, just as no one is; he is a person who, in his drive to protect and give and give andgivefrom himself until he is bled dry, tends to occasionaly refuse to share what he knows and others should be informed of. What’s most important though is howhe accepts, apologises, and learns from his mistakes because what he values most is freedom of individuals to choose the path they want to walk.“You remain your own person. You decide your fate—your choices. Not me. You chose yesterday. You choose every day. Forever.”✦Amrenwith her no-nonsense, practical, I-will-sooner-kill-you-than-coddle-you attitude is my real number one, because this unyielding Tiny Ancient One would tear the world to pieces to fight for what she holds dear—though you wouldn’t guess what it is she values with her general cutting reply to everything around her.“I once lived in a place where the opinion of others mattered. It suffocated me, nearly broke me. [...] with enough courage, you can say to hell with a reputation. You do what you love, what you need.”✦Mortakes the spot as my 2nd fave right next toAzriel; where one is fire and boldness and charisma, the other is ice and silence and an enigma, and both will have your back and front and sides all the way to the threshold of death—and beyond. And then there is babyCassianwith his insufferable arrogance and heart of marshmallows that will push you and be there to catch you if you fall. (I need to add that I will take my hope for a polyamorous relationship between these three with their complicated, enchanting dynamic to the grave and hold it close through whatever comes next).✦ But why are they so important to Feyre’s healing?Because you can’t heal alone. I’ve tried it, and the road is rockier and more precarious without a shoulder to lean on and a hand to hold.I’m still learning to not cringe at taking a hand to walk the path (and failing, not gonna lie) but I nevertheless appreciate how breathtakingly SJM writes these journeys of recovery every. damn. time. You need friends to heal, and you need to help friends to heal.“I wonder if, even in my despair and hopelessness, I was never truly alone. I wonder if I was looking for this place—looking for you all.”✦ That’s whereLucienfails. I love him and his loyal heart, but sometimes you need to check your loyalty—sometimes the people and values you are holding on to are breaking something rare and fragile.That’s the precise issue with Lucien: He does not understand the depth of Feyre’s pain, if he had, he would’ve fought without backing down, getting up each time he hit the ground, because my baby is not a coward. Alas, people don’t ever really grasp another’s invisible pain.Romance:Where Love Can Bloom(SPOILER ALERT)➥Instalove or Slow Burn, featuring Feysand“I’m thinking, that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”Rhysand and Feyre are not my fave couple as their dynamic is too sweet and romantic for me personally. However, it takes nothing away from howyoufeelthem fall in love, like a flower blooming and a freezing pair of hands finding colour next to the miracle of fire, or like the warmth and light of a familiar embrace you fall into in a world of cold, dark unknowns.Some readers accuse the mating bond of being instalove in the case of Rhysand falling for Feyre. Did they read chapter 54? Rhysand fell for her as she was a human surviving Under the Mountain, and everything he did before that was him trying to save an innocent girl he suspected of being his mate but did not specifically feel anything towards.In the end, mayhaps this book is too romantic for me, the aromantic with a heart of ice, to ever be my #1 book of all time, it nonetheless makes a comfortable and cozy den in its corner becauseA Court of Mist and Furyis a fairytale that takes the dashing princes and magic, and replaces it with human suffering and healing.“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written? I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince–the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”CompanionsBook series playlist:Spotify URLBooks in series:➴A Court of Thorns and Roses(ACoTaR, #1) ★★★✯☆➴ A Court of Mist and Fury (ACoTaR, #2) ★★★★★➴A Court of Wings and Ruin(ACoTaR, #3) ★★★★☆➴A Court of Frost and Starlight(ACoTaR, #3.1) ★★★☆☆➴Untitled Novella(ACoTaR, #3.2) ☆☆☆☆☆➴A ​Court of Silver Flames(ACoTaR, #4) ☆☆☆☆☆",5
259,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","*spoilers alert**Warning! Overuse of the word fuck (courtesy of Ms. Maas who uses it freely in this book). If you have problems with swearing, do not read this review*Buddy read with my partners in disappointment:Katerina&Vera. Yay, we are freed from under the Mountain at last! And a special hug goes to my dear friendSimona(click on the names to see girls' reviews) You were right, dear, reading this book and, especially, discussing it is so much fun, indeed.First of all, let me show to you a simplediagram, where you can see how the level of my engagement toward this book...uh, plummeted (actually I wanted to make the diagram more vertical, but, well, I am not good with graphic stuff) with every chapter until nothing was left for me to enjoy.And let me tell you it was a rather bumpy and painful ride.Now, let's clarify a few things:- I am not a fan of ACOTAR. You can see inmy reviewwhy.- I had few expectations starting this book... ah hell, I had THE ONLY expectation - Rhysand.-I do not hate this book, I dislike it.<----- I am close to hating it now.This review is probably going to be a mess of thoughts with no structure, so I am sorry in advance if it's confusing, I just wanted to splash out my disappointment.I liked Rhys in the previous book; I liked his darkness. I knew he was not evil and had his reasons to act as he did, and I wanted to know why. I wanted him and Feyre together. But turns out, me and Rhys are never going to happen, not because he acts OOC (out of character) - after finishing the book, I know that he didn't act OOC - I dislike his sugary nature; there's too much goodness in him, he is practically a Saint: hell, he is the Saint among Fae!“We are lucky to have him, Feyre.” I turned from the door. “I have known many High Lords,” Amren continued, studying her paper. “Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”“Dreams of what?” I breathed.“Of peace. Of freedom. Of a world united, a world thriving. Of something better—for all of us.”Of course, the other High Lords are stupid, they don't see the war coming, they are not interested in peace and prosperity, only Rhys does everything, and no one wants to listen to him.Poor baby.And let's not forget he is the strongest Fae out there.Here—here was the most powerful High Lord ever born.The face of dreams and nightmares.Only throughout the book, there was more than one situation where his ""mighty"" powers let him down.The question: why make him so powerful, impossibly so, if a little bit of vulnerability could've made him more real and likable, and suited the plot better. It's unnatural to be that good. He became a cardboard character with no backbone and lives only to serve Feyre, it seems.But, fuck, it wasn't even my biggest issue. I hated how Maascompared Tam and Rhys in this book all the time. I never liked Tam, but, seriously, how much shit you can splash on one person before he turns into shit himself? I pity Tam and what Maas did to him. Time and again Maas shoves down our throats how Rhys excels Tam in everything: Tam didn't want to talk to Feyre about his nightmares. Rhys wanted to talk and share. Tam never held her hair while she vomited her guts out every night (she does it a lot, by the way, nauseatingly so). Rhys held her hair and cuddled her:He never woke when the nightmares dragged me from sleep; never woke when I vomited my guts up night after night. If he knew or heard, he said nothing about it.Large, warm hands pulled my hair back a moment later.“Breathe,” Rhys said. “Imagine them winking out like candles, one by one.”I heaved into the toilet again, shuddering as light and heat crested and rushed out of me, and savored the empty, cool dark that pooled in their wake.Tam locked her up in the house and forbade her to participate in any action. Rhys allowed her to do whatever she wanted. Tam didn't let her visit his rooms. Rhys invited her to his;With Tamlin, he’d kept his own rooms and slept in mine. And I supposed—I supposed it’d be the same.I was almost to my bedroom door when Rhysand drawled from behind me, “We can use your room if you like, but … ” He was leaning against his open bedroom door. “Either your room or mine—but we’re sharing one from now on. Just tell me whether I should move my clothes or yours. If that’s all right with you.”Tam is starving his people. Rhys's people prosper (he probably gives them food for free). Tam said there are no High Ladies in Prythian. Rhys made Feyre High Lady of Night Court. Comparisons were in EVERYTHING like the author couldn't stop shoving up our asses how Tam is lesser than Rhys in every aspect you can think of. And all this is solely for Feyre to make it easier to dump Tam and switch to Rhys.Then there's Feyre and herlovesex life. Feyre said that she fell for the first guy who showed kindness to her.I’m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me a hint of kindness and safety.But she can't - wouldn't - admit that it wasn't love that she felt for Tamlin. She, time and again, repeats it was love: she loved and sacrificed and then forgot the guy in two months' time. I would've respected her more if she admitted that it was lust.He buried his face in my neck and said onto my nape, as if the words would be absorbed by my body, as if he could only say it the way we’d always been good at communicating—skin to skin.Whyfeel guiltyabout wanting another male? But no, Feyre is Mary Sue, she can't be the simple girl who had a change of heart. She loved but had serious reasons to fell out of love.Easy-peasy. Heck, I would've respected her more if she was an elite prostitute serving High Lords and choosing her next lover without shame or labeling lust as love. But she is a hypocrite and Ihate hypocrites. It leads me to my next issue.Feyre/Rhysand. Honestly, I don't believe Tam loved Feyre, no, they just had a comfy agreement: fuck but don't ask questions. Rhys, on the other hand, I believe he really loved her. What about her? No. I am still not convinced it was love from Feyre's side; lust - yes. Again,Feyre has a pattern: when Rhys was a bad guy, she hated him, but when he started doing good stuff for her, she realized how good he is, how kind (don't forget this all is in comparison with Tam like we are stupid kids and can't fathom the universal truth: Rhys is good, Tam is bad);Feyre doesn't ""love"" Rhys despite his flaws, she ""loves"" him because he has no flaws.Mr. Purrfect Perfection. And when she finally admits she wants him, she still acts like a hypocrite by saying, ""But I loved Tam, deeply, I just don't any longer, because he treated me badly (I still don't get how splashing some paint on walls and locking her up once is abusive and the reason to easily fall out of love)."" Did you love him indeed? I want to ask for the thousandth time. Feyre just says she loved him to find an excuse to fuck Rhys. And that leads us to theirmating bond.When Feyre finds out they are mates, she relaxes and thinks, ""Fuck, what a relieve now that I know Tam and I was never going to happen, I don't have to feel guilty any longer for wanting to fuck Rhys"". But before we cover the mating process, let's touch on the snotty conversation they had. If you still had any doubts before that Rhys is a Saint, believe now that he is. He is a miracle reborn. Attention: he was always kind to Feyre even when he was a dick toward her. He loved her already when they were under the Mountain, he knew they are mates, it wrecked him to hurt her; he was jealous of unworthy Tam, but Rhys was noble and didn't want to ruin Feyre's life. And that sloppy melodramatic speech of his continues for a whole chapter!""A Court of snort and boredom""as someone on GR called it once (sorry, I don't remember who said that or I'd hug this person). And again, Rhy's goodness is shoved down our throats *gags*Mate.My—mate.This beautiful, strong, selfless male … Who had sacrificed and wrecked himself for his family, his people, and didn’t feel it was enough, that he wasn’t enough for anyone.Also, as we are on the topic... did you noticehow many times the phrase""my mate""is repeated in the book?!Hundreds of times! It's like a broken record player. I think if I hear ""mate"" one more time I may vomit like our Feyre-parrot does all the time.They fuck. It's a disaster of epic proportions. Mountain quacked. MOUNTAIN. QUACKED. Seriously? What was that? Some kind of cheap shapeshifter porn?Okay, When they are done, and I am done yawning, and we all move to civilized surroundings... wait, what the fuck is happening?!Rhys acts like an animal, he can't stop wanting to screw Feyre. Their mating bond makes them horny as fuck. He is so protective of his female. It's serious stuff among Fae folk, they could even kill if another male looks sideways at their females.“The … frenzy,” he said carefully, as if fearful the wrong word might send us both hurtling for each other before we could get sustenance into our bodies. “When a couple accepts the mating bond, it’s … overwhelming. Again, harkening back to the beasts we once were. Probably something about ensuring the female was impregnated.” My heart paused at that. “Some couples don’t leave the house for a week. Males get so volatile that it can be dangerous for them to be in public, anyway. I’ve seen males of reason and education shatter a room because another male looked too long in their mate’s direction, too soon after they’d been mated.”Faeries - cunning, highly intelligent, powerful creatures act as if they are primitive animals from a cheap porn novel. After Rhys loses some steam fighting his buddy, he goes and fucks Feyre against the table. Everyone outside hears and knows. Wonders! How civilized they are indeed! Are we supposed to find these animal games romantic? Does it suppose to be a healthy relationship?And this book is labeled as YA and published by Bloomsbury Children's!It is NA (new adult) or erotic at the very least!My next issue - the plot. First of all, let's not delude ourselves there's something more to the book apart from theromancemating.The plot is a crutch for the romance.Everything characters do, they do between Rhys's and Feyre's courting. And even these parts are poorly executed. Why, oh why, does Maas need to chew everything for us?! We are not stupid, we can get hints and would like to have some space left for the imagination.Show, don't tell.Show us through hints and glances, make us work for information; make us want to know! And the plot itself is primitive: go there, do that - monotone routine with no unexpected parts. 50% into the book and I have already known how everything would end.I don't understand the half-orgy scene in the Court of Nightmares where Feyre and Rhys were almost fucking while everyone watched. It was a distraction while the others were stealing something important. It's so stupid I can't even. Maas couldn't think of something smart for distraction, rather than thisdisgusting humiliating scene?! The best part is the ending, though. Why would mortal queens conspire with the King of Hybern? Because they want immortality? They'll get their immortality but will be slaves. Would it be worth it? I don't think so. And why demonstrate the experiment with humans turning into Fae twice? Wasn't one time enough, when Feyre's sister Elain was made into Fae? Why make the same with Nesta? Because it serves Maas's idea of making Feyre's sisters immortal and finding mighty mates for them. It doesn't matter that the plot looks illogical and stretched - everything is ideal for Maas's grand plans. Tam is a traitor because he wants Feyre back. Why, he is a reborn villain now! How stupid it is to betray your country, because of the woman who doesn't want you? Why villains in this book so villainous? Why there's no depth to them? Good is good, bad is bad. End of conversation.This book is 640 pages long. 640 pages of unnecessary descriptions of clothes, Rhys's goodness, Tam badness, Feyre's vomiting, mating, getting from point A to point B. 640 pages of parading High Lords to who I wouldn't trust to rule a swamp, let alone whole Kingdoms. Where's the smart and cunning in this book? And what kind of place is Night Court? Is it a mix of East and West and the modern world? Lace underwear, seriously?! Why does Night Court resemble so much human reality? Is this another point to Rhys's goodness? I have tons of questions toward this book, but I don't think getting my answers will somehow make it better. It's late for that.I wouldn't say there wasn't anything good about the book for me. Compared to Rhys and Feyre I liked secondary characters, and Cass and Nesta as a couple attract me more than Rhys and Feyre ever will. It's sad I am not interested in learning more about them in the context of this series.When I started this book, I practically had no expectations, and now I am angry. Angry at the book I wasn't even sure I would read in the first place! It's a new low. If this book was an erotic novel or NA, I would say, ""Good, we had sexy time"" - and move on. But this book pretends to be something different than it really is. Something more meaningful and deep, and it cruelly deceives people into thinking they are going to read a fantasy YA with a strong plotline and character development. They will be surprised to find an entirely different beast here. I am glad I am finally done with this series:no more, never again, burn in hell, book.",1
260,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","Reread 2022 - I still despise Tamlin! - I listened to the graphic novel. I love these kinds of audios!Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾*******RHYSAND and CASSIAN, I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART ♥I mean who doesn't right?THAT COVER!HOLY FECKING SH*T BALLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THERE WILL BE SPOILERS!I am so in love with Rhysand! He isNOTan evil dude! He's so freaking cool, hot, bad-@ssed and everything else.I liked the first book well enough but I was hoping this one would get into more of Rhysand's story and it freaking does! At first it's Feyre with Tamlin and it was okay starting out and then I started to get mad at how Feyre was treated like a prisoner. Tamlin treated her like she was some little thing that could break. And even though Feyre has powers of the freaking 7 High Lords and she's an immortal fae with a human heart.... he still treats her like sh*t!She is about to marry Tamlin but she doesn't feel like it's right. Not right at all and she's calling out in her brain to be saved in a sense and bloody hell!ENTER: RHYSANDHe just comes in to take her away before she gets married because of that little clause they set up in the first book. She's pretty livid at first and they have some bickering and what not.BUTshe soon realizes that Rhysand is there to teach her, not hold her down. Not keep her hidden away to go to balls and boring bullshit. Nooooooooooooooooo... he trains her to read (no she can't read) and to put up her mental walls to block anyone out. He ends up training her in a lot of things and bringing out her powers by getting her mad.Then she goes back to Tamlin and he's all crazy acting and goes off with Lucien but he won't take her with him. I think that was after the second time she went with Rhysand. Who the hell cares.. Anyway, so when Tamlin doesn't take her to tend to some business and leaves her blocked in the manor, she freaks the shit out. Who wouldn't?! Rhysand can feel her through the bond, he sends in Mor to get her out and bring her to him because he can't come and get her in a certain area because of some bullshit thing that will cause a war.Moving on..... From there it's basically piss off Tamlin, it's now all about Rhysand, Feyre and the war they are trying to stop.Also, I love Rhysand's court. They are some really cool fae and what not. The what not being Amren. She is something else entirely that pretty much everyone is afraid of and one day he hopes to break her from her spell and unleash her on the world. Well, if they piss him off enough. No, but really, he does hope to break her from a spell she is under. He's just that nice. Then there is Azriel, Cassian and Mor. They are his bad @ss fighters and so likeable. Hell I loved them all! I love when they go flying and they have all of these powers and are so damn cool! Oh and Mor is his cousin, I think she's his cousin, damn I forgot!Rhysand is the High Lord of the Night Court. But he's not this evil person. Well, okay so he will torture his enemies if he has too, but who cares. He is very powerful as well. And lo and behold he has a town that he lives in called Velaris, I think it's 5oo years that he has kept the place hidden and protected people. Gee, imagine that.Anyway, so King Hybern wants to bring the walls down and bring war to the humans and all of Prythian. He just has to get these last few pieces to put this thing together and then do something. I can't tell you EVERYTHING!The book is large and it didn't get boring at all, I mean everything involving Rhysand and his people were awesome. He even made Feyre a part of his court as well. He had his people training her to fight and he did as well.Just know, there is a lot of cool stuff going on in the book. Evil beings and creatures and even some awesome revelations. We have to have those right :-)The ending make me want to scream and scream. I got a headache if that counts! It's sad, but there will be some shit going down in the next one. And... um.... Sarah J. Mass... can you put out the next book next month.... please!I leave you with anEXCERPTMY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List",5
261,"A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)","Sometimes there are no words, and those reviews are the hardest.ACOTAR was a contrary introduction to the series: flawed and splendid, slow and action-packed.It featured a heroine who drove many crazy with her senseless decision-making and a plot which only emerged in the last hundred pages of the book. The rest was mostly romance, and a glimpse into a rich world.And I loved it.I didn't love the pacing which was split 3-parts-romance, 1-part-action, in a fantasy book. I didn't love the initial plot. But I loved the fragments of the world we got to see, and Iendlesslyloved the flawed characters.The. Flawed. Characters.Beautifully flawed, tragically flawed, humanly flawed.Feyre, who had never gotten a chance to allow her sense to catch up with how quickly her instincts had been forced to grow up.Lucien, whose better judgment was rarelybetter, and rarelyjudgment, and who fled physical horrors only to spend a hundred years bracing against mental horrors and came out of it sassy, hilarious and shielded.Rhysand, who traded brute strength and weapons for secrets and schemes, and whose outward battles seemed to wage a larger war against his internal ones. AndTamlin, who was as big of a puzzle at the end as he was at the beginning.My expectations for ACOMAF wereastronomical. They were higher than astronomical. I held it to a standard that I thought no book couldeverachieve.And those expectations werelaughable- just laughable compared to what I got in their stead.My'astronomical'was surpassed around chapter 5. Sarah J. Maas had me expecting romance, sexual tension, some societal squabbles and light political scheming. But in that world, with those characters, it would have been a dream.But what I got instead... *laughs* (See: line 1 of this review for my in-depth thoughts. That's right, they are all screaming too loudly for one to winnow the others out.)(And yes, that was an ACOMAF pun right there.)It's not just that the world expands, it's thewonderit expands into.From a single mansion and a single cavernous dungeon to sprawling courts, kingdoms, entire worlds, all intricately weaved together and all rich and vivid and... amazing. I'm not just saying this. I was dead serious that time I offered up my soul in exchange for life incertain parts ofPrythian. The world is that glorious thing that happens once in a bluebook(and blue it is!), where to pry yourself away from it makes this real world so bleak by comparison. (Don't live in books, children. But leave me in this one forever. Do as I say, not as I do.)I am now a proud citizen of Velaris, and I shall defend it with my soul.(For example, I scream at its enemies when they attempt to uncover it. And by scream, I mean throat: hoarse, neighbors: concerned, explanation: futile. It was a blast.)And then there are the flawed characters. Those flawed characters I loved so much who now evolve. Progress. Regress. Unravel. Dim. Shine.NEVER has Sarah J. Maas done character development like this. Not like this. And never could I have imagined it being this good.One, whose development goes in a way I've nevereverseen done in YA to this extent. One, whose development goes exactly as expected - sinister, and cruel, and scheming, and awful. One, whose renewed struggle mirrors their past and regurgitates old fears. One, who was nothing like what they seemed. One, who was exactly what they seemed.And a new cast I loved so, so very much that they are my honorary family and don't you dare tell me they aren't real.I know people who can hurt you. And they may or may not live in Prythian. Beware.But none of this was as mindblowing asthe themes.This is a book of plot, a book of messages, and a book of subtle, background romance and powerful, foreground themes. It's a sort of fantasy that weaves subtextof such enormous importanceinto an utterly engaging plot. I cannot, cannot explain what the exploration of abuse, consent, agency, freedom, depression, captivity, trauma and anxiety has meant to me.There will never be words, possibly. I've done the best I can with the ones I have at my disposal. The real words, though... they just don't exist quite yet.",5
262,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","➥ 2 Stars *:･ﾟ✧""People spend so much time wondering why the women don't leave. Where are all the people who wonder why the men are even abusive? Isn't that where the only blame should be placed?""━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━tw: graphic domestic violence, graphic attempted rape, suicide, depression, alcohol abuse, depressionUpdate:One of my Goodreads friends broughtthis articleto my attention: an article by domesticshelters.org that outlines the harmfulness of this book. Definitely worth the read.I’ve rewritten this review three times now, andeach time I’ve felt it necessary to lower my rating.I don’t intend for this to be a hot take. I’m not trying to be unique or quirky for disliking a popular book but every day I grow more and more concerned with the number of people who misinterpret and romanticize this book. There will be spoilers in this review.I’d like to begin by acknowledging Colleen Hoover’s intent with this book and how I believe it is a serious problem.Firstly,Colleen Hoover has expressed her disapproval and dislike for trigger warnings.She expressed that“as a fellow reader with my fair share of past experiences, I understand that there are issues some people do not want to read about. But as a writer, there are many things I don’t want revealed in the blurbs of my books.”This is extremely irresponsible and inconsiderate of an author.Furthermore, this book has been and is marketed as a love triangle andColleen Hoover employs the fact that Ryle is an abusive fucker as a plot-twist.In the author’s note, she states that “In the past, I’ve always said I write for entertainment purposes only. I don’t write to educate, persuade or inform. This book is different.”Yet, she continues to format this more serious book, similarly.Furthermore, although I understand that Colleen“wanted to write something realistic to the situation my mother was in – a situation a lot of women find themselves in”, I feel that Ryle was very different to her father.This coming explanation is just my presumption and random thought process. I could have greatly misinterpreted what Colleen went through and I do not mean to be disrespectful.I do not doubt that domestic abuse can be very different, but I believe the fact that Colleen’s father was an alcoholic has a huge impact on her final opinion of him. One could argue that her father needed help, and that although he is to blame, it did not come purely from malintent and manipulation. I am not saying that he is redeemable by any means, only that part of the violence can be due to an unintentional factor. Ryle still ends up having custody over the baby. This is infuriating to me.But we see that she wrote it this way because Colleen still had a relationship with her abusive father after her mother divorced him.Then we have the way that Colleen's father continues to (in my opinion) manipulate her by showing kind, good aspects of himself, like agreeing and encouraging Colleen’s stepfather to walk her down the isle rather than him. Just a thought or something to possibly consider.And in this book, we see Ryle presented as, not a bad person, instead, only a""person who does bad things"".Now, I've been thinking about this line.I wonder if it was Colleen’s intention to have Ryle say this line to purposefully show how he manipulates Lily into having this mindset or if Colleen really does think this way.Ryle is indeed a bad person, and abuser who is irredeemable. I understand and agree that it is at times, difficult to label someone as “bad” or “good” as it is more complicated than that. But there comes a point, that person is a bad person (for instance, when he tries to horrifically rape her and guilt-tripped Lily with his trauma). Colleen attempts to evoke confliction in the reader by writing in that Ryle donates to charity. Yet, this is not enough. One donation does not make you a good person, especially when compared to the severe harm that you’ve caused others. I cannot believe that after Ryle attempted to rape Lily, there are still Ryle apologists out there. That moment was absolutely mortifying.Regardless, the general plotline of this book is supposed to be that Ryle starts off as being a kind, loveable man with whom Lily and the reader fall in love with. But, his abusive and manipulative tendencies are slowly revealed until it becomes clear that he is an abuser and that this is a case of domestic abuse. However,from the beginning of the book, Ryle is already portrayed as a concerningly violent and manipulative man.We are introduced to his character when Lily finds him kicking a chair out of anger, something unacceptable and very worrying. Later on,he begs and successfully coerces Lily into having sex with him, purely and solely because he wants to.Unfortunately, at this point in the story, many people still like, possibly even love, Ryle. This is not the ""turning point"" per se.I’ve also recently seen many people criticizing Colleen Hoover’s ability to write a healthy relationship and I’m beginning to agree. Although I remember enjoying Ugly Love, it was certainly unhealthy, specifically in the way that our female main character was treated. Then I began to read ""November 9"" and was utterly mortified by the way Ben, our love interest, acted. There are plenty of reviews with quotes etc. that show how horribly and scarily Ben treated Fallon from the beginning, before the plot twist.So, I conclude that Colleen’s failure to properly structure a base for the story to build upon was a main concern.In regards to Ryle’s trauma,it is something that he weaponizes to manipulate and guilt-trip Lily.It does not excuse the abuse and I think it’s gravely concerning for people to blame the abuse on his trauma. Although it’s understandable to feel bad for what he had to go through, it is all used to manipulate and abuse Lily.Then we have Atlas. When I first read this book, I was quite taken with how caring and sweet Lily and Atlas’ childhood romance seemed to be. But upon reflection, I’ve become more and more concerned by Atlas’ presence in this book at all.I’ve seen countless girls swooning over the“I know it wasn’t a pity fuck, Lily. I was there”line, yetAtlas had sex with Lily while she was a minor.I question why Colleen Hoover would choose to make it that way. It’s extremely unnecessary and the illegality of it could have been easily avoided had she chosen for them to be the same age.This again shows Colleen’s inability to write healthy relationships.Furthermore, I found that the side romance in general greatly took away from the purpose of the book.The fact that Lily had to be saved by another man is truly a damaging thing to portray. Many women who experience domestic abuse do not have the option to leave just because there is a better man out there and it’s also damaging to make it seem that Lily is simply picking between Ryle or Atlas.Moreover, this expands my discontent with howColleen chose to shove in aspects of her usual work to something so serious.A side love story was truly unnecessary for this, but I believe Colleen knew that if she wrote something without romance, it would not sell. Can I blame her for that? I’m not quite sure, but it certainly does not please me.Deriving from what I’ve mentioned so far, particularly about Ryle,it bothers me how little conclusion Colleen offers at the end of the book.I have had to have conversation after conversation with people who misinterpreted the book, who still forgive Ryle and who think of “It Ends With Us” as a romance book. For a while, my challenge question (for friend requests) was “What is your favourite (dark) romance book and why?” And I cannot tell you the number of times people answered with “It Ends With Us”. Some people write in their reviews that even though Ryle was not Lily’s ultimate partner and just because it “did not work out”, they will still have love for Ryle in their heart and think that he just needs help. And unfortunately, I don’t think these people are to blame.With Colleen still allowing Ryle to have custody, it almost allows for a small redemption for his character. And I believe at the end of the book, Colleen should have written one page with the cycle of abuse and how it was shown throughout the novel, and a conclusion expressing that if you love Ryle,you should not,because everything that he did, he did itconsciously and with purpose, through manipulation and guilt-tripping(weaponizing his trauma). I do appreciate however, that she included the domestic abuse hotlines.I also thinkit is unacceptable for people to be recommending this book as just a “sad book” or a “book to make you cry”, becausediminishing a book that explores such a difficult and serious topic like domestic abuse, to an object that simply serves the purpose of evoking emotions from you, is extremely disrespectful and shallow.Especially considering that this is such a personal book to Colleen Hoover.Another thing that I found to be really damaging about this book isthe audience.There is this#coquetteaesthetic on tiktok that I am sure you are aware of. I really to like the look of it etc. But it is a theme among this aesthetic to read books like ""It Ends With Us"" and ""Lolita"". I believe both of these texts are greatly misinterpreted, especially considering that it is often young girls who are reading these books from the ages of 11-15. Ignoring Lolita as that is a different topic,I am nearly certain that these girls buy books like “It Ends With Us” purely for the cover.It's pink. And it fits the aesthetic.I see people saying that they ""love"" “It Ends With Us” and I find it greatly concerning. What do you love about it? I see people ignoring Lily's plotline and just adoring Atlas and his whole ""I know it wasn't a pity fuck, Lily. I was there."" They've transformed this as something to romanticise. Not to mention thatI also see girls giggle at what seems to be a little inside joke of theirs when they quote""where did you get the magnet lily""or""you fell down the stairs"".I am really beginning to think that this book has done more harm than good.The writing wasn’t something I had a problem with.When I see people criticize Colleen Hoover, it tends to be becausethey call her writing “wattpad writing” which is stupid, because people will say that any contemporary romance has “wattpad writing”.That’s not a great criticism, they should actually elaborate. Other than the quotes that I’ve disagreed with like“There’s no such thing as a bad person, only people who do bad things”, I found that Colleen Hoover’s writing flows well and that she has some iconic, well thought out quotes.I wasn’t a huge fan of Lily writing her letters to Ellenand I didn’t really care at first, but in the Acknowledgement section of “It Ends With Us”, Colleen actually says thankyou to Ellen DeGeneres saying that she is“light when it comes to darkness”. Considering what an awful person everyone knows that Ellen is, I again struggle to understand why Colleen chose this specific detail when she could have chosen someone that was a much better person and influence. *I have been informed that because this book was written in 2016, Ellen was not known to be a bad person,although I still question Colleen's decision to make Lily write letters to a talk show host.Veering off that topic and coming back to my problems with Ryle, is thatI strongly despised how he cared for Lily when she was pregnant.I felt that Ryle cared more about the baby than Lily, and it continues to portray women as baby machines who are made to serve a purpose.The way he cared for her stomach and touched her stomach rather than her. It’s disgusting.Something that also boiled my blood isthe internal misogynythat I see Colleen weave into her books.Lily chooses to not decide whether to divorce Ryle or not until after she has the baby becauseshe believes that her decision would be affected by her hormones.What the fuck?????? Was the fact that he tried to rape you and then he beat you not clear enough?Furthermore, when Lily is trying to explain to Ryle that she wants to divorce him, she tells him something along the lines of“what if this baby girl came home to you and told you ‘daddy, this boy hits me but he apologized and said he wouldn’t do it again’, what if she came home with bruises”, and only then does that garner any sympathy from Ryle.This situation parallels the instances when men only feel remorse for things like sexual assault when they are told ‘what if it was your mother and sister’.It’s horrible and it made me deeply upset that I’ve seen reviews admiring how Ryle was “understanding” after Lily explained that to him.I believe Lily was a strong character to a degree and I agreed with the way she responded to certain things (or I would have done the same), but there are times where I would have been gone, and Lily stayed (like when Ryle begged her for sex). Still, you can really tell she did have a certain level of logic and reason, and tried to confront Ryle.Something that really bugged me was the characterDevinand how Colleen Hoover writes him asthegay stereotype.He's overly touchy with Lily, touching her breasts and pulling down her bra without her consent. This is truly such a disgusting and rude way to portray characters of the lgbtq+ community, especially considering that Colleen Hoover rarely diversifies her books(very few poc + lgbtq characters). It mainly frustrates me because Colleen Hoover clearly has a huge income from the sales of her books, and that she cannot be bothered to get sensitivity readers or better editors for these things is so concerning.Another thing that was kind of unnecessary was this line:“A 2-year-old girl will have the same name even when she’s 22, Lily Bloom. Names aren’t something we eventually grow out of.”I understand the meaning behind this sentence, suggesting that parents should put thought into their children's names, and that it should suit an adult as much as a child. But I also understand that this can be seen as quite inconsiderate towards transgender people, and just people who change their names in general, because that's obviously possible too.There are just so many things that could have been easily avoided, and for these things to not be noticed and fixed is quite lazy of the author.Despite my problems with this book, I think the general idea that Colleen Hoover tried to present in this book was executed decently well at times, hence my two stars.This is a very difficult read, especially if you relate to any of it at all so please do check trigger warnings and be careful because it can be very uncomfortable to see yourself in someone like Lily, or in her position. Much love to anyone who has been through anything like this, I hope you’re okay <3━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━",2
263,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","::: SPOILER-FREE REVIEW :::Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.HOLY WOW!It Ends With Usis one of the mostpowerfulbooks of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. It wasn’t anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like… READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It's a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don't think I've ever been prouder of a heroine. I've loved Colleen Hoover's books for a long time because she always writes unique stories... and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completelyspoiler-free review. I'm not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It's a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it's amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I'm the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I've really learned to trust Colleen's writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all... and I was blown away by the story!This book isunputdownable. You'll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I've ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn't be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I'd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don't think I've been this proud of a fictional character before.There's an incrediblypowerful messagein this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don't yet realize howsignificanteach of these moments truly are... and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I'm not mentioning it on purpose because I don't want you to expect it.The fact that it's unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it's also unexpected for the heroine.As she begins to realize what kind of situation she's in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journeywithher.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the 'love triangle' because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you're thinking this book is, just trust me -- it's so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I'm always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time -- not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant -- and there's this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such astrongimpact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went 'woah!'. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn't possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make aseriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people -- whether they've personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has -- so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don't want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it toeveryone!That’s what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them.It can save them.Rating: 5+ STARS!

My name is Kelly . . . .Also, I spoil things, so back away quickly if you don’t want this one to be ruined for you.My glaring 1 Star in a sea of 5s probably makes it pretty clear that I detested this book, but please refrain from fetching your torches and pitchforks for a moment and take note that not only did Ijust 5 Star a CoHo Story two weeks ago(as well as shoved it down everyone’s throats I possibly could), but also I want to make all of the sexuals with Miles Archer and will fight anyone for dibs on his imaginary lurv making. I didn’t pick this up in order to hate on it. I’m one of you . . . . sometimes. Definitely not this time, but lots of times. And this is why I don’t ever give up on Hoover novels. I never know how I’m going to react.Allow me to explain what went wrong for me with this one . . .Let’s start with the obvious annoyances that seem to be in nearly every NA book that drive me batshit before getting to the real nitty gritty. First, the character names. Ryle, Lily Bloom and Atlas???????Is it against the law tonotuse absolutely ridiculous (™Ron2.0) names in these books????Second . . . .“Your lips. I love how they’re as red as your hair.”According to Google (all hail Google) less than 2% of the world’s population has red hair, and yet 99.998% of all NA leading ladies do. Just stahp.Third, non-existent chemistry. In this story Lily and Ryle meet by chance on a rooftop after experiencing respective miserable days. In a matter of minutes Lily goes from worrying the stranger on the roof could be a psycho killer/rapist to getting into his super sexy (NOT) pick-up lines . . .“If you wouldn’t sleep with someone you just met . . .” His eyes meet mine again. “Exactly how far would you go?”Ewww. She already said thanks but no thanks freakshow so STFU.Now let’s move on to the real big issue. I took a gander at my friends’ reviews before I started typing this and noticed my buddyChelseawas the only other naysayer in the batch. She summed it upperfectlywhen she talked about the massive amounts of emotional manipulation that was forced down the readers’ throats in order to make them feel all the things.It’s a running joke with my friends/family/co-workers that I have a robot heart. And for the majority of the time it’s true. I generally experience two emotions – happiness and annoyance. But even a robot like me can be manipulated into having a feeling/crying the ugly tears like a Kardashian once in a blue moon (*coughMe Before Youcough*). This time, though? It was like a flashing neon sign . . . .To begin with, our first leading male Atlas is a homeless teenager who Lily befriends/eventually loses her virginity. In case you don’t get the writing on the wall, Atlas is being set up as the most perfect perfection that ever perfected. He’s also the way to getting the “raised in an abusive household” plotline uncovered. Like in all NA stories, Atlas and Lily are torn apart. Lily moves on with her life, graduates college, yada yada, and, as mentioned above, meet-cutessuper creeperMr. Right 2.0 on the roof. Mr. Right 2.0 is not only another most perfect perfection that ever perfected, but he’s alsorichand aneurosurgeonand very obviously husband material even though he’s never had a girlfriend (also after dating only six months),annnnnnnnddue to their mutually busy schedules not really knowing the guy.It wasn’t too hard to see where the story was going to go (and no, I hadn’t been spoiled because I didn’t read any reviews or the synopsis, I just auto-request everything by Hoover from both NetGalley and the library). Basically this was a story about domestic abuse and making excuses not only the first time he knocks your ass down “on accident” but also the second time when you wake up after “falling” down the stairs and hearing his sob story about a superbadawful that effed him up as a kid and then agreeing on a policy where“When you’re upset, just walk away. And I’ll walk away”(becauseTHAT’Sgoing to fucking work) and then saying“It’s okay, Ryle. It’s okay. You were angry, it’s okay”and making sure even when you’re bleeding profusely out of your fucking skull and are concussed and have quite possibly just been raped by your own damn husband that you get taken to an emergency room in a hospital other than the one where your bastard abuser works in order to protect his ass as well as explaining“sometimes the reason women go back is simply because they’re in love”and in case all that wasn’t e-fucking-nough you add in a whoopsie baby (another NA per usual) to serve as the wake-up call that maybe it’d be a good idea to ditch this zero and eventually find you a hero,buuuuuuuuuuuutyou just come to an agreement regarding visitation and whathaveyou rather than involving the court and much needed supervised interaction because youknowhe wouldn’t hurt the baby since it’s obvious he loves her . . . .Nope.I’m well aware I’m going against the grain here. I give zero fucks. Don’t bother trolling me to tell me how stupid I am (especially if you’re a teenager who has lived a privileged lifestyle and never experienced anything contained in this book for yourself). I went to the wholesale club yesterday and stocked up on big ol’ batch of . . . .I will be using it freely.Many thanks to the library for having nearlyeverybook I ever want to read – especially books like these that are only approved to fangirling 5 Star reviewers prior to publication.",1
265,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","5 + brave and bold stars!!!Want the naked truth aboutIt Ends with Us? Reading this book will change your life. It’s so different from any of Colleen Hoover’s other books. You can tell it’s heavier, more personal, just more. This book is deep. It’s profound. It’s a book that needs to be read. I'll repeat:THIS IS A BOOK THAT NEEDS TO BE READ!This story is moving. It will make you think about things that are uncomfortable to think about. It will lift your heart, devastate you at times, make you proud, fill you with sorrow and make you smile. It will move you. It’s powerful and intense in the best way, but also has hopeful and lighter moments. The story itself is one that has been heavy on my heart from the moment I finished it.Sometimes, I read a book and it’s so beautiful, influential and emotional I will cry just thinking about the characters and their story. Not in a bad way necessarily, I just get that moved and that emotional while thinking about it. That is this book. Trying to find the words for this review is bringing me to tears. It’s hard to explain the story completely spoiler free, but this isn’t a ‘sad’ book. It’s a strength book. Because dealing with the issues in this story took so much strength.I’m not going to talk about the actual story at all, but I will speak a bit about the characters.Lily. Speaking of strength, Lily may be the strongest heroine that I’ve read about. Your strength is really tested when you are put in a hard situation where your choices are impossible. I loved Lily so much. I was proud of Lily and the choices she made. I want to be Lily when I grow up.Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.There are two men in this story, but please don’t think this is a triangle book. It’s not. It’s hard to explain, but it’s not.Ryleis a charming guy. He’s a giving person. He’s got a lot of great attributes. I’m not sure if I’ve ever felt so conflicted over a character as I did him.Atlasis the type of man I always have a soft spot for as a reader. His story gutted me at times, but he is also a character with a lot of strength and so much beauty. I loved Atlas from the second I met him and that love never stopped throughout the book.“Lily?” he whispers, looking at me sincerely. “You just might be the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”Aside from the three main characters in the story, Lily’s mom played a prominent part. Their relationship played an even bigger part. Ryle’s sister and Lily’s best friend Alyssa was one of my favorite characters in this book. When things got hard she was there. One line she said in the book, to Lily just solidified the type of woman she was. Coleen always writes that one side character that you love so hard in her stories, and Alyssa was that character for me. I can’t not mention Ellen, because, well, it’s Ellen. That part was brilliant. It made me smile every time Ellen was mentioned.When reading this book, there were moments I struggled between not being able to tear my eyes away from the page, and others I had to take a breather because I couldn't handle what was going on.Parts of this story left me so heartbroken and others lifted me up so high. There are some parts that are just so powerful I could only read them in awe. This is it. This is why I read. Books like this.All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.Colleen Hoover is an author who truly has a way with words. She killed this book. I’ve read and loved all of CoHo’s books. Some of her earlier books are some of my all-time favorites. I’ve enjoyed all of her latest books, but this is by far the best book she’s ever written. And it’s tied withHopelessas my own personal favorite book by her. And that is saying a lot, becauseHopelessis one of my top books ever.If you only read one book this year, let it beIt Ends with Us. Everyone needs to read this book. 5+ star favorite. Completely unforgettable and highly recommended!“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”",5
266,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","I honestly don't know how I feel.There are times I amangryand times I amsad. And then I'm both. And it's the worst, because there is a war raging inside me, and the winner side keeps changing. How is it possible to switch from denial to sorrow to fury to acceptance in a heartbeat?“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”I did my best not to cry. I felt sick, but I clenched my jaw and forced myself to keep reading, trying in vain to ignore the tremors that ran through my body. But when the last chapters came, and Colleen's note in the end, I couldn't take it any more. I dissolved into angry, hot tears, and I checked my chest to make sure my heart was not bleeding. Lily's story had a lot to teach. I think I died a little when I realized that sometimeslove is not enough. Regret, good will, they're not enough to fix some wounds. On the contrary, they make them deeper.“Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”It Ends with Usis the most personal and daring and painful bookColleen Hooverhas ever written. Abuseanddomestic violenceare a delicate subject, and when I found out they were this book's main theme I thought about not reading it. It was a moment of cowardice, a moment I didn't want to witness this side of relationships. But I owed it to myself, as a person and as a woman to proceed. Because pretending a problem doesn't exist does not make it disappear. There will bespoilersbelow so if you haven't readIt Ends with Us, you should probably stop here.“Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen.”Naked truth coming. I was one of the people who don't understand. The people who, when they hear about abuse, the first thing that occurs to them iswhy doesn'tsheleave him? Why does she let her fear guide her, and she's so selfish that makes her children witness such horrors inside their home, that was supposed to be their sanctuary?But what we should ask iswhat is wrong withhim?Instead of making excuses and trying to justify him, we should take a moment and consider how she feels, and the difficult decisions she has to make.Ryle broke my heart into millions of pieces.I fell in love with him, and I kept wishing that Colleen would delete these words, these scenes that hurt me and disappointed me and shattered my belief in happy endings. A part of me, a part I tried to smother, a part I am ashamed that exists, wanted him to change. To try harder, and for Lily to let him try harder. Me, who judged them for not leaving. In the end,I felt sorry for Ryle. For losing the love of his life, for destroying his only chance at happiness. I don't forgive him, I just wish that a magic wand would make everything better.“So much gravity, pushing down on my emotions. Everything shatters.My tears, my heart, my laughter, my soul. Shattered like broken glass, raining down around me.”Lily is a hero.She haddignity, andcourageandstrength. At first I was judging her mother for staying, but witnessing through Lily's eyes her challenges, feeling her heartbreak and her dilemmas, made me regret all the ugly things I thought. Loving the person who hurts you is a greater torture than the physical act itself. And damn it I loved Ryle, and I hated Colleen for that.I hated her for making me swoon and laugh when she was about to shatter my soul.The Katerina that startedIt Ends with Usis a different person than the Katerina that finished it. Remorseful, destroyed, wiser.“Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.”A part of me wants to forget thisraw, powerful, inspirational, beautiful and ugly book. But the dominant part, even though it suffers, is glad I read it and learned.To every single person out there,READ IT.To every woman in Lily's place,BE BRAVE AND BOLD.ToColleen Hoover,THANK YOU. For sharing this with us. With me.“Just keep swimming.”",5
267,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","EDIT: I read this book when it first came out (as an ARC) and did love it, however, with the continuation of the story I feel like it has tainted (or just changed) my view on this one. When I re-read this in prep for the new one and then diving right in to it, I feel the need to change this rating to a 2. However, I will be leaving my original review up.It Ends With Us... Wow I really don't know what to truly say about this novel. This review will be a little light because, like most CoHo books, you'll want to go into it with little to no information. I went into this book thinking it was going to be this one thing, and it turned out to be the complete opposite.IEWUfollows Lily, a girl in her early twenties, who has never had it easy. Though coming from a family that was better off she has always had to work for the things she's wanted. After graduating college she gets up and moves to Boston and hopes to start her own business. While there she meets and falls for Ryle, a thriving neurosurgeon who is determined to be the best in his field. The two hit it off hard, and things seem almost too good to be true. Ryle is everything that Lily is not. He is forward, assertive, and stubborn. He is also a lot of thing Lily is; he is strong, passionate, and motivated. Though the two have an immediate connections and sparks fly, the two decided to take their time getting to know one another. Lily is such a beautifully written leading lady. I loved getting to grow with her and be apart of her journey. I loved hearing her thoughts and seeing how she processed things. When I was first reading and got to the point where she does her journal entries, but she does them so they are letters to Ellen DeGeneres, I thought I wasn't going to like that aspect of it. The first few had me thinking ""this is a little cheesy"", but the more I got into it the more I started to enjoy them. They really tied Lily's past and present perfectly together. As Lily's and Ryle's relationship pushes forward she finds herself looking back at those entries and thoughts of her first love Atlas resurface. Atlas was her first everything and was the biggest impact on her life. Atlas was the homeless boy who found his way into the abandoned house next door. Atlas and Lily as teens formed an unlikely friendship. Sharing everything and having a bond that no one around them seemed to understand. Spending every possible moment together and having so many stolen ones the two were kindred spirits. When Atlas reappears in the story it truly threatens everything Lily and Ryle have. (not a spoiler it's given he eventually will). Both Ryle and Atlas bring such important and different aspects to this story. I think CoHo manages to make them both such polar opposites, but at the same time manages to make them mesh so well.The characters in the book, main or side, all feel so realistic and authentic.When it comes to the plot there is almost nothing I can say about it. I hope everyone will do the same to keep things from getting spoiled. The story is an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. It's one of those books that you will have a thousand theories about and all of them will be wrong. I kept trying to guess what I thought might happen next and in classic Hoover style she managed to surprise me. This book was solid from page one and was steady throughout, but around the 80% mark is where things really took a turn (in the best way possible).IEWUhit me on such a personal level. I didn't expect this book to impact me so hard. It had everything I wanted from a New Adult read. It's very classic CoHo, but it also branches out somewhere she's never been before, but she does it with such ease. She manages to weave these heavy moments with ones that will make you swoon, laugh, and then cry. My favorite part of this book though, was the author's note. Usually author's notes are at the beginning of the story, however it is so important that this one was left for the end. It took a book that was good and made it exceptional! God, this note effected me like so few books have. It made me cry fifty times harder than the entire book or anything Colleen's ever written.Finding out how important this book was for her to write will hit you hard, but I hope she also knows how important it is as a reader to read. Knowing where an author gets their ideas from can change your whole outlook on a book, and this one... this one broke me.Thank you Colleen Hoover for continuing to gift the reading community with your words.",2
268,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","Dear Colleen,I find it fitting that I write this review as a letter to you the way Lily would write to Ellen. Don't ask me why, I really don't know. What I do know is that I haven't been on Goodreads in nearly six months and it's entirely your fault that i'm here now. So, if i stumble upon a poor review on one of my books and end up in the fetal position on my kitchen floor surrounded by Ding Dong wrappers, well, I'm blaming it on you. I've even given my husband instructions to bill you for the psychiatry bill if that happens.On Friday I had a hysterectomy. It wasn't the worst day of my life, but it certainly wasn't the best. One chapter of my life--quite possibly the best chapter--ended. The surgery itself took twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. Can you believe that? Twenty minutes to take out the uterus that carried my three beautiful babies for a total of twenty eight months. Twenty minutes to change my life. Don't feel bad for me, that's not what I want. The offending organ had to come out, I knew this. But it didn't make it any easier. It didn't make the finality of the situation any easier. In all honesty, for a couple of minutes I didn't just feel like a chapter was ending, more like an entire flipping book. Maybe my life isn't made up of chapters, maybe it's part of a duet, or a trilogy? Either way, part of my story was over.Over a matter of several hours, I slowly woke up from surgery and at one point I remember sitting there and just staring at the wall paper in my hospital room.My uterus was gone.Mauve diamonds.The wallpaper was covered in mauve diamonds.That's the most hideous color, don't you think? Mauve. Not quite pink. Not quite maroon.I counted seven hundred and fifty three diamonds before I allowed the first tear to fall. But I wasn't just crying for losing a part of my body, and I wasn't crying for losing the ability to carry more children. I was crying because some women don't even get to experience what I've gotten to experience. Some women never get to have babies. They never get to feel them grow in their bellies. They never get to see the slimy little monsters as they tumble their way into this world.And I did.I got to do all of that three times.So why was I so upset? What the hell was my problem? I should be grateful, right? Happy?My husband slept soundly in the chair, snoring softly, but at some point my cries must have woken him up. He stirred and I did the only thing I could do ... I grabbed your book. You see, it was sitting on my bedside table. I buried my nose between the pages and when my better half asked me if I was okay I simply peeked over the top of the book and whispered, ""Colleen. She did it again.""I didn't need to say much more, he knows my obsession with your words and I found myself grateful. Grateful that he knew your books make me cry and grateful that you inadvertently allowed me to grieve. And that's what I did. I read your book and I grieved. I cried when Lily cried. I cried when Ryle cried. And even when no one was crying, I still cried simply because I needed to and I could and no one thought twice about it because i was reading and that's what i do when i read. It was my outlet, my excuse for the tears that wouldn't go away, the tears that kept falling despite my desperate protest.I cried for all of the Lily's in the world, and the Ryle's too. I cried for the Atlas'. And I cried for the Kirby's (that's my name. No i'm not named after a vacuum, or a cream puff)But you see, I didn't want to cry. I didn't want to be upset. I have three beautiful children whom I love with my entire heart. My body did it's job extremely well and that is something to be proud of. But why wasn't I proud?Naked truth?I'm selfish.I wanted one more baby even though my husband didn't. I wanted one more baby when there are women out there that can't have any at all.So why am I telling you this? My story is nothing like Lily's. Not even close.But maybe it is ...She wanted something she shouldn't want. I wanted something I couldn't have. She had a decision to make ... one that would change her life. So did I. She made a decision that was right for her and for her life at that particular time.Ditto.But the real reason I'm telling you this is because for two days I was drowning and It Ends With Us was my lifeline. It's what I grabbed when I needed to stop thinking ... it's what I grabbed when i needed to cry ... and when i finally finished the book and put it down, it wasn't mauve diamonds that I saw ... it was my smiling children.My three beautiful smiling children ... and my niece Lily.-- Kirby",5
269,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.4 1/2 stars.Holy crap, what a book.This is unlike anything Hoover has written before. I have so many emotions right now that it's hard to know where to start, but I think everyone should read this book. That's right: everyone.I could easily give everything away. I could, but I won't. If you go looking for lots of reviews, it won't be hard to work out whatIt Ends with Usis about. And if you do, you should still read it, but I think it's better if you don't. I think you should go into this book knowing as little as possible. Just realize that this is something very different from Hoover's usual new adult romances (that I admittedly have hadallkindsofproblemswith).So I don't want to say too much, but this is anextremely powerful storyand it's not what most people will be expecting. It gets its power from the singular first person narrative (I'm honestly not a big fan of the alternating male/female POV romances) and we experience everything through Lily's eyes. When she falls in love, we fall in love; when her heart is broken, our heart is broken; when she gets it all wrong, so do we.I cannot stress how important anddamn smartthis book is. There is no black and white characterization - it's much deeper and more complex than that, and therefore, far more emotional.It peels back the layers of characters and relationships to do something that so many other authors have tried and failed to do - to make you understand a situation that for most people makes no sense. It'svery sad, painful and exceptionally honest. My heart hurt while reading it and I almost cried several times.As well as all this emotion and sadness that I'm being coy about, Hoover also brings out some of her very best writing. Little gems of honesty about human nature and relationships that are all the more painful because of their resounding truth. It's such a quotable book, but unfortunately most of the quotes are spoilers, so I shall refrain from posting them.There's so many great things to mention, but I keep getting distracted by myfeelings. The narrative is interspersed with letters that Lily wrote as a teenager and they are addressed to Ellen Degeneres - a strange touch that ends up being absolutely perfect. Shit, just writing this review and remembering the story is an emotional experience.And then there's theabsolutely fantastic female friendship. I want Allysa to be my best friend. Hoover clearly knows her audience of 16-25 year old women, creating characters with their quirks and habits - Allysa, for example, is a self-confessed ""Pinterest whore"", which made me laugh. But seriously, she is the best friend ever and she says one of the most perfect lines in this book.Anyway, I'm just going to start rambling soon because I read this book in a whirlwind of emotions throughout a single day. I've been up since a ridiculous time and I need to go sleep now. But really, give this book a chance. I thought it was excellent.Trigger Warnings:Domestic abuse (physical, occasionally graphic).

271,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","I don’t believe in disliking things just because they are popular. I went into this with the intention of liking it, but ended up feeling uncomfortable by the tone of this book. Although I wholeheartedly respect the personal nature of this story, the author’s note does not exempt this work of fiction from criticism, especially when it comes to a topic as serious as domestic abuse.I empathize with the main character Lily and I appreciate the effort that was made to highlight how trauma distorts and lingers, but I don’t believe this captured the severity or nuance that a topic this heavy deserves in fictionalized work. This book is marketed as romance, and the synopsis makes it seem like a lighthearted love triangle instead of a woman’s experience with spousal abuse. In comparison to Kate Elizabeth Russell’s harrowing depiction of abuse inMy Dark Vanessa, the tone ofIt Ends With Usfeels acutely inappropriate. It reduces domestic abuse to a lovers quarrel and presents a tactless caricature of the realities of abuse. I can acknowledge this may not have been the intention, but the elaboration in the authors note does not absolve this book of its reckless and irresponsible marketing.It Ends With Ushas the bones of a powerful story but reads like a low budget Hallmark movie pushed forward by ridiculous plot revelations. Hoover’s attempt to make Ryle into a three dimensional character completely flops. At first, I thought the accelerated relationship between Ryle and Lily was meant to emphasize how witnessing abuse in early age might make you less likely to spot red flags in others; however, it turns out Hoover was really trying to create a deep relationship between these two. Her use of “Naked Truth” to build their relationship was a lazy ploy to circumvent true development and simulated an unsatisfying and unearned intimacy. I also found the use of teenage diary entries in the form of letters to Ellen DeGeneres to have aged really badly, and comes off as a corny device to tell rather than show readers about Lily’s relationship with Atlas.The single redeeming quality of this book is the empathy that Lily develops for her mother towards the end, but this moment, as well as the ending, lacks sufficient nuance. I wanted more discussion, I wanted more development, and I wanted less telling and more showing. Although the message that the cycle of abuse “ends with us” is personal for Hoover, I feel like this depiction is reductive and makes it seem like walking away is a choice all women have. Hoover maintains that this book was meant to show that domestic abuse isn’t black and white, but I don’t think it achieved that at all. She made the conscious decision to pit romance and abuse against each other, packaged it with a pink cover, a synopsis free of any mention of abuse, and marketed it to impressionable young adults. However well intentioned this cathartic passion project was, its reception as a work of fiction is devout of nuance, the white knight message ofIt Ends With Uscompletely undercut by its blatant romanticism of abuse.",1
272,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","this book sends a really important and worthwhile message, but it's not necessarily enjoyable.IT ENDS WITH US was not what i expected it to be. i started the novel knowing next to nothing about the storyline except that it's a colleen hoover book (NA romance) and that it'sgood(my friends kept raving). but if i'm being honest, i wasa little disappointed.i was hoping for a light read with lots of ~FEELZ~ but instead i got something much more intense – not bad, just unexpected.the main plot revolves around abusive and toxic relationships within families. it really opened my eyes to the emotions of those in these types of situations and helped me gain a lot of perspective. because of this, i think it's important to read this, but it's not enjoyable. it's definitely a really frustrating process to read.for the majority of this novel, i DIDN'T like it. i was definitely interested and curious, but i didn't care for the characters as much as i thought i would. i was frustrated and annoyed at the situations, and some of it felt artificial, rushed, and stereotypical. it all seemed so... fictional. usually the romance satisfies me, but even that didn't do it. buuuuuut it wasn't so much that i didn't NOT like it. it was simply okay when i expected it to be ~amazing~.there were two romantic tropes that bothered me because i don't like the tropes themselves and because i didn't think it was executed THAT well: insta-love and love triangle.ryle was too good to be true; a hot, young, smart, compassionate, arrogant, sensitive, rich guy suddenly appears and falls head over heels for our main character. they – somehow!! – meet again and this time he's literally BEGGING to have sex with her. suddenly, this fuckboi wants to be in a committed relationship and plans on having kids with our lucky lady. um......... okay????? i didn't feel anything for their relationship and ryle seemed like a plot device to me. and when she didn't leave him the first time, i knew i KNEW he would do much worse again. and i didn't feel surprised when it happened; i didn't feel surprised when she asked for the divorce – a little relieved maybe, but not surprised.then there's atlas, who i felt had more depth than ryle and lily but also not thaaaat much. he was probably my favorite character, but i felt his story (the letters) were kinda.. anti-climactic? their relationship was confusing to decipher, but i still loved them. it made me sad to think lily didn't end up with atlas IN THE FIRST PLACE but i guess that would make the whole purpose of the book redundant.even though i didn't enjoy the process of reading this book, i'm grateful to have read it. there are some books you read for pleasure and there are some you read to gain knowledge and perspective. this is the latter.",1
273,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","Oh my! Argh! This is me confronting my ripped apart heart pieces of mine after reading this book! Actually I read the book a long time ago! I was chickenshit to write a review! Because writing meant opening about my feelings. This book hurt me a lot and I couldn’t find enough words to give true definition of “hurt” it gave me!I honestly say this is my longest Colho reading because I putted it down several times. I got pissed! I screamed! I clenched my fists so hard! I cursed entire family tree of Ryle Kinkaid! I haven’t wanted to hire contact torturers to kidnap a character to give the punishment he’d highly deserved for so long.The things he did to Lily: the physical and emotional abuse he gave her were impossible for me to absorb. I felt breathless and I gave up several times. This book sledgehammered my heart and crushed my soul!I returned my reading because the beautiful love story between Atlas and Lily it’s like seeing sunshine through dark clouds and giving me the only hope I could hold. I honestly thought only reading the flashbacks to warm my heart!What if they reconnected that night when they accidentally meet again at the restaurant. What if Lily went back after him instead of choosing a path with Ryle. That scenario made me so happy but it would never be the same without tremendous angst Colho threw at us because she is expert to bring our the dirties ugliest cries of regular human being! And without pain and suffer, so much sadness, we don’t feel like we read actual Colho story, do we? Never!This book is in development to adapt into screenplay! It’s so compelling to read this heart stabbing, soul sledgehammering story of this book without consuming tons of paper products to dry tears we may shed. I cannot imagine how the movie will affect me. But sometimes words hurt more than actions and I’m so sure there’s no screenwriter has ability to reflect all those emotions Colho made us feel during our reads.So my advice: stock entire paper products from grocery stores, lock yourself sound proof room not to scare your neighborhood with your screams and howling sounds and give your entire concentration to this lyrical, insanely heartfelt story.It’s one of the most compelling, sad, sensational Colho book I hardly digest the emotional turmoil it gave me! But it’s worth to the pain. Especially that meaningful, sentimental, poetic ending melted my heart.",5
274,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","""We all have a limit. What we're willing to put up with before we break.""When was the last time a book just completely slayed me, cutting me so deep and evoking such strong emotions? It feels like my heart has been filled, then broken, filled, then broken. In the end, I'm stunned by what I read.It Ends with Usstarts out innocently enough. We follow the courtship of Lily and Ryle. He is handsome, successful, and so thoroughly smitten by Lily he can barely think. He makes advances while claiming he doesn't do relationships. She rebuffs him while secretly pining for him. Really, it's all fun and a bit frivolous, your standard romance.But then we arrive at the core of this story, which I won't spoil because it's best to read it from Colleen Hoover's own words. I'll just say that the main topic in here is something that a lot of books try to tackle, but very few do right. Hoover's portrayal is brutal and compelling, and it's hard to look away. Her nuanced approach makes the whole thing ring true, and she brings a humanity to it that is both sobering and heartbreaking.I read this book years ago when it first came out, and I remember thinking highly of it, though not much else. So when I read it again this time, I admit I was shaken by how hard it hit me. I think it's because I'm older now and have more experience with love and relationships, so I'm able to appreciate this story even more.My suggestions if you're going to read this book: have a box of tissues ready and don't skip the author's note at the end. I sobbed my way to the finishing line, then read the author's note and sobbed some more. This is a riveting and worthwhile read, though at times difficult, and it showcases Colleen Hoover at her best, taking her contemporary new adult genre and elevating it to soaring heights.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Starts with UsVerityReminders of HimRegretting YouUgly LoveLayla~~~~~~~~~~~~",5
275,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","Phenomenal!This book will make you fall in love, rip your heart out and force you to reconsider your preconceived ideas about abuse. This is the most moving book that I've read in a LONG time. It was absolutely addicting, but so difficult at times. I don't cry very often, but this one had me crying big, fat tears.It's been a couple of days since I finished 'It Ends With Us' and I'm still thinking about Lily's story. It's one that'll hang with you. In so many ways, her story gutted me. Yet, it was also inspiring.Lily grows up in an abusive household. After watching her mother suffer for years at the hand of her father, she tells herself that she'll never allow any man to treat her that way. She grows into a strong and independent woman, leaving behind the horrors of her childhood...Or so she thinks.Despite everything she's promised herself, Lily finds herself in an abusive relationship. The behavior and cycle is so insidious that you almost can't believe what is happening. Ms. Hoover manages to weave the violence into a relationship that is otherwise seemingly perfect. It is so skillfully written that you won't want to believe what you've read.I found myself making excuses for the abuser. I didn't want to believe that he wouldn't change. For the first time, I could understand why women make excuses for abusers. I can only imagine how strong that pull must be in reality if I felt so strongly about a fictional character.I am in awe of Lily. Her strength and conviction blew me away. I don't think I would've been strong enough to do what she did. She was an amazing character.This was a beautiful and heartbreaking book. I recommend it to everyone. It is a must read.",5
276,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","at the beginning i told myself i knew what i was in for and i was completely wrong. there are very few times, personally, when a book feels like it’s become a part of you. like you can physically feel it become a core book that you know you’d never stop thinking, talking, and recommending to those that would enjoy it. this is definitely that booki don’t think this book could have been written more perfectly. from the writing, the plot, to characters…nothing is fabricated. it is raw emotion and realistic.you fall in love with Lily. You want the best for her and you fight with her from cover to cover. i adored her character and reading her journey.i was so scared that this would end it a way that would have been unrealistic or just covered up in hearts and butterflies like we didn’t just witness 300+pages of trauma. but it didn’t, it quite literally ends with us. and you won’t know what that means until the very end.yes i cried. a lot. all for different reasons but i ended the book with the biggest smile on my face. it truly felt like i was on a journey with Lily, like i was vicariously living through her.this is definitely a favorite book of mine that i’ll be taking to the grave. i loved it so much and if anyone has anything negative to say about it you are simply wrong. i get the hype now and i was blown away. it went above and beyond from my expectations.if you plan to read this book, look up TWs because it’s very very intense. more intense than i realized. do not romanticize these characters because that’s just speaking over their trauma and experiences. and READ THE AUTHORS NOTE, it tells you how this came about. every page of this is worth it, if you can handle the subject matter of course.",5

290,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","If you need me I'll be sweeping up all the pieces of my shattered heart. Dear God! It's amazing how you can read a story that is simultaneously gut wrenching and beautiful. I'll be honest, I managed to make it through this ENTIRE book without shedding a single tear... until I hit CoHo's note/acknowledgements at the end and ugly cried. The fact that this story had so much basis on real life events that meant so much to her shined through in her writing.Clearly you can guess the ending of the story (to some degree) by the title, but a majority of what makes this story so breathtaking is the journey there. ""It Ends With Us"" caused me to look at domestic abuse in ways I never allowed myself to in the past. As a society we are quick to judge women (and men) who stay in abusive relationships without taking into account what the process really is like for them. We get a slight glimpse into the fragile situation of how incredibly difficult it is to leave a dangerous relationship when you love the person who is causing you harm. I won't say more for fear of ruining the reading experience for someone else, but this book was so much more than a flimsy romance novel. Highly recommended! (Maybe I'll stop ugly crying by the time you've finished reading it.)",5
291,"It Ends with Us (It Ends with Us, #1)","You guys are always telling me this author writes vaguely shitty romance novels and is unbelievably overhyped... and yet this masterpiece exists? I call bullshit because this was masterful.If you have read this book and also follow my reviews, you know the topic of abuse is one I sort of talk about a lot. this book got it right. this book got it so, so right.So let’s talk about why.→ character work ←I knew I would love Lily from the moment she stood up at her abusive father’s funeral and refused to speak. And oh boy, was I right. Lily works so well as a protagonist because sheisn’tthe archetype. She has been through abuse herself and she is so, so sure it would never happen to her. She would leave if even one thing happened. She would. ...But then she doesn’t. She reads as absolutely, totally real. And her character development? Fucking iconic.→ friendship focus ←Something that really bothers me a lot in romances like this is that a romance tends tosavethe protagonist, and I think this book - despite marketing that made me concerned this trope would rear its ugly head -does the opposite.The lead friendship here between Lily and Alys is so 20/10 and soimportant. And even though thereisa touch of romance, I think the book is very explicit about itnot being healthy for Lily to jump right into a new relationship.I appreciate that a lot.→ narrative treatment ←I think this is one of the only books I have ever read that actually seems to understand thatabuse is a mortal sin.The wild thing is, aside from his moments of extreme rage, Rylin never appears to bethatbad of a guy. He apologizes every time. He continuously seems to account for Lily’s feelings. But his actions against her areenough. There is no question in the narrative on whether she was being unempathetic: Lily wasrightto leave, no matter how he treated her in the aftermath. And I think that means a lot to me, how his character is nuanced but also irredeemable for Lily.I mean, aside from these three things, everything about this novel was basically good - the writing is extremely clean and easy-to-read, there are some really really funny moments, the romance thatdoesend up occurring is genuinely sweet, and it's overall a win - but on a personal level? I am destroyed. This book is not just good, this book is Fantastic. and that's my opinion. goodnight.Blog|Goodreads|Twitter|Youtube",5
292,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","3.5 ⭐️ The ending has left me broken. I cried. I had a heart attack. And now I’m staring into space like life has no meaning. I am unwell.""The first year is when some of us lose our lives. The second year is when the rest of us lose our humanity.""Prepare to join the revolution.WHAT TO EXPECT:✨ adult romantasy✨ book 2 of the Empyrean Series✨ established romance (but they're stubborn idiots)✨ war college setting✨ dragon riders✨ magic✨ unique world building✨ complex politics✨ found family✨ chronic illness rep✨ action-packed✨ high stakes✨ 2.5/5 🌶️ (3 explicit spicy scenes)✨ massive cliffhanger✨ TW: physical torture, imprisonment, brutal injuries, perilous situations, blood, dismemberment, burning, murder, death, grief, ow drama.My Thoughts:It's been one week since I finished Iron Flame and I am still unwell. No matter how hard I try, I cannot get this book out of my head, all because of those last 25 pages . . . ⁠How dare Rebecca do this to us, knowing we have to wait god knows how long for book 3. 😭⁠Did I enjoy it?Yes.⁠Was it better than Fourth Wing?No.⁠But will I continue the series?Abso-f*cking-lutely!⁠This book is really hard for me to rate because while I enjoyed the story and the ending, there were a lot of technical (plot/character) issues that definitely hindered my overall enjoyment. So, even though I'm giving it 4-stars in Goodreads, this was a 3.5 star book and I've just bumped up my rating a little because of my emotional reaction at the ending.*SPOILERS AHEAD*⁠What I liked:⁠The story is action-packed from start to finish, so you'll never want to put this book down.Iron Flame is divided into two parts. Part one takes place at Basgiath War College and part two focuses on the Revolution. There's 623 pages total, and I genuinely felt like I read two books because so much happens. I'm glad I took detailed notes because I've already forgotten a lot and I know I'll need to refer to them before starting book 3.The continued world-building is fascinating.Like I said, this story is non-stop and that includes uncovering new information about the history and politics of this world. We now have a solid idea on what's really happening on the continent, however, there's still so many unanswered questions about the past (before the unification), the venin, and the Empyrean. I love this phase of a long series because there's still so much we don't know or understand, and I can't wait to see everything unfold and come together in the next few books. ⁠These characters are some of my favorites and need to be protected at all costs.Violet is still a badass. Xaden is still daddy. Tairn is fucking hilarious. And Andarna is the sassiest bitch in the realm. I do wish she wasn't away for half the story though.Violet internally struggled a lot more in this book by bottling up her emotions, distancing herself from her friends, and taking on too much responsibility (like researching the wards).Violet is just as strong and determined as she was in Fourth Wing, but in Iron Flame, we see the toll everything takes on her. I'm glad that by part two she starts to lean on her friends more, but I'm worried how she's going to manage after the events at the end of book 2. There's only so much a person can take, and I fear Violet may break at some point in the future. I'm looking forward to seeing how her character develops in the rest of the series.PS: Violet during the torture scenes and and final battle when she saves Sawyer was impressive as hell! I respect her so much and strive to be just as badass.Xaden is still top tier book boyfriend material.Look, he is not perfect. In fact, I'm a little pissed at him for constantly putting the responsibility of sharing truths on Violet throughout this story when he could have easily been open and forthcoming. BUT I DON'T CARE. That man is just so damn confident, intelligent, sexy and loyal to Violet, that the minute he's on the page, I lose my damn mind. And when he writes letters to Violet . . . I melted. He isn't even a romantic guy, but did one of the most romantic things in the world.There's also a lot of side characters (both old and new) that I enjoyed getting to know better:Rhi, Ridoc, Imogen, Bodhi, Mira, Brennan, Sawyer, Jesinia, Sloane, and Maren. There's also a bunch of characters I loathe and wanted to see die a slow and painful death. Some don't. Some do. *cough* Varrish *cough*. Fuck that guy. But I can't complain, because everyone likes a good villain and Iron Flame definitely had a few!PS: I don't hate Dain anymore.Obviously, what he did was absolutely horrible and I don't think I can ever truly forgive him for the role he played in Liam's death. BUT we have to remember, he didn't know what was going to happen and seems to be very repentant for it all. Do I trust him? Hell no. But do I think he's a bad guy? No. I still think he needs to redeem himself, so I'll be curious to see where his character goes from here.Those few chapters with imaginary Liam were everything.😭 Liam's death absolutely broke me and still haunts me to this day. So seeing him again, in the way that we did, gave me some closure. But this entire situation has me wondering (THEORY AHEAD), what if Violet's second signent is her talking to the dead?! We know a lot of history has been lost or written out of existence, so I'm wondering if the only way Violet can find answers is through some power of communicating with the dead?RIP Mama Sorrengail.For all of Fourth Wing and most of Iron Flame, I hated her. And honestly, even after everything, I still don't like her very much. However, while I know she wasn't a great person or mom, I understand her choices. Again, I don't agree with them, but she really thought she was protecting her children. I wept when she died, not because I am sad she's dead, but for Brennan, Mira, and Violet. They now know that even if their mom was misguided, her intention was driven by the love of her children and now that she's gone, they'll mourn what was and what could have been. They each had such different responses and I felt them all.The ending . . .I mean, I've already talked enough about it but DAMN, I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. I predicted General Sorrengail would die but I thought maybe Violet would get taken by the Sage or something. So yeah, I am still completely shocked by that ending, maybe even a little pissed, and will be sending Rebecca Yarros my next therapy bill.What I didn't like:This is a small gripe, but why are they using the Julian Calendar in this fantasy world?I mean, Rebecca created a completely new world but couldn't come up with different names for the months of the year? Every time it mentioned December or July, it totally took me out of the story.⁠The pacing was frantic and for what?So much happens, yet, at the same time, I didn't feel like a lot happened to push the overarching plot forward. The highlights are: Violet goes back to school, Violet tries to learn about wards, Violet gets tortured, Violet and half the college goes back to revolution headquarters, Xaden and Violet get the luminary, and then the final battle happens. We didn't need 600+ pages just to give us that. @listenwithbritt mentioned in an IG reel that the pacing felt like she was watching a TV series, and I totally agree. Every few chapters felt like a TV episode with some small task that needed to be accomplished or there was a hurdle to overcome; then it would get quickly resolved and they'd move onto the next thing. There were a lot of small subplots that were unimportant and felt like filler scenes. So the constant bombardment of action, angst, or mystery was a bit overwhelming and it was hard to decipher at the time what scenes were really important for the overall story. For example, what real value did the survival class or the death hike scenes offer? In my opinion, not much but creating small moments of conflict to keep the story moving along. Maybe Rebecca wrote Iron Flame this way since the series is getting turned into a TV series by Amazon.The story was too dense.There were too many new names, history, and general knowledge to really keep track of what was important. And there were quite a few things that weren't fully explained or were overlooked. Pair that with the frantic pacing, and there wasn't enough time to fully digest all this new information before we were forced to move on to the next part of the story. I had to read slowly, re-read sections, and take notes to keep track of everything. Doing that for 16 hours was a bit overwhelming and exhausting.I HATED the other woman (OW) drama.It’s a tacky, cheap, and overdone romance conflict and totally unnecessary. There was also a big inconsistency surrounding it. First off, Bodhi mentions Cat early on by saying how Xaden has never cared so much about anyone, not even Cat, which alluded that at some point Xaden was involved with and potentially cared deeply for another woman. But later, Xaden says Cat could die for all he cares and he has never loved her. So why was Violet lead to believe he had feelings for another woman at some point? Solely to create drama between Xaden and Violet. And why didn’t Violet ask Xaden about Cat the minute she found out about her? If she did this, she wouldn’t have been blindsided by it all CHAPTERS LATER when they went to get the luminary from Cat’s family.Also, Xaden should have been transparent about Cat when it first came up so Violet didn't spend chapters feeling insecure. And the way Cat was a nasty bitch to Violet the entire book, but then randomly decides she's cool with her after Violet saves her life was so anticlimactic. This was probably the weakest sub-plot of the entire book. And if there's more OW or OM drama in the rest of the series, I will fucking riot. Xaden better not use Cat to drive Violet away in the next book.I was underwhelmed by the romance.Honestly, their relationship was stagnant because they didn't have enough time together in this book. With Xaden being away for most of the first part and then they end up doing their own things for the Revolution during the second part, there was little time for them to really grow deeper as a couple.I also expected more groveling by Xaden at the beginning, but instead he makes Violet responsible for his honesty by saying she has to be the one to ask questions and then he'll answer. But for the entire book, Violet doesn't ask him anything! So, she doesn't get any answers! Meanwhile, Xaden just sits around, not communicating with Violet, when he could easily take the initiative to share his truths. Their lack of communication was so frustrating and was definitely done to create drama for the story. It was dumb and lazy writing. They could have easily set aside time to really hash out the issues of their relationship and dive deep into the secrets Xaden is keeping, but they don't.The smut also didn't hit this time.For the size of this book and the fact Xaden and Violet are an already established relationship, I expected at least five sex scenes, but we got three. Okay, I'll admit, the throne scene was hot but only because of the setting. I wasn't excited by the dirty talk and, yeah, the smut was just lackluster in my opinion. It wasn't bad, just forgettable.It didn't feel like any character had enough time to go through any real development.I think this occurred because there were so many new characters introduced that the attention of the story was split. Or maybe it's also because the story is in Violet's POV and she pulled away from everyone, so since she wasn't as ingrained in their lives, she didn't notice changes/growth? I don't know, but I wish we could have had more time with Xaden, Rhi, and Sloane.There were a few things that didn't really get explained.For example, why wouldn't Brennan encourage Violet to do research on wards? Violet was trained as a Scribe and would be an excellent person to assign for this task. I get he didn't think they would have enough time to figure it out and he thought they should focus on making more weapons, but no one assigned Violet a mission, so why have her do nothing instead of possibly finding a solution to win the war? His logic wasn't full-proof. Also, the end where Brennan fixes the wardstone. . . we spent the entire book trying to understand wards and then figure out how to mend them and somehow Brennan does this but we don't see how? It better be explained in the next book and not glossed over. Also, why did Xaden become venin? In the dream he has, the Sage said it would save Violet from dying while she was draining herself for the wardstone, but I don't see how thats true. If you have any ideas please let me know. And random but can someone please make a timeline of when Xaden would have been able to have a relationship with Cat? Because according to my math, he would have been, like, 14 years old! There are even more situations that needed an explanation but I don't have the energy to go through them all.Overall, Iron Flame was a decent sequel. I enjoyed it. I was entertained. But it was messy, and left me wanting more and less at the same time. It should have been shorter, the plot should have been cleaned up a bit, and we should have spent more time with our favorite characters instead of being introduced to a shit ton of new characters (whom I'm still not sure are important). It really is entertaining though, so if you enjoyed Fourth Wing, you'll probably enjoy this one, or at the very least, be able to push through it.

293,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","– 4 starsSONG:Power is Power – SZA, The Weeknd, Travis Scottthis book was my most anticipated release of the year and I wasn’t disappointed 🙏 while I adore Fourth Wing and gave it 5 stars and this book “only” 4 stars for various reasons i’ll be listing later, I still very much enjoyed this book as a whole and I loved being back in this world … Violetxaden, Tairn and Andarna my beloved ones came back to me 🧚‍♀️that cliffhanger oh my god??? what the fuck was that? I didn’t see that coming and while it wasn’t Zodiac Academy cliffhanger level of bad, cuz let’s be real nothing will be as horrific as Shadow Princess or Heartless Sky cliffhanger 💀 Iron Flame ending had me spiralling.. how tf will this issue be resolvedIFit can even be resolved I’M NOT OKAY 😭😭😭Fourth Wing was so action packed and fast paced with lots of “OMG”-moments like when Violet bonded not one but two dragons, finding out the dragon’s power, certain sacrifices etc. So compared to the first book Iron Flame is much slower plotwise. It starts where Fourth Wing left off and continues with Violet and co. going back to Basgiath College for their second year and act like mentors for the new first year students.🗡️VIOLET SORRENGAIL(h) 🗡️”Violence, remember it’s only the body that’s fragile. You are unbreakable.”I love Violet so much, but I think she struggled a lot in this book with her position in this world and what her purpose is. Violet has the best intentions at heart, but feels like she is failing everyone and I just wanted to give her a hug this whole book 😭 when she said that she never failed anything in her life but now she keeps failing and making the wrong decisions I felt for her!!But Vi’s struggle were actually the part that made me love her more. Yes, she did make some questionable decisions in this book, but that’s what makes her character so realistic for me. She tries her best and sometimes her best isn’t enough, but this girlnevergives up. She will keep standing up no matter how many times she gets kicked down. She will find the solution to the problem no matter how many hours she will need to research, but she will do the work.That scene with her Varrish and Nolan and a certain other character whose name I can’t name killed me 😭 it was so painful to read.. Violet was so strong for enduring everything and not losing her mind completely.. I would have folded so quickly 🌚 Violet Sorrengail best girl. There is a reason she bonded not one, but two dragons. 💅🔹XANDEN RIORSON(H) 🔹“Violet.” His gaze rakes over my face, lingering on my cheeks. I love the way he says my name. Sure, it’s the alcohol overruling my logic, but I want to hear him say it again. “Lieutenant Riorson.”LIEUTENANT RIORSON Y’ALL. If you think WINGLEADER Xaden was hot wait til you get Xaden as a lieutenant that just hits differently 🛐 He was so hot in this book.Xaden has still so many secrets we don’t know about and I think there is still so much to his story. Like where did his mother disappear? I’m still so intrigued by his character and now even more after that ending… I didn’t see that coming and I’m still shocked. I wish we would get more Xaden POVs in the books because the one at the end is never enough… with that ending I hope that Xaden will be more of a focus in the next book, cause I just want to know more about him.🐉TAIRN & ANDARNA (DRAGONS)🐉“A rolling dismount would tear you limb from limb on impact,” he retorts.“You don’t know that,” Andarna counters with what seems to be her new default form of conversation—telling Tairn he’s wrong. A growl rumbles through Tairn’s chest, vibrating the saddle beneath me and the harness that holds Andarna to his chest.“I’d watch it,” I tell her, biting back a smile. “He might get tired and drop you.”“His pride would never allow it.”“Says the dragon who spent twenty minutes refusing to put on her harness,” Tairn fires back.It would be a huge lie if I’d say I haven’t missed my sunshine princess Andarna in this book, because I did, but eventually all babies have to grow up and Andarna became a teenager 🥺 her angsty teenager attitude towards Tairn had me laughing my ass off. I love their relationship so much and they are the best father-daughter duo. Their bond is so precious! When Andarna said she wanted to be just like Tairn, because he is loyal, fierce and strong it made me so emotional 😭😭 And to my grumpy, firerce, strong and loyal dragon Tairn.. I can only say that I thought I couldn’t love him more after Fourth Wing, but I do now. The way Tairn protects Violet and stands by her side is everything. The relationship that the dragons have with their riders is *chef’s kiss*🧚THE ROMANCE🧚I meant what I said on the parapet. Even when I’m not with you, there’s only youMy violetxaden heart was so happy!! I mean I knew Violet would be really stubborn about the Xaden lying to her thing and would hold it against him for quite some time, but I loved the angst that created. But Xaden is completely smitten with her and we love to see an obsessed boy. Vi doesn’t think that he would choose her over the revolution, but she doesn’t realized that Xaden would burn down the world for her 😌 he is not like that rule-following loser Dain .. Xaden would break every rule for her and the way Xaden is so worried for Vi and wants to protect her has my heart melting into a puddle 🥰Also can we talk about Xaden writing Violet letters while he is away?? that is so romantic and had me going 🥺 I only wished we could have read more of his letters and not only small excerps. Don’t be shy Rebecca give us the full content.👫SIDE CHARACTERS👫Rhiannon:my queen i love you, it took me forever to remember you name, but now you better survive until the end or i will personally hunt Rebecca til the end of the worldRidoc:my comedic king i love youImogen: i love you my other kickass queenDain:fuck you, i haven’t forgiven you and i don’t think i willJesinia:what a cutie, i like her and she better stays loyal to Violet and doesn’t betray herCat:FUCK YOU, but in capital letters.Varrish:oh i hope someone fucks you with a 10 inch pole i fucking hate you. that c*nt… why does every magical school has a Professor Umbridge character that is so detestable. This man will answer for all his sins and the atrocities he commited against Violet. I hope this loser never finds a moment of peace.to the rest of the side characters: you were either irrelevant, i couldn’t remember you’re names or i refuse to remember to name, cause you going to die either way in this book or later.👯‍♀️VIOLET & MIRA & BRENNAN👯‍♀️the scene where Mira finds out that Brennan is alive and punches him in the face lives in my mind rent free. That’s my girl lmao cause I would react the same way if I’d find out one of my sibling pretended to be death for the last six years. I’D BE LIVID.But it was great to see all Sorrengail siblings back together. I love seeing them all together and get a glimpse of their different dynamics with each other. When Mira and Brennan were fighting and Violet was just standing next to them and felt like their little sister again dksdskd 😭 I love them and they are all badasses in their own way.🔻WHY IRON FLAME WAS WEAKER THAN FOURTH WING IMO🔻↠ if Fourth Wing was Catching Fire (The Hunger Games) then I’d say that Iron Flame is Mockingjay in terms of action and pace. As I mentioned abovethis book is much more slower paced. It’s one of those books where a lot happens, but at the same time nothing at all, because they are trying to establish the rebellion, gather their tropes, find out more information how to raise the wards etc. So it deals with the characters getting to class and learning about magic etc. While a lot of people still die in this book, Iron Flame just didn’t feel as high staked imo as Fourth Wing did. Violet and her friends survived all the trials and first year, so I didn’t feel like I was constantly on the edge of my seat not knowing what will happen next. Don’t get me wrong there were many scenes that HAD ME STRESSED OUT and sweating, because it was intense, but it wasn’t intense as a whole as Fourth Wing and didn’t me give me as much nostalgia as Fourth Wing did.↠ theinfo-dumpingwas a bit much in this book. I think Fourth Wing had the perfect amount of world building and information. Iron Flame had a lot of information because the characters are going to class and learn about new magic and trying to gather info on how to raise wards and power the wardstone etc. and I get that it was important, but seeing them look for information, just to try it and fail and then having to continue their search was a bit exhausting.↠ some of the themes in this book were repetitive. Since Violet and Xaden couldn’t see each other a lot in the first half of the book I ate up every scenes they had together, but the things they were fighting over were always the same.. Violet not being able to trust him, them not being able to proper communicate with each other, Violet complaining about Xaden lying and having too many secrets .. that was pretty much the root of every single fight they had. Their push and pull was a bit tiring to read at the beginning cause they had the same argument over and over again.CONCLUSIONFourth Wing was a perfect book for me and a 10 outta 10 so even though Iron Flame didn’t reach that level for me and had quite some flaws, it was still an enjoyable book to read and I love love love this world so much with the dragon and magic and harry potter vibes. I love this series and after that brutal ending I need the next book in my hands right now. Praying that we don’t have to wait a whole year for the next book to come out.P.S: What is the author going to write in the next THREE books?! We are already in the middle of fighting against the venin and wyvern and I hope RY doesn’t drag out the storyline too much and makes it another Zodiac Academy situation 💀┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑THE EMPYREAN SERIES#1 Fourth Wing – 5 stars#2Iron Flame– 4 stars┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙",4
294,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","Because love, at its root, is hope. Hope for tomorrow. Hope for what could be. Hope that someone you've entrusted your everything to will cradle and protect it. And hope? That shit is harder to kill than a dragon.Well, fuck🥲That being said, I promised myself I'd finish my current readings before starting this one, but FoMo was a bitch and then, would you believe that, I tripped and fell into Xadaddy's arms.Silly, clumsy me.Iron Flame was alright, but I'm not crazy about it.I found the writing even more YAish than it was in Fourth Wing and I, painfully, have to admit I feel the same about the romance.I don't know if maybe, when I first read Fourth Wing, I was in a place, mentally speaking, where my reader needs were more than met despite the flaws, but it seems like I can't overlook them with the sequel.Being completely honest, the plot does pick up after the first half and the romance has its up and downs all through the story, but it never reaches the point where I felt like giving up on it completely.The smut was fine and the tension well written, but I'm not a fan of Yarros's idea of spicy dialogues.The one liners, sometimes, made me cringe a little, and the characterization of the main characters left me a tad confused, at times, especially at the beginning. I couldn't follow the story properly because I felt like Violet was thinking one thing then acting in a completely opposite way.Speaking of Violet...When I read FW, I thought Yarros'd made her a bit of a Mary Sue, but that was okay, because she had obvious flaws, even she was aware of, to balance her randomly having every special skill on the menu and succeding in every single task she was burdened with.Iron Flame Violet is a total badass and she's definitely grown a lot, but she also feels a little incomplete and rough at the edges. I don't know if it's intentional and/or tied to her future evolution, but I wouldn't have minded her being more confident, especially when it comes to her relationship with Xaden.Xaden is still daddy, in case you're asking, and he was a total dreamboat, the ultimate book boyfriend from start to finish.Like I've mentioned before, I wasn't really sure about the romance, at first. I wanted more grovelling and Violet's constant thirsting over Xaden's fine behind gave me a headache. It gave me major early Tory/Darius vibes, and if you're a fan of Zodiac Academy, you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, things took a pleasant turn when I reached the second part and I wasn't only rooting for them, I was absolutely feral when everything mined their eventual happiness.This works for the plot as well. In the first half, I wasn't really enjoying myself and could count on one hand the moments I actually found interesting.But then shit hit the fan, twists started piling up and every page turned was an angsty fest I totally wanted to attend. I devoured the second half in hours and when I reached the end, just felt like staring at the wall.And have a mojito or two.I definitely didn't see THAT coming.Another thing I really appreciated, aside from the chef's kiss perfect action scenes and THE SASSY DRAGONS (omg my baby Andarna!!!), were the secondary characers. Violet and Xaden's friends deserve their own books - Rhi in particular <3<3<3< - and I definitely hope the sequels will focus on them more, especially because some characters are only now starting to blossom and they seem particularly interesting.I also would like to take advantage of this topic to admit I never really hated Dain. I'm pretty passive when it comes to him, but I swear to god, if RY takesthatdirection, I'm gonna throw a fit.Overall, this was, for me, a decent sequel, albeit an unnecessarily long one.If you loved FW but are having trouble with it like I did, I recommend pushing through it.All in all, it's pretty worth it.I'll leave under the spoiler tag some sort of disclaimer because, even though I usually try my best to stay clear of any kind of drama and hate brining real life politics into my bookish heaven, I've been harassed for a couple days both in public and in private because of my choice to give this book a chance, so for the first and last time in my permanence here on this site, I'll go out of my usual way and discuss things I usually never discuss on GR, after all.I'm aware of the controversy surrounding this author and this book series.I'm not ignoring the problem, I'm simply choosing to keep my thoughts on the matter private and my general beliefs silent, except for serious situations that require me to speak up about them out loud or environments where I know judgement or opposition would come in a respectful manner and not in the form of bullying and name calling.Unfortunately, that doesn't always seem to be the case here on GR, these days.I'm publicly choosing to read this book acknowledging what's going on behind the scenes, and my review will simply be that: an objective and honest book review like the hundreds I've written before, as my hobby and favorite pastime.It won't nor shouldn't be my opinion telling others what they can or can't, should or shouldn't read in their free time and how to use their money or to consume the media they purchased.If I had that type of influence, I most certainly wouldn't be spending my spare moments reviewing books for free.Iam choosing, for myself, to leave a review that has nothing to do with the person who wrote this book or her political views, and it's between me, my objectivity and my conscience to decide how this will play out.I don't need to state this, but before anyone starts throwing around terms and essays, my support and prayers go out to people who are suffering. I chose to do something about the delicate and important matters we're discussing (and those conflicts and natural catastrophes I rarely see discussed here, because, guess what? 1) it's GoodREADS not GoodWORLDWIDENEWS and 2) the world sucks everywhere and it's been sucking for a really long time), but you won't hear me being vocal about it, because I've learnt you don't have to boast about your actions and contributions to be a good person. That sometimes those who are lousy and loud with words, just like the idea of being good without really acting on it.I'm choosing to help whoever I feel needs helping in a way that's suited to my personal beliefs and that has nothing to do with the books I prefer to engage with.I'm choosing to remain neutral when it comes to sharing political views on a site dedicated to book tracking; war and death are a reality I'll never turn away from.And if separating art from the artist isn't a tolerated choice, I hope keeping my private life and my reader life separate will be more understandable.I hope those who disagree with my choice to refrain from sharing my political views, will give me the benefit of the doubt, as I'll try to do with them and their ideals.If you wanna talk politics or discuss what an author has or hasn't done, my comment section isn't the place. If you also wanna unfriend/unfollow me for this or because any of my reading/life choices make you uncomfortable, please go ahead. No hard feelings on my part, really. It'll be sad to see some I considered close friends go, but I understad. It was nice knowing you and I wish you all the best.But if you guys wanna have a mature chat about things that matter to you, my inbox is always open.Friend or foe, as long as there's reciprocal respect, as long as educating others means patiently and kindly exposing facts and not trying to shove what you think is the truth down other people's throat, I'll more than gladly listen to anything you have to say.Compare ideas, compare beliefs, but please keep it clean.The moment things eventually go out of hand, the moment I see death threats or that anyone, along with their political/religious affiliations - whatever those may be, because we don't discriminate people who haven't actively perpetrated hate crimes in this house - is harassed or shamed for their personal choices, I'll simply report, block, delete and move on with my life.Harass away, my child, if you think that'll profit you and the ideas you're perpetrating.Fight hate with hate, if you think that's the solution to all problems.Just let others do their thing and remember that everyone's most likely living a reality you know nothing about.But, most of all, remember who the real enemy is.",3
295,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","3.75 starsAs a person with ADHD, the jokes are on me because I didn't even remember any location and the super-descriptive long ass paragraphs about borders and locations seriously made my head spin and I'm glad I finished this! 😭I actually preferBook 1a lot more than this book because that was more clear and exciting than this one. Not that this one wasn't great, but it didn't give the same feelings as the first one did when it hooked me instantly because of the Parapet scene.Many things didn't work for me.The start of this book wasn't as exciting... (she was eating freaking biscuits). And Brennan's revealation and all were just so avg and boring? A lot of info dumps too. The Dragons made this book better.The first 30% of this book is filled with 'You don't trust me enough' drama between Xaden and Vi, which was seriously getting on my nerves.I get that she's hurt, but she was being absolutely ridiculous, demanding info while withholding it as a form of retaliation. Her inner monologue about being a 'bad friend' and always 'feeling guilty' for lying again and again was constantly on repeat. NO ACTION NOTHING NADA. I felt bad for Rhiannon as she tried again and again and always checked up on her. Rhiannon deserved better! 😭🔪SPOILERS:🔪So, I'll start with my fav,—TAIRN CARRIED THIS WHOLE BOOK. PERIOD. He's so damn possessive, and I'm dying at how powerful and protective he is of Violet! He's so freaking savage, I can write so much about him! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS DRAGON 😌💕“You do not have the right to burn what is mine.”“Apologize,” Tairn demands, his voice low and sharp. “I’m sorry!” Varrish’s voice breaks. “Apologize to the one Andarna deemed worthy of her bond.""“I chose you last year for that brilliance, and now you’d like to be congratulated like it’s something new? How odd.” “You’re impossible to impress.” “I’m a dragon, a Black Morningstartail. The descendant of—”—Tairn's and Andarna's banter was so fun ughhhhh I really enjoyed that!!!! 🥹 Both are so sarcastic and witty now! Andarna my cutieeee 🤭“Scratch her eyes out,” Andarna suggests. “Really. The eyes are the softest tissue. Just jab your thumbs in there—” “Andarna! Use some common sense,” Tairn snaps. “The kneecaps are a much easier target.”“Can you carry a luminary?” “That question insults me.” “Can you carry a luminary while insulted?” she prods”""Adolescent.""—How can I not fall for Xaden when he says things like:“She’s worth a dozen of me.""“I will happily watch Aretia burn to the fucking ground again if it means you live.""“I’m in love with you. I have been since the night the snow fell in your hair and you kissed me for the first time. I’m grateful my life is tied to yours because it means I won’t have to face a day without you in it. My heart only beats as long as yours does, and when you die, I’ll meet Malek at your side.—I'm dying at how much Dain is roasted in this book! 💀 It's like the author read all of our reviews about him.“He’s trying desperately for Xaden’s charisma and coming up woefully short”“Garrick has always been my best friend. His father was my father’s aide, which in a way makes him my Dain, except trustworthy”“He’s not slowing down,” I murmur. Part of me hopes Dain falls off.”Me when Jack mf Barlowe entered:jdkskdhaha please he had no business pretending to be kind 😭 I was cackling! like IMAGINE a nice jack barlowe? *snort*. A wise man once said, ""once a bitch, always a bitch""TOXICITY AT ITS PEAK:Xaden and Violet went from being a couple who support each other to being borderline toxic. They were restricted to meet only two days, and it was spent fighting! THEY FOUGHT AT EVERY CHANCE THEY GOT!""you didn't tell.""""you didn't ask.""THIS SHOULD BE THE BLURB. This freaking drama grated on my nerves, and I was tired of how much this phrase was used. LIKE STOP? Everybody knew that Xaden is not sharing everything just to protect her life, and to a certain extent, I understand Violet, and I agree with her.but she's being so immature and whiny, and I swear this book just kind of ruined her character in many ways because she was always back to this old topic, and they constantly fought each other, and Violet constantly defied Xaden again and again (as in risking her life) and then made up eventually.The author really tried to put angst into their story with smut, but tbh I DO NOT PREFER THEM AS A COUPLE (at least not rn). The love was too quick, and the amount of trust issues, insecurities, and fights they had was so wrong and unhealthy. Xaden was being protective of her and hiding truths from her for her OWN SAFETY! and saying from experience, fantasy girlies do not like overprotective bfs. AND ADDING CATRIONA IN IT? That was the worst! The whole ex-jealousy thing was insane. and if this keeps going on, I don't think XadenVi will be the endgame (there are 5 books ffs)• side characters:For me,Rhiannonstole the show. She's so mature and amazing? and I love her sm! How she kept calm and been patient and supported Violet, and she's so damn skillful? SHE DESERVED APPRECIATION AND I'M GLAD SHE GOT IT. She's super genius and literally figured most of the things out and told Violet that 'she'll wait for her to tell her everything' like GURLLLLL 🥺🥰🤭💕Dain'sreasoning was prettyyy... reasonable? I knew and already predicted what he would say, and it turned out I was correct! I liked his redemption arc though and realized that I cursed him way too much 😂 ok, Dain, you can be back on my okay-ish list. and HE HAD NO RIGHT TO COPY XADEN'S LINES 💀AARIC GRAYCASTLEY'ALL (not his real name but will do) jekdjs he's so hot? 😭 GREEN EYES ARE A BIG WEAKNESS, and I truly see him getting bigger parts in the other books cuz duh he's so freaking amazing and .... royal. He's the next Liam 🥹 (sans the death part). HE CARES FOR VIOLET TOO, DADDY ISSUES AND IS CUTIEEE! I low-key ship him and Violet together hhahahaha and pls no sloaneAaric.Sloanewas seriously just different than Liam lol! I expected too much, but she was not that important in this book besides Violet constantly checking up on her. Ngl some scenes/hallucinations of Liam made me so happy and sad. 🥹Rodichdkejs he's so good, and his character damn he's actually pretty amazing! I'm glad his character got recognized a lot in this book!Varrishsoooo weirddd sooo creepyyyyy! 👺 I hated him so much and what he did with Violet? HE DESERVED A PAINFUL DEATH WTH! I loved when he begged violet on his knees like bishhhh you deserve that.General SorrengailMOTHER. 🫡 The quote where she told her husband THAT EVERYTHING SHE EVER DID WAS JUST TO SAVE HER CHILDREN! 💔“Most generals dream of dying in service to their kingdom. But you know me better than that, my love.When I fall, it will be for one reason only: to protect our children.”Now, all said, I truly think that this book was too long, and a lot of things were super tough and descriptive like: runes...?what the fuck were those? I read many times and I came with a seizure because why are they even added? A second reread would help, but I won't go there anytime soon. A lot of elements of this book were so weird that I prefer book 1 A LOT!what the actual fuckery? (the ending ofcourse)I can finally sleep now as I haven't slept more than 5 hours just to finish this book.I'm sorry but I didn't know about this author being zionist when I read this book and I didnt contribute to her financially and all as I read the pirated version. I'm not supporting gen0cide at all.RATINGS:• Fourth Wing– 5 stars• Iron Flame – 3.75 stars",3
296,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","|| 2.0 stars ||Well, damn. This was incredibly disappointing...I don’t even really know where to start with this review, because I feel like I have so many complaints.First and foremost, let’s start with one of the book’s most glaring issues: the writing was genuinelybad. It’s as plain and simple as that. This whole thing dragged like crazy and I was just so bored most of the time. Not only that, the writing was also painfully shallow. Nothing and no one had depth: all of the characters were completely one-dimensional and the plot failed to be interesting or engaging in any way.Speaking of the characters, let’s go on with my complaints by talking about our failure of a main character. I don’t know what happened to Violet between this one and the previous book, but I don’t recognize her whatsoever. She used to be the perfect balance of kind and bad-ass with a clever and sharp mind to boot! But now this girl we all knew and loved disappeared completely and instead we got this whiny, insecure idiot without a single rational thought going on inside that annoying brain of hers. I suddenly couldn’t stand her anymore!Same goes for Xaden: he suffered from major character assassination as well. He used to be strong, smart, mysterious, intriguing, and swoony as hell, but that was all gone now. Xaden turned into the most flat character ever, and he had no depth whatsoever. He truly felt like a robot to me, and I lost all interest in him. He is gone for most of the book, and at first I really missed his presence, but after a while, I was just bored every time he came on page, because I knew he would be the same repetitive and annoying character he was during all his other scenes, so I kind of didn’t care anymore if he was gone or not.The fact that both Violet and Xaden turned into insufferable characters is probably a big reason as to why their romance was terrible in this book too. First of all, after the end of the first book Ineededto get some groveling from Xaden, but did we get that here? No. Not even for a second. Xaden wasn’t sorry, he wasn’t regretful, he wasn’t trying to earn back Violet’s trust. No. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t even fight for Violet to forgive him. He was just... waiting. Not lifting a single finger to get back the woman he supposedly loves. He was so cocky in knowing that Violet would crawl back to him anyway that he refused to do anything to speed up the process. He just waited. And I guess he was right, because our spine-less heroine did indeed take him back without getting anything in return: no promises, no trust. Just nothing.Which obviously leads to a very unhealthy relationship between them where they don’t trust each other and in which they refuse to communicate. EVER. All they do is be horny and have sex, but they never actually talk anymore. They don’t confide in each other and neither do they let themselves fully open up to the other. Their entire relationship was just shallow, boring and irritating. I no longer liked anything about it. And then we even got some goddamn other woman drama, and my patience just vanished! I hated it.Now, when it comes to the side characters I don’t even know where to begin, because I feel like none of them were written well or with any depth to them. It’s like the author could never seem to focus on more than a few characters at the same time, so whenever she wanted to pay attention to one side character, all the other side characters just fell away. For example: at the beginning of this book we have quite a lot of focus on Imogen, and I was really seeing some amazing progress between her and Violet. I thought I saw the start of a beautiful friendship forming between them. But then, the moment Rhiannon started coming back into the fold (after being ignored in the first part), Imogen completely fell away again and her relationship with Violet never picked up. It’s like the author couldn’t handle Violet having more than one close female friend; she couldn’t focus on both at the same time. And therefore, neither Imogen or Rhiannon ever truly felt like friends to Violet because they were often suddenly ignored in her inner monologue or in the story. They were more like decoration, like tools to further the story along. Thus, none of Violet’s friends ever feel like real characters on their own..I loved the dragons in the first book; they were my favourite part of the entire book. But now, I couldn’t care less. Tairn used to be this sassy, grumpy dad-type, but now he was just a flat, monotone character with no real personality. Everything he said was repetitive, and his entire character just seemed way too simple and lacking any sort of depth. When it came to Andarna, I genuinely think her entire character was butchered. She used to be this cute and precious little baby, and now she turned into someone annoying, bitchy and arrogant without any meaningful connection to Violet. She was like an entitled teenager, and there’s a reason why nobody likes those.Of course, there were also other characters of whom I was really looking forward to seeing their story develop, but I didn’t get anything remotely satisfying when it came to them. Liam’s sister was only in a few scenes and in most of them she was just flat-out exasperating; everything about her character was anti-climactic.More importantly however, I feel like Dain just got completely ignored during this entire book. He used to be Violet’s best friend for such a long time and after it is revealed he didn’t even really do anything to betray her, Violet doesn’t remotely seem to care?? She doesn’t think about him and she doesn’t give him the time of day... she sort of forgives him but not really?? It was so weakly developed and I honestly expected more. It was, once again, very anti-climactic.Long story short, the only reason I somewhat enjoyed this book, and why I even finished it, is because I still felt a semblance of attachment to the story and these characters after book one, but even that wasn’t enough to keep me engaged for long enough. I couldn’t help but skim near the end of this book, because I was just so bored. I genuinely didn’t care anymore, and this book was just way too long for no reason. All in all, this was one big disappointment to me.'The Empyrean' series:1.Fourth Wing- 4.5 stars2. Iron Flame - 2.0 stars",2

I just want to read in peace.LET'S START WITH THE REVIEW""Trust me yet?""""With my life.""🫠🫠After having some time to recollect my thoughts, I do believe that in no way this was a perfect book. Yet it was so enjoyable and exciting. I loved it in all its imperfections. Xaden and Violet have my heart and the series seems to be getting darker and more powerful. But oh how I ate it all up 🤭Was it better than Fourth Wing?The plot certainly was better but I do think people will find its execution a bit messy in general.Is it binge worthy?Absolutely, you just need time.So A LOT happens in this one, in fact way more than the first book.This book is so action packed and relationship focused, I didn't think I could love this series more but I really do.The best part about this was Tairn and Andarna. No one can tell me otherwise. I came in to love Xaden and Violet but the dragons... AHHHH 😩😩❤The book picks up immediately after the events of Fourth Wing and with no time wasted we jump into the story. Iliked the addition of new charactersand the way they all had their own personalities yet never overpowering.Felixand his sarcastic arse was top notch. I liked how he kept things real. I do believe the transition ofSolane'sissues with Violet could have been smoothened a bit considering how strong she came to be. I absolutely LOATHEDVarrish.He's the equivalent of Umbridge I swear. Hated, hated, hated him. Those who have read Fourth Wing know, am not mentioning one of the characters, but I'll just say- his dynamic with Violet was chef's kiss 🤌""I want you exactly how you are, emotions and all. I want the woman I fell for...""🩶I lovedXadenand Violet.The groveling and reassurance THROUGHOUT the book was everything!!So we all know how things were left in Fourth Wing, and I expected Xaden to grovel his way for a few pages but our girl Violet made him grovel the whole time and I LOVED it. He was patient with her, he took his time with her. He made mistakes in this one too but he owned up to it and gave her answers.❤️‍🔥She had 100 questions? He answered them all. She asked the same question a million times? He answered it each and every damn time. Someone tried to make her jealous? He confidently claimed and assured her every time. Yeah, exactly! That's the kind of man he is 🤭😌⚡I adoredVioletin this. Let's be honest, there will be a lot of people who will find her annoying and insecure in this one. I personally did not. To me it made sense. Everyone lied to her throughout her whole life. Almost every new person wants to kill her. She lost someone very close to her. Her issues with Cat although wasn't really necessary but made sense. It gave Xaden and Violet the opportunity to become confident in each other and gave the opportunity to trust each other again. I loved Violet was patient and open towards Xaden, well eventually 🤭🐉Now let's get tomy babies- Tairn and Andarna.Y'all if you adored them in the last book? You will LOVE them in this. Tairn was his sarcastic self, caring self and always giving his Silver One wisdom. I absolutely LOVED Andarna. Her adolescent self was so snarky, it was adorable. I wanted to protect them both, and especially my baby Andarna. Her reveals(Yes, multiple reveals 👀)had me gasping. I can't wait to see what else is in store for them.🔥Theside characters- Ridoc, Sawyer, Imogen and Rhiwere such good friends. The way they supported Violet through thick and thin. They had each other's backs. Sawyer and Jesina? They'll be cute together if it happens 🤭 These four kept me laughing. They made the two main characters real and brought life to the book. B and Mira 🫡🤡Dain and Cat-Bro now idk what to think about them 😭😩 It feels weird. No they're not a couple or anything, just two idiotic characters....""I would have done the same thing you did because I'm just as reckless for you as you are for me.""The romance. The spice. The action. The plot twists. The drama. The reveals. The writing. PERFECT🤭🤭 I believe the torture scenes and the training bits were the best written parts as it showed how deep all of their bond was. Butthat one scene(can't spoil) had me bawling my eyes out, so heart touching and I just wanted to hold and hug him 😭😭😭❤ Those who have read it will know 😭The reveals at theendtho OH MY GOSHHHH. Yes it's true I got spoiled for the ending but I didn't let it get to me. I was bummed but I ate it up because of how well Rebecca Yarros wrote it. The action was so good!! I couldn't put the book down at all. The cliffhanger tho 😭😭😭😭DAMN BRUTAL. DAMN. BRUTAL.Am gonna be obsessed with the next one too 😩😩 Can't wait for it.Be kind on the review. Or just move on, I won't tolerate any harassment on my reviews against my friends or me.~•~•~LET'S GOOOOO",5
298,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","I thought the first half of this book was close to unbearable and the second half was riveting.Why an editor didn't suggest shaving off a hundred or so pages of this book I do not know. It would be quite easy. Just get rid of the constant repetitive repetitious:“How am I supposed to really love you if I don’t know you?”and“He doesn’t trust me.” I shrug. “And I can’t really trust him. It’s complicated.”Because, god, it'sreally notthat complicated. The romantic will they/won't they mostly played out inFourth Wing(of course they will) so having to sit through loads of faux love angst about ""oh, Xaden, how can I know you? How can I trust you? Fuck, you have a hot ass"" was so boring. Not to mention the fact that Yarros' smutty talk is kinda cringe.I was so so close to skimming during the first half BUT I have to say I thought the book went on to redeem itself a lot in the second half.The politics and magic of this world are surprisingly quite interesting when they manage to rear their head in between Violet and Xaden's theatrics. Yarros developed side characters further and I really came to love the camaraderie between Violet, Rhi, Sawyer and Ridoc, as well as the developing relationships and tensions with new characters. I love the voices of the dragons. I enjoyed Varrish as a villain (one of the few things I did enjoy about the first half.)When we reached the battles at the climax of the novel, I couldn't look away. The action scenes were suspenseful and dramatic and the ending, though a bit predictable, made me actually interested in reading the next book.I admit I was shocked to discover three more books are planned. Will they all be 600+ pages? Because I find it hard to believe this story has that much life left in it.",3

I'll come back to edit and write a proper review at a later time, just didn't want to leave it hanging with no thoughts or rating.Please take this with a grain of salt if you are a super fan of this series or of Rebecca Yarros in general.I don't like her writingat all-not even a little bit.The entire feel of the book is still juvenile af. Like all the YA trappings- except they fuck nonstop 🙄I felt that really diminished Violet's character becauseXaden wouldn't communicate with her for damn near the whole book, or be upfront and honest with her and she just keeps falling back into bed with him- like , I thought you were going to stand your ground bruh?Let me not forget to mention the'It'S aLl My FaUlT, eVeRyThInG iS mY fAuLt- AlL tHaT iS wRoNg In ThE wOrLd Is AlLlLlLlLlL mY fAuLt'- fr- stfu.The world building again isn't very fleshed out .Miscommunication, jealousy and insecurityGALORENo character development -I actually disliked them more in this book than in book 1. Like, they went backwards. Lemme be specific- the main characters, Violet and Xaden.The pacing is off-the beginning I felt didn't give enough, the middle was a slog, and everything but the kitchen sink is thrown at you so fast and hard at the end. Like wut?I can't wait for more ppl to finish to see how they felt- IknowI'm not a fan of this series but there has to be complaints from actual fans out there lol I mean come on.

308,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","""Remember it's only the body that's fragile. You are unbreakable.""Ahh, that was pretty awesome. I'm going to need a moment to process all this.Many moments later...Right, onto my thoughts.Allow me a second to gush here. I love it when a book knows what it's there to do, and that is to entertain the reader. It isn't there to be slow or boring or god forbid, pretentious (shudders). Rather, its goal is to squeeze every ounce of joy and delight out of the pages, and that's what this series does best.Cracking open the first page, I was sucked right back into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. It's as if I've never left it. Everything I loved from the first book is here—nonstop action, characters I could root for, snarky dragons, and sizzling romance. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.The only thing I didn't love was our main couple having squabbles for half the book over reasons I couldn't make heads or tails of. I get that Rebecca Yarros has to inject some sort of strife between them to keep things interesting, but I was just confused. But if it's that or hundreds of pages of lovey-dovey mush, I guess I'll take confounding couple problems any day.I always have a sliver of trepidation going into book 2 of a series. What if my enjoyment of the first book was a fluke, a figment of my imagination? Or that the author somehow found the magical formula once, but can't reproduce it again? Or worse, that there's no interesting story left to tell? But I needn't worry becauseIron Flamecontains all the magic of its predecessor.I will say though, going in, the length at more than 600 pages was a bit daunting. But once I started, it didn't even matter. I was riveted throughout. It felt like every single page served a purpose—except for the aforementioned confounding couple problems—building momentum and eventually hurtling towards a stunning conclusion. Honestly, if there were another 600 pages, I'd happily gobble those up too.Before this book, I admit I was a bit puzzled that there could be five books in this series, like how much more is there to this story? But seeing the way Yarros has built out the universe and the war in this book, and especially that ending, I get now how there could be so much more to this. And I'm glad. I'm not sure I'm ready to say goodbye to Navarre any time soon, so I'm happy there are still a few more books to come. I just hope the wait isn't too long.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.Fourth Wing~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧",4
309,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","If I could erase one series from the world, it would be this one. Nothing original, badly written with bland characters and romance. The way she has written the main girl, like she needs to be violent under the threat of violence(her nickname, btw), has written Murica all over it. People are dying on the page, but she is horny which is something thatRebecca does in her books.Also, I'm positive this is an industry plant series, so I'm interested if this book is going to get booted in rating like the first one.

313,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","3 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️Overall,Iron Flamewas okay.Parts I've enjoyed and parts I found myself skimming through the pages. It was littered with fillers.My favorite parts were mostly the action scenes and the dragon scenes.I wasn't a big fan of the development of the romance in this one, there were tender and hot moments but that still didn't make up for how the relationship seemed to go in circles rather than grow. Maybe that's because Xaden's development was.....meh? Not that Violet's development was any better.I absolutely loved the tension between Violet and Xaden in Fourth Wing, but once the relationship passes that phase it's tricky for authors to keep it interesting and it certainly fell short in this sequel.I don't know if I'm the only one who feels this way but this book was heavy in dialogue and information dump and that's why it felt like it was dragging..The drama between some of the characters had me roll my eyes because most of it was so unnecessary we could be doing other far more interesting things than this.I'll just highlight a few spoilers below to get some points across so beware..............[Iron Flame Spoilers Ahead].............First of all, the jealous ex trope should be on every author's list of banned tropes. It always results in unnecessary drama and tension between the couple that I do not need especially when they have far more important issues they need to resolve between them. Imighttolerate it if they weren't an established couple, but if they are then that's a big no no for me.I wanted to throw my kindle at the wall. It's just frustrating to read about.And speaking of Violet and Xaden's relationship, dancing around the whole ""trust"" issue while still hiding things from each other simply because the other didn't bother to ""ask"" was annoying and did not add anything to their relationship but to create unnecessary tension. Did Xaden actuallyworkfor earning back Violet's trust or was he just waiting around for whenever the time was convenient? And Violet's judgement and choices were often clouded by her longing and lust for Xaden.Still I found some of their scenes tender and sexy but it definitely is less appealing to me than it was in Fourth Wing. Their relationship has less substance now.Because of how lukewarm my emotions were throughout most of the book, the ending did not gut me as much.These thoughts reflect my own experience while reading this book.",3

315,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","1.)Fourth Wing★★★★★I am so torn on giving this a three or four star rating. this book was for sure too long, and for sure had way too many parts that i had to push myself through, but the end of this book felt five stars to me, so here we are. I actually think the pacing was the weakest and strongest parts of this second installment, because again some chapters were so pointless and tedious, but then the book would hit such a fast paced stride that I didn’t want to put it down and had to know what was going to happen next.like i said in my review offourth wing, there is nothing ground breaking within this fantasy romance (i mean, i guess so a little with it seeming like goodreads made a brand new category for her), but it is a fun read and a fun world to be in. the banter is a little cringe at times. the twists and turns are a little wild and back to back to back at the end of part one and part two, but i also couldn’t stop turning the pages with speed. and overall, there was just way more things i enjoyed than disliked.i loved that we got to see the other quadrants of this school and them working with the dragon riders sometimes. i loved… all the additional “friends” we met in this one (yes, even that one. maybe extra that one lol). i really extra loved all the family dynamics within these pages (even though i was very emotional throughout). and i loved seeing more signets and learning more about them (and all the foreshadowing of what is to come with them). the dragons are the best part of this story, so i loved every single scene with them. but the best part of these reading experiences is buddy reading with so many of my friends and theorycrafting about everything. truly overall i had a really good time with this one and it was a fun read with an absolutely wild ending.trigger + content warnings from the author:""Iron Flame is a nonstop-thrilling adventure fantasy set in the brutal and competitive world of a military college for dragon riders, which includes elements regarding war, psychological and physical torture, imprisonment, intense violence, brutal injuries, perilous situations, blood, dismemberment, burning, murder, death, animal death, graphic language, loss of family, grief, and sexual activities that are shown on the page.""additional trigger + content warnings i wrote down while reading(the last two could be potential spoilers so please use caution): drugging, ptsd depiction, nightmares, medical attention refusal, alcohol consumption, self harm to get blood for magic, mention of parental abandonment in past, suicide/self sacrificeblog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon",4

Check out this blog review:[Iron Flame: An Honest Book Review]My thoughts? Well, this wasn't terrible, but I was slightly disappointed. It didn't have the same sparkle as the first book did for me.When I first started the book, I was seriously convinced that this book was better than the first. I was excited and was plowing through. Then the 25oish mark hit and I was losing interest.This book felt long. Not only there was small print in this book, but there seem to be chapters in this book that could have been edited down or not included altogether.The relationship between Violet and Xiaden wasn't the same. Yes, there was a little bit of pining in the beginning but it didn't last long. Also this time, it seems like there was a competition on having the smut scenes in the craziest places.The magic system in this book left me asking lots of questions because a lot of it is unexplained as to why certain magic works as it does. Maybe I am forgetting some of the details from the previous book. But I spent a few times just wondering why things happened as they did.I really love the dragons in this. It is really what kept me going in reading this. They have amazing personalities that shine individually. Also, the side characters were amazing. Can I say Rhiannon is my favorite in this? Such a supportive friend, Violet doesn't deserve her.The ending, the surprise ending that everyone was talking about. Was, okay? I mean, I didn't see it coming but the book didn't put in a hyphened suspense to care about the ending. The book took so long to get there that I was just ready for the big reveal to be over with.Connect With Me:BLOG⟫INSTAGRAM⟫PODCAST⟫TIKTOK ⟫",3
317,"Iron Flame (The Empyrean, #2)","""My house. My chair. My woman.""Spice:🌶️🌶️⚠️Trigger Warning: TortureI don't know why I thought I would survive this. I am a pathetic, weeping heap on the floor and nothing can get me back up again. I wish I could say that book 3 would help, but it will probably push me over the edge instead. That ending, in particular, is like a hard punch in the face. Yet, contrary to popular opinion, I loved the ending as much as I loved the rest of the book. I think it promises an even better story in the next book. Not to mention, there are some specific scenes that I've found so satisfying, that they make me grin even through my tears. Besides, those plot twists are amazing! My jaw is permanently on the floor.Moreover, I had no doubts that Violet would be her usual awesome, genius self. The shit she has to deal with in this book is unbelievable. The kind of shit that not everyone would be able to handle or survive. She may have a lot on her plate that makes her insecure about herself. Nonetheless, she is determined to do the best she can and protect her loved ones in the process. It may not be anything new character-wise, most female main characters have these attributes, but this is what I love about my characters. She should work on her lying, though. 😂Furthermore, nothing Xaden does could ever make me mad. He is the perfect man in every way and I will fight anyone who thinks otherwise. Sure, he lied to Violet and he still keeps things from her, but it's out of necessity and he APOLOGIZED. Besides, he has to deal with his own bad shit, and his responsibilities are endless on top of dealing with his very pissed-off girlfriend. I love a guy who looks like a coldhearted villain but is actually just a big softy who murders sometimes. Besides, it's a bummer that he isn't as present in the beginning, even though it's a significant part of the plot and should make me feel like shit.Additionally, I adore Violet and Xaden's relationship even more so than before. In the first book, they have to get over the prejudices and past between them. However, in this one, they have to figure out how to be together. Love isn't enough and it shouldn't be. It is only the motivation they need to make things work. They may be in love but that doesn't mean they trust each other as much as they should be. Saying ""I love you"" doesn't solve everything. They need communication as well. I appreciated this aspect of their relationship. Nevertheless, I wasn't thrilled about the spiteful ex trope (is it even called that?) that appeared suddenly, even though it's resolved pretty nicely and it has little effect on Violet and Xaden's relationship.Lastly, everyone on Vi's squad is precious. They are adorable people, true friends, and I would lay my life down for every single one of them. Sawyer and Ridoc, in particular, are my favorites. They are the perfect blend of goofy and badass and that alone is enough to make me love them above all others. Not to mention, Tairn and Andarna are an absolute treat. Tairn is the grumpy dad who's sick of everyone's bullshit, especially Vi and Xaden's arguing. Whereas, Andarna is the scary teenager who just started puberty, picks a fight with everyone, and has just discovered sass. As for Sgaeyl, she's giving couldn't-bother-anymore mom vibes. They are one of my favorite, delightfully dysfunctional families. On another note, I can't believe there is actually a character that I hate more than Dain. The level of hatred I feel for this person is concerning. In fact, they are so horrible, they make Dain look like an innocent baby.",5

I sure hope it was tears of laughter (or pain) because y'all need to explain.🛑SPOILERS🛑So I got a real important question here.....how is it that main characters always read about the most pressing issues so damn slow? Like are you actually about to tell me this woman,this author, read one chapter of the manuscript per a ....day? She took WEEKS to read 19 bloody chapters. I would binge that shit in an hour. Hell, I bet even Jeremy read it in 3 seconds. But she took her sweet time like the annoying little vermin she is.Immediately I want to express just how much the heroine ruined this whole book for me. Reading from her POV was like taking a knife, exposing every nerve in my body, and pouring vinegar all over them. To be truthful I don't even remember her name. Every time it was spelt out, I read it, then instantly like my brain knows self-preservation, it erases the letters as if I never saw them. Loren? Mulan? Rowan? No clue.She kept thirsting for Jeremy, shoving her nose in Verity's business, and gatekeeping everything she learned from the hero. I mean I guess his wife did try to kill her children about a million times out of a sick obsession......but that doesn't concern you love, put down the manuscript🙂It drove me CRAZY every time Lemon finished a chapter and had to put her two cents in.Oh but she's so evil😢, oh but she's so callous🙄, she's just so horrible😩. like shut the fuck up already, you nosy, home-wrecking ass bitch. I hope you never get a good night's sleep again for what you did to my psychotic icon.I find it fitting that the villain and a character that in a sense was meant to be unlikable was my favourite the whole time.Verity really did the most while doing nothing at all.That includes:💅Pretending to be in a vegetative state for months on end💅Opening her eyes ONLY when Leren was watching💅Running around the house like Casper the ghost💅Messing with the TV to scare the shit out of Loren💅Traumatising her son even more than he already was by talking to himSafe to say Lupon was crying, shaking, throwing up from fear < and I mean likeliterally, she did do all three of those at one point or another💀.Whereas usually I'd be shivering in me timbers right along with the heroine, the horror aspect of this book followed by Wulun's dramatic reactions were too fucking funny, it distracted me.I put my hand on the mattress to lift myself up off the floor, but immediately shift backward onto my palms when I catch Verity watching me. Her head is in a different position, turned to the right, her eyes on mine.How I imagined Verity every time she'd unexpectedly turn her creepy head on the heroine😭😭 Alright I do apologise for that one but come on.... You can tell Verity, that silly goose, was having the time of her life and so was I.my blood runs cold when my eyes are pulled to the figure standing at the top of the stairs. She’s just standing there, watching her husband as his mouth roams over my breast.My entire body stiffens beneath Jeremy.Verity’s fists clench at her sides before she rushes back in the direction of her room.Whoever thinks that letter was real, explain this comedy (which is actually much funnier with context I promise). I washalffully hoping Verity would chase her petrified ass around the house to really seal it in, the traumatisation and future years of therapy that is.So many missed opportunities😔I bet every time she rose from her ""coma"" and gave Lavan another premature heart attack, she giggled like a maniac before carrying on with her bullshit. Really for that reason alone (making Lowyn age 10 years every time she took a breath), Verity will remain my fav.I actually cannot believe Jeremy fell in love with an old, smelly sock of a character that is Lavash after being married to his genius wife. Talk about a downgrade. ONCE AGAIN DID SHE MURDER CHILDREN?? Yes, but at least she wasn't creepy. I know many might disagree but I found Louwon way more hair raising. I mean the sleepwalking?? Straight outta a horror movie.He fell asleep while I was in the bathroom, attempting to abort his daughters with a wire hanger.And look.... Verity is pro choice😌💅You must understand that although the suspense was okay and plot twists, even if below average, were at least emotion-inducing.... the romance was the blandest, stalest, dullest, dryest, most flavourless, and uninspiring piece of crap I've ever read. EVER.In fact, I even scrounged up some fan castings for you guys. I had such a clear picture of them in my head, I just had to share<3🥵Jeremy:🥺LumanTheir sex scenes were also about as hot as you'd expect two pieces of wood humping each other would be.Anywho the ending? We're not gonna talk about it. And not even because I was mad or shocked, I simply didn't care. Verity carried this book and she was kinda brain dead for 99.9% of it, nothing will change that power.EDIT 08.2022:8 months later and I've decided we're gonna talk about the ending. Here's a hot take. If I HAD to pick a team, I'm gonna choose the letter. As we've already established, The FMC was a sleepwalking red flag and MMC wasn't any better. Personally being impressed with the author's ability to manipulate her readers is one of my favourite feelings, so Jeremy and the Lochness monster turning out to be the real villains would be a phenomenal plot twist...WOULD BEif this book was written better, with smart (but not obvious) foreshadowing. Unfortunately it wasn't, so the manuscript being legitimate is a more satisfying thought meanwhile the letter a more infuriating one.all in all:I know it seems like I really hated this book but if you squint a little YOU WILL SEE that I did mention some positive highlights. Like this being a comedy. A+ miss Hoover. Or how Verity was the determined, obsessive psycho of my dreams. And I did actually get sad during one scene (When Jeremy pulled his daughter out of the river).Yuh that's about it.EDIT 10.2022:I've read the bonus chapter and I liked it because they are all suffering😍",2
321,Verity,"NOTE: This review is based on my personal opinions about this book. Please note, this is in no way an attack to the author. I am not an advocate of hate trains, lets not send hate to anyone.Full Review: Maybe I should stop reading Colleen Hoover, maybe its not these books and it's me. Anyhow, I am thinking the reason I keep coming back is because, her plots are very interesting and the execution always falls flat.OK...where do I even begin with this mess?The story was captivating, probably the best plot I've seen in Colleen Hoover books so far. Everything else sucked. The characters were shallow and convoluted, I tried my best to relate to Lowen, but I disliked her just as much as I dislike Colleen Hoover's other main characters. They all have similar personalities and nothing to offer. Maybe because they sound so righteous but are wrong is many places. All the characters she writes are cookie cutter adult contemporary heroines, wrapped in tragedies and trying to get through life. There is no distinct 'voice' in Hoover's characters and it's a shame because with the plots she sets, the characterization can do better. You know how some things only feel good in theory? But in practicality, they make no sense? That's how CH writes.Speaking of characters, Jeremy was nothing special either. He didn't play much of a role in the book, at least not actively. He was there to serve Verity's storyline and being the love interest. And that's that. He has a personality of a dry leaf and why both Verity and Lowen were obsessed with him...is a question for another day. Jeremy is not enigmatic, he is not mysterious, he is not anything and that's one of my biggest problems in the book. He is just so badly written, when there could have been soooo much Hoover could have done with his character. Why should I care about him?The fact that both main characters thought it was OK to cheat when Jeremy's wife was camatose in the SAME house made things worse. And they constantly try to justify this. Now I know that it was intended and everything but the fact that they showed little to no remorse was enough to make me hate both of them. The book itself does not acknowledge their cheating, there is no retribution, no consequence of their actions - everything is brushed off without thought. When a book has problematic aspects, it's perfectly okay. When these aspects are romanticized and their flaws are not pointed out (as it should be), then we have a problem. With Lowen and Jeremy not acknowledging the fact they cheated, it just sends a wrong message.Verity is supposed to be a psychotic and obsessive wife to Jeremy who had hated her children even before they were born. Again, sounds better in theory. The plotline should give you chills but ends up being cartoonish and cringey. Jeremy being a cement wall with no personality, her obsession made little sense. Still, she is a better 'character' than the other two. CH tried to write a dark character, but honestly with the wattpad-esque writing, there was no impact.I am glad that the author tried something different, and her writing has changed since her first books but that wasn't enough to cover up the bigger holes here. I have already talked about the characters, which were my biggest issue, specially because I prefer good characterisation over good plot. Here are a list of other reasons why Verity sucks.1. It's not an erotica so why were there pages upon pages of repetitive sex scenes? In fact Verity and Jeremy's entire story was just that. It annoyed me because they clouded the story the whole time. The book was 10% story and 90% sex scenes. The publisher should market it as an erotica if that's the case??? Why is this a problem for me? Missed opportunity. Using sex as a tool to fill Verity and Jeremy's storyline is lazy writing, when those scenes could have been used to give Jeremy more personality and explore other aspects of their relationships.2. CH might be a bestseller, but she is TERRIBLE at writing tragedy and trauma. Both are needlessly used as characters back stories and important part of their personalities but treated dismissively. The MC mom died of cancer a month ago and while it's talked about in first two chapters or so, it's forgotten quickly and Lowen in too horny to remember her. The man who died in front of her? No follow up on that trauma, nothing at all. It just served as a way for her to meet Jeremy. Hoover takes these heavy plot points to add drama, but she never treats them well enough. You do not need to shove one traumatic event in vain to add substance. A well-rounded protagonist can be formed without relying on trauma at all. If the purpose was for us to sympathize with Lowen and make her edgy, then obviously this too failed. I am not a fan of authors using trauma porn, where excessively bad events are used to riddle backstories or even current stories. This is also an obvious pattern in CH other books. MC with tragic past, an asshole love interest with equally tragic circumstances = sexy times.Jeremy's daughters died and his wife is in a coma, but his character often showed little to no sadness while there were a lot of paragraphs describing how crushed he was. Guess he too was so horny that it was OK to cheat on his wife. Oh and the solution? Transfer her to a nursing home so he could hook up with Lowen as much as he wants? Bad execution, bad writing, bad everything.The end where he realizes truth about Verity and kind of kills her? It's treated as nothing. No consequence at all? He just goes on to make a lie about the incident and live a life with Lowen...like what the fuck? Where is the PTSD? Where is the follow up trauma or messed up mental health when you become a murderer of your murderous wife?3. THAT ENDING....THAT DAMN ENDING. I said this is in my other reviews as well but the thing I dislike the MOST about the author is her endings. She'sbadat writing them. There was a huge lead up on Verity being NOT comatose and there was the whole creepy thing going on with her but in the end. No psychotic behavior at all? She just opens her eyes and admit she was lying and that's it??? Then she dies??????? Like what was the point in a psychotic character if she was gonna do that??? It all felt so flat??ALSO the letter at the end that makes us doubt if Verity was actually a victim and Jeremy was the villain?? Like no that's not an amazing twist or anything, that's CH trying too hard. This kind of plot twist is overdone, it's a cliche you will find in horror movies or thrillers from early 2000s. I expected better.In a nutshell, I have ISSUES with this book. It could have done better. But this is where Hoover and I part ways. I won't be reading her books anymore.",1
322,Verity,"Me, rollerblading into my therapist’s office with heart-shaped sunglasses and a piña colada and dropping this book on the desk with a loud thud:Boy do we have much to talk about today!Why readVeritywhen you can just pull out an Ouija board and summon a demon from hell? I'm sure it’ll have the same effect. I finished this book feeling completely sapped of life, as if I've been bleeding freely for the past few hours instead of simply reading. That ending. What the hell. If I could just shake my head to dissolve the memory of it, to disarrange it somehow, I would. Because of all the things I’d braced myself for,thatwas not it.Right. Let's talk plot.Lowen Ashleigh is set free from the long tedium of her daily life when she’s employed by Jeremy Crawford to ghostwrite the remaining books in a popular series his wife, Verity, is unable to finish due to an unfortunate accident. Lowe acquiesces in the spirit of hope: that this opportunity would help her acquire some small measure of celebrity and that celebrity would be oxygen to the fire of her career. But nothing prepares Lowe for Verity’s autobiography, which she accidentally stumbles upon one day. For the horror of it. Verity’s secrets paint a different picture of what Lowen thought she knew of Verity, Jeremy, and their lives together. But sooner or later, as these things often go, the whole truth will spill, and the fraught waiting in-between would come to an end, with havoc and screaming and loss.“After all, this is a house full of Chronics. The next tragedy is already long overdue.”I love books that make me backtrack my own declarations of preference. The books that catch me completely off-guard, astonish me, keep me on my toes.Verityis not at all what I expected, and I think it is all the better for it.I picked it up with a great deal of skepticism. I did not enjoy any of Hoover's previous work, and didn't think Verity would tip the scales. I’ve never been happier to be so wrong because this book absolutely lives up to the buzz.Verityis a huge departure from Hoover's catalogue. It's a fiendishly clever, mind-bending whirligig of a book. The plot is a hall of mirrors where everything is a vacant reflection, including the people who live there. Hoover draws you into a world where illusion informs reality, and time enfolds hauntingly. She lures and tricks and wrong-foots. Always, she wields her unreliable characters to stunning effect: confounding, disturbing and delighting in turn. Not only is nothing what it seems, it’s not even what it seems after it’s been revealed to be not what it seems. And I was entrapped in this story long before I even realized the net was already cast.The book's biggest triumph to me was the sheer energy threaded the pages, how it feels uncontrollable, yet it is perfectly under control by the author. I like the way Hoover makes you feel Lowe’s deep-skin unease and confusion as if it's your own. You can sense the danger pulsing all around, and while you can scarcely see the freshly hideous future taking shape ahead, you can feel it all the same. In short, if I were Lowe, I’d have gotten thehellout of there. I’d have been impressed by her courage if I weren’t too preoccupied repeating a litany of “GET OUT OF THERE, YOU IDIOT” in my head.And,oh my God, the ending. That shit struck me backhanded. I'm still reverberating from it. Because here's the thing:Verityoffers its reader no solidity of truth that they could hold in their hands. Even as I was reading and rereading the last chapter I was mining it for clues, trying to make sense of something that felt so utterly senseless. Everything I’ve read up until that point felt like a false memory and I was left shaking my fist at the whole book for leaving me on such a hideous note as it did. Because,what.So, yeah. I'm going to let this story haunt me for a long time.",5
323,Verity,"Writing: offensively bad/5 | Plot: nonexistent/5 | Ending: abysmal/5THE PLOTLowen is a struggling writer who gets the opportunity of a lifetime to co-write a series with acclaimed author, Verity Crawford. When she arrives at Verity's home to do some research, she comes across a disturbing autobiography revealing the truth about all the tragic events in her life. Should Lowen let Verity's ""dreamy"" husband, Jeremy, know wassup? Or just sex him instead? Find out!MY OPINIONNOW LET'S BUCKLE TF IN BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT TO BE A ROUGH RIDE (not the sexual kind Verity LOVED).I want to keep this ""short"", but I'm not sure I have it in me. This book tops Stay Awake and Unmissing by a MILE. I picked this up even though romance isn't my thing because I literally cannot log onto Goodreads without seeing a Colleen Hoover book. So I had to find out for myself, and I certainly did, and as they say... curiosity killed the cat.OK. SO LET'S GET INTO IT.- Lowen was unnecessary. Literally this whole story could be told without her POV. You could've just had the diary entries as a POV, with Jeremy struggling in real life, and then BAM that ""twist"" at the end. Not only was she unnecessary, but she was ANNOYING. BIG pick me energy. So you thought Amos choking you was rock bottom but you sexing a comatose woman's husband in her marital bed was chill? Ight. And honestly her whole sleepwalking story to create empathy in the reader was garbagio.- The writing was appallingly bad. This was BEYOND closed caption ass writing. Even a blind person didn't need this much detail. Did we need to know that Verity's writing software of choice is Microsoft word? No. Did we need to know that Lowen picked up her drink, took it to the stove, filled her bowl was spaghetti, reheated it in the microwave, then went to the fridge to grab a glass of water before sitting down at the dining room table? NO. But yet we do.- The gratuitous sex was literally like being in a 14 yo boy's wet dream. DISGUSTING. I literally skipped PAGES and PAGES of sex. What in the 50 shades of gross is this? How did it add to the story? If you're horny, there's p0rn. PLZ. We don't need this in a ""thriller."" ALSO. The whole ""oh I was just exaggerating for the sake of it"" doesn't hold up WHEN YOUR OTHER CHARACTERS ARE LITERALLY SEXING IN THE EXACT WAY YOU DEPICTED IT IN THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY SO???????- Jeremy had the personality of a wet cardboard box. Legit how did ANYONE fall in love with the man when he said/did nothing of substance. This is what they call dickmatized. Free my ladies.- Also, also... this book did no favours for writers tbh. Saying shit like ""I write suspense novels, of course I know about your girlfriend"" doesn't make any sense???? I'm not like WOW HER BRAIN, I'm like... wow.... is her brain ok? What is the correlation?I'M ABOUT TO WRITE SOME SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK- Plot holes? Nah, plot CRATERS. How did she fake the brain scans? Why didn't Jeremy just kill her when she came home from the hospital? (maybe I missed something?) Girl is up at night sneaking around opening bank accounts but can't reach out to a friend and be like HALP??? And don't use this whole autobiography as the reason, because your publisher could corroborate your story and you're telling me you never discussed it with her afterward????- The letter at the end was atrocious. A perfect example of when authors try to hand-hold the reader through the twist to make sure it lands. I didn't need a perfect play-by-play of what your pretending ass was up to in a letter. I gleaned it from you just saying ""SIKE I WAS FAKING.""- Lowen ""forgiving"" or ""justifying"" Jeremy's double murder attempts was brutal. C'mon. Not during women's history month.PROS AND CONSPros: I finished thisCons: I read this___Check out my YouTube",1
324,Verity,"Bold. Unrelenting. All-consuming. Creepy. Unputdownable.What I’ve come to appreciate most aboutColleen Hoover’s work—whether it’s an emotionally charged love storyorin this case, her first go at suspense—is her penchant for pushing boundaries. For telling theunexpectedstory.“It’s got bad things in it. Bad words, bad people, bad scenes.”Hoover preemptedVerity’s release with a warning of sorts—although facetious and comical in delivery, it’s something sensitive readers should take to heart. This storyline isdark, and the lives of the characters that inhabit the pages are far from perfect—so, don’t kid yourself into thinking this is something it’snot.Verityis horrifying, maddening, and what-the-hell-inducing, but it’s also sustenance for that bibliophile looking to satisfy a craving for somethingdifferent.From chapter one, it’s blatantly obviousthiscomes from an entirely different side of Hoover’s psyche than her typical love stories. Blood spatter accompanies the all-consuming, addictive quality of her words. Storytelling with the power to crawl inside of your mind, take over, and demand your undivided attention.Lowen’s life is literally in shambles—her mom just passed, she’s broke, on the brink of eviction and even though she’s a talented author, the crippling anxiety involved with marketing herself to fans has made her work less than popular.It’s the opportunity of a lifetime that uproots Lowen from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan to the quiet Vermont countryside. Contracted by a publisher to ghostwrite the three remaining books in an uber-popular series after the author was involved in an accident, Lowen has a ton of work ahead. Research lands her in Verity Crawford’s home office, looking for anything that might indicate the direction the author wanted to take the series. Instead, she finds herself caught-up in Verity’s life. Living in her home, sleeping in her bed, and spending time with Verity's husband, Jeremy, and their young son. Inescapable is the grief and pain marring it all.Most surprising was the level of creepiness Hoover managed to incite. A level even some seasoned suspense writers fail to attain. From someone who reads in the genre consistently and watches horror, it’s quite the feat for me to feel this level of anxiety. For my stomach to be twisted in knots, in anticipation of what’s to come—but, it happened.And that finale . . .stunning. I was so sure I’d pinpointed exactly what was happening andwhy, but I was wrong. So very wrong.Hoover mentions in herAcknowledgementsthat this was an indie project she wanted to branch out and write on her own, which is commendable and exciting when you think about where her inner drive might take readers next. While there’s no denying her love stories are fierce, my hope is formoresuspense. To be this taken with her first try, I can only imagine what that mind of hers might dream up next.",5
325,Verity,"""Find what you love and let it kill you.""-Charles BukowskiWoah, this wasfuuuucked up. It should really come with a warning:do not start reading this at night if you want to sleep.For two reasons, actually. One, it is so compulsively readable that it's almost impossible to put it down until you've finished it. And two, it is seriously creepy and disturbing. Warnings for depictions of child abuse and some graphic violence.Perhaps this doesn't need to be said, butVerityis definitely not a regular Colleen Hoover romance. There's a love story, and sex, but it is predominantly a creepy thriller. And a mindfuck, if we're being honest.Verityis mainly about three people - struggling author Lowen Ashleigh, a man called Jeremy Crawford, and Jeremy's wife, Verity, who was recently left incapacitated by a car accident. Verity is a successful writer, but she is no longer able to continue her bestselling series. That's why Lowen is brought in to complete the remaining three books. To do so, she stays at the couple's house so she can go through Verity's notes.But Lowen finds something else in Verity's office. An unfinished autobiography. As she reads, her fear grows. Lowen begins to dig into dark truths about the family and the deaths of their twin daughters. At the same time, she finds herself falling for Jeremy and wondering if perhaps she should reveal the truth to him.I don't want to say too much,but I thought it was excellent. Hoover expertly leads us on a winding trail of lies and manipulation. As the story is essentially Hoover - an author - writing about an author reading about another author, there's this constant sense that someone is lying to you-- but who is it? Now, that's not so easy to tell.I was good at spewing bullshit. It’s why I became a writer.This may seem like a bit of a backhanded compliment, but I think I enjoy Hoover’s fucked-up books so much because I usually find her regular romances kinda fucked up.I like her books so much more when she's writing about trauma and morally-questionable charactersthan when she's trying to sell me a douche as a love interest.It's a clever book, and I don't simply mean because of its twists and turns. It's clever because of the fear and uncertainty the author creates. That all three authors create. The aptly-namedVerityis a novel about fictions and truths, about authors and characters, and about how it can sometimes be hard to separate the two.I found it absolutely riveting.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube",4
326,Verity,"Ok, this one has me scratching my head. I chose to read this piece of nonsense based on the myriad 5-star reviews on Amazon—I’m talking HUNDREDS. Now there are two reasons this novel may have so much positive feedback. First, it could be that there are hundreds of readers who don’t often step beyond this author’s normal genre (of which this book did not belong) and are simply ride-or-die fans. Second, it could be that I’ve gone round the twist and am missing the value. I’m betting on the former.The writing here is, admittedly, pretty amazing. Character development and plot movement, as well as the establishment of tone, is all done masterfully. What is ludicrous, however, is the plot itself.**SPOILER ALERT AHEAD** Verity is a well-known and well liked author with a huge fan base. She and her husband lose their young twin girls some months apart in separate tragedies, then Verity herself is in a car accident. The accident leaves her in a semi-vegetative state, unable to move or communicate. Her husband seeks to hire an author to finish the last three books his wife had promised as part of a series of nine. In steps Lowen, a talented author in her own right, though certainly not as famous as Verity. She travels to the couple’s home, where Verity is under constant care (fed, diapered, etc.), in order to look over the woman’s notes in preparation for the writing Lowen has been commissioned to complete. Whilst rummaging through Verity’s office, and falling in love with Verity’s husband, Lowen discovers a manuscript that is supposedly an autobiography written by Verity before her accident. It is beyond disturbing and paints the now comatose author as a raging psychopath who despised her twins, feeling only raging jealousy at the attention they garner from their father. So far so good, right? Here’s where it all goes to hell. VERITY IS FAKING HER INJURIES. Really? Doctors and nurses, specialists in their respective fields, can’t tell SHE IS FAKING IT?? For MONTHS? She has been cleaned, turned and fed and NO ONE KNEW? Additionally, we are to believe that she wrote the most disturbing things about herself and her children and labeled the manuscript an autobiography as a WRITING EXERCISE? What woman writes that she tried to abort her own children with a coat hanger as part of an exercise?? I could go on and on but I think you get the picture. Absurd is the only word that adequately conveys the entire premise.I wish someone, anyone, would have said to this author, “hey, you’re damn good, but this story just doesn’t make an iota of sense.” I’m left wishing back the hours it took me to read this insanely ridiculous drivel. Two stars for the obvious talent, but nless you are a die-hard fan of this writer, I’d skip this one altogether.",2
327,Verity,"How did Colleen Hoover ever think up this dark and twisted tale? It is so unique, so completely shocking that it blows away every other suspense story I've ever read.Lowen is a struggling writer when she gets an offer too good to pass up. Jeremy, the husband of successful author Verity Crawford, hires Lowen to complete Verity's series when his injured wife is unable to do so. Once Lowen arrives at their home to start compiling notes and do research, she discovers an unfinished manuscript that looks to be Verity's autobiography. What is written in those pages will horrify and haunt anyone who reads it.So many books advertise as suspenseful thrillers, but hardly any of them cause my heart to blip even a little. (I know, I'm a stone cold reader.) But this book! There is such a deliciously creepy atmosphere that permeates throughout and it got me good. I'll admit to heart palpitations, cold clammy hands, and being startled at the smallest noises. And as the story progresses and we find out more and more, the tension ratchets up to almost unbearable levels.There was never any hope for me. I was hooked from the very first page. There is a creativity to this story that makes it hard to look away. I've never read anything like this, not even close. As a result, every page was a surprise and I just wanted to keep going. And as the truth gets darker and more tortuous, I had no choice but to hold on for the ride of my life.This book employs one of my favorite formats, a story within a story. I've loved pretty much every book I've come across that uses this format, and it works especially well here. The interspersing of the inner manuscript with the outer story allows us to find out what's going on at the same time that Lowen is figuring things out.I cannot believe this is Colleen Hoover's first thriller. Reading this feels like watching a master at their craft, setting the bar higher than I ever thought possible. This story is so astonishing and unsettling and completely original. It will stay with me for a long time.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Ends with Us/It Starts with UsReminders of HimRegretting YouUgly LoveLayla~~~~~~~~~~~~",5
328,Verity,"I've pulled up this review and tried to make the words come for a couple of days now, but every time I try to write the words all that comes to mind isWTF Colleen?! Obviously we were warned going in that this one would but much different than her other novels, but she didn't tell us that it would be so compulsive and I wouldn't be able to live my life while reading it.How dare she??But seriously, this book was so delicious in a seriously twisted way, and I feel slightly guilty admitting that I lovedVerityso much due to its dark and disturbing nature.""Find what you love and let it kill you."" -Charles BukowskiThere's not really much you can say about the plot here, other thanread it for yourself ya filthy animalyou really should just go into it blind. Obviously there are numerous content warnings,child abuse, murder, murder of a child, attempted home abortion, adultery, descriptive fatal pedestrian accident, etc., but it you're open to picking up this book with as little knowledge of the story as possible it will be in your best interest.""Most people come to New York to be discovered. The rest of us come here to hide.""The characters here are deviously flawed, every last one of them, and Ilovethis. I'm a sucker for storylines that feature the writing of a book inside the plot, and this was no exception. The varying between Low's present tense POV and the chapters featuring Verity's autobiography built the most exquisite tension, and by the end of the novel we are flipping pages as quickly as Low is, trying to decipher where this is going and what's going to happen. Also, that epilogue. That is all I will say, other than I'm respectful and grateful to CoHo for leaving this book without the neat wrapping and shiny bow. There are pieces of the story that are essentially left up to the reader to determine their thoughts on, and while a bloody and gruesome story, this will make a fabulous book club novel with copious discussion points. Highly recommended if you can stomach the content, but beware reader-once you pick it up, you certainly won't want to set it down until you turn the final page.",5
329,Verity,"Have you ever finished a book and thought… WTF did I just read?Verityis one of those books that will do that to you. Word to the wise for CoHo fans: this is not your typical book from Colleen Hoover. It’s amazingly written and it’s a completely captivating read, but it’s so different from anything she’s ever put out before.“Some families are lucky enough to never experience a single tragedy. But then there are those families that seem to have tragedies waiting on the back burner. What can go wrong, goes wrong. And then gets worse.”Verityis a complex story about an author who is ghost writing a series for Verity Crawford, an author who is injured in a way she can’t write right now- maybe ever. Her husband, Jeremy, commissions Lowen to do this work. Lowen goes to the Crawford’s house to do some research but that house and that family is more than she ever expected. While searching through old paperwork pertaining to the series Verity has written, she finds a manuscript of a truly messed up autobiography that changes her life and the life of the Crawford family forever.The word I would use to describe this book isdisturbing. I was seriously disturbed the whole time I read. It wasn’t too spooky for me, but it was thrilling and horrifying at times. The writing was out of this world and the story messed with my mind. I’m not sure if I loved it, hated it, liked the characters or hated them. It’s a story that’s not always likable, but dang it was good. It was enthralling and made me think. That ending messed with my mind so bad, I don’t even know how to feel.If you’re a fan of psychological thrillers with romance thrown in and don’t mind a book that’s disturbing and thrilling because it’s also brilliant, check outVerity. I’m glad I went outside the box with this one and read it!!",4
330,Verity,"** UNPOPULAR OPINIONThis is the second novel that I've read by the author.  I'm not really familiar with her writing or style, but I was seeing many 4-5 star ratings on this book and it was a ""thriller"" so that was enough to push me to give it a try.There are many, many high reviews for the book so I'm not here to dissuade anyone from reading it. It just wasn't a good fit for me. I read hundreds of thriller/mysteries and love the genre.I've read darker novels and enjoyed them, but this one gave me an uncomfortable feeling that it is hard to express. Was it because it involved the characters children? Maybe. Was it the graphic sex scenes? May have contributed  Was it the improbable plot? I don't usually have an issue with this if I'm entertained. I wasn't. I can't explain more without giving spoilers.Again, this novel didn't work for me. If you decide to read it, you may enjoy it like so many others. Just my opinion. I wish I could unread it.",2
331,Verity,"oh my fucking god. i finished this book at 4am thinking “what the fuck did this author do to me?!?”this shit was brilliant. idek how to comprehend this. like was everyone a victim or a villain?!? am i team manuscripts or letters?!? i don’t fucking know. tbh only Crew can set us free, he knows the truth.i don’t get disturbed easily but this shook me to the core. i could feel it in my bones. i don’t even know how to function and move on with my life. i’m a changed woman.you’ll be catching me blankly staring at walls lost in thought over this book",5

The darker and more twisted the better.This one didn't resonate with me.Sorry.And watch out for triggers.cheating, death of a child",1
333,Verity,"Um no. This ain’t it chief.Also that ending??NO.I feel like the high ratings and amazing reviews for this book are mostly people who already love CoHo's books and this is their, 'dip of the toe' moment, for them in the 'thriller' genre lol.",2

341,Verity,"★ /5This was... stupid?I don‘t even know how to talk about this. I don‘t think this is actual mystery thriller, it is just a romance novel with a slightly different plot. Sadly, nothing about this book, particularly impressed me or intrigue me.Personally, I do not think that this book is worth the time.",1
342,Verity,"I will never look at Steak n’ Shake the same way……Colleen Hoover and Lisa of Troy finally meet. Alright that’s weird. I am never referring to myself in the third person again….So what’s the scoop on Verity?In Verity, we find Lowen Ashleigh who is a down-on-her-luck author when she gets an incredible offer to finish a series by a famous author, Verity Crawford. When Lowen goes through Verity’s office, she discovers an autobiography by Verity with salacious admissions and jaw-dropping tales. What will Lowen do with the information she has discovered?This is my very first Colleen Hoover work so I will share with you my general impressions, not sure if these are hallmarks of her other books. Hoover keeps the action flowing with short paragraphs and sentences. There are no page long paragraphs here.The storytelling is top notch with gossipy revelations sprinkled throughout the book. This book is filled with steam. Steam upon steam. Steamy steam. Descriptions of steamy steam. However, please be warned that this book is incredibly, incredibly dark with some graphic depictions of child abuse.In terms of structure, Verity really reminded me of the book, Home Before Dark by Riley Sager, because it would also switch back and forth between modern day and back to an old book. The main character, Lowen, does have internal ruminations, but the author masterfully navigated these sections and did not get lost in the weeds.Verity is page-turning and reading it is certainly not a chore.There are two things that kind of bothered me, but with me, storytelling is everything. And this book had it in spades.First, the ending did not surprise me at all. Without trying to spoil anything, the ending relies on a familiar trope that I saw coming very early in the book.Second, a part of the ending did not make sense. Again, I don’t want to spoil anything, but it has to do with a certain reaction to the manuscript.Personally, if I was the editor of this book, I would have rewritten the ending, but (sadly) Colleen Hoover has not been ringing my phone off the hook.Overall, Verity is a dark, page-turning tale, and I look forward to reading more from Colleen Hoover. Highly recommended for those who are fans of May Cobb. Or try May Cobb if you enjoy Colleen Hoover.Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",5
343,Verity,"It’s currently 5:00 am, and I readVerityin one sitting. Dear god this book is FUCKED UP, and I love it. I'm obsessed with twisted, disturbing, dark stuff that messes with my brain. It feels like a mix betweenThe Silent PatientandGone Girl. I physically could not put this book down. Definitely my favorite Colleen Hoover book I've read. This had everything I love: smut, sadness, and mind-bending plot twists. This book felt like a rollercoaster, and I implore you all to read it. Such a thrilling read.",5

346,Verity,"🎉FIVE MIND BLOWING STARS!🎉This one is a killer! So dark and disturbing. I was not expecting to love this one so much. Colleen Hoover writes romance books. This one is a thriller. I have seen authors go from romance to romantic suspense, but never have I seen an author go from Romance to a dark and disturbing crazy thriller. She knocked this one out of the ball park.This one just blew my mind. I could not put this book down. I read it while fixing dinner and eating my dinner. I have never done this before. There are so many jaw dropping moments.All of the characters were done so well. I could just vision them in my head. I love her writing style. This was one intense read. Let me tell you this author writes so well. OMG!OMG! OMG! The ending was just perfect. I loved that twist. Wow!I am not a romance fan but loved this thriller so much that I went to the library and did the unexpected. I got her book, Without Merit. Hoover just changed me into picking up a romance novel. That's how good her writing is.This book just tied with my favorite book for the year so far. When this writer writes another thriller, I will be snatching this one off the shelves right away. I strongly recommend this book to all thriller fans that love a disturbing and dark thriller.I know! I know! I just get to overly excited when I love a book.I recommend this one to all thriller fans!!",5
347,Verity,"GUESS WHAT? I never have to say “maybe this weekend I’ll finally read a Colleen Hoover novel” again, because I finally did it. And I won’t be doing it again. Not for me really, but I see why people love this. I’m glad I did read it though because, well, this entire story is an absolute trainwreck and I do love watching a good trainwreck unfold. I mean, it’s entirely overblown to the point of absurdity and all the two main characters are more concerned with sex than the moral implications of…well, literally anything INCLUDING their sexual relations with each other, but damn does this go some places. It is entirely creepy, but also darkly funny once you know the twist because like…WHAT THE FUCK? This is successfully dark and bleak, and one you can't stop reading, I'll give it that. But like, imagining this from Verity's point of view...did she intend this as dark humor? Because wut? Also do people find this sexy? Because I have questions....is it like a Mr Rochester thing? Because this book does seem constructed around Jane Eyre nods in many ways.If you don't know the plot: Lowen, a struggling writer, is hired by Jeremy to finish his wife Verity's body of work after an accident leaves her unable to finish. Lowen finds an autobiography that reveals all sorts of juicy drama and murders, but decides to just have sex with Jeremy instead of do much about it until she can find a way to ensure Verity's story will get him to run away with her instead. Ill-advised, Lowen, ill-advised. Bonus points if you just pretend this is someone finishing Sue Grafton's alphabet series. Would have preferred that, honestly.Here's a handy guide I made:Its unfortunate that without the narrator in the book it probably would have been a more tense storyline. Lowen is really here just for the sake of sex scenes, and there are many. You know how Murakami can’t let a breast go undescribed? Hoover does that but for cum shots. Of which there are many. But one does not enter a novel like this (gross, why would I put it that way in this context?) for the sake of good writing but for a thrilling plot. Which, I will admit, this has. Albeit poorly constructed—I mean EGREGIOUSLY bad choices are made and nobody seems all that concerned with actually doing anything useful—but it will keep you flipping pages. Mostly to see if hopefully they all fucking die instead of just keep fucking, but whatever. You do you, Lowen and Jeremy. Wouldn’t recommend it, but we’re all grown adults.Seriously though ,so much of this book makes zero fucking sense. Like, I LOVE suspension of disbelief. But COME ON. How’d homegirl fake the brain scans?Also, Lowan is just like wow I have the answers to all sorts of wild shit but I’m only going to read a few sentences of it a day then make a trite comment and get to pantsless time with Verity’s husband. What is the time frame of this book? You are stuck in a house with possible murderers and you’re like NAH I won’t read their tell-all too quickly? But she can’t because apparently she’s gotta keep banging Jeremy, who is also technically her employer but there is no HR so fuck it, fuck. With Verity possibly watching? Christ. Also, wear a condom. Please, I beg you. What part of this tangled and weird situation made anyone think ""hmmm maybe a pregnancy would help?""Everyone is WAY too cool with murder in this too. Verity is a Medea-figure here, one who uses sex as a means of control and ranks how she values Jeremy based on the quantity of sex they are having, so I guess its no surprise she’s down to murder and not give two shits. But then there is also the ending. I wanted to like it. I mean, okay this whole book plays with ideas of duality—the twins as two sides of Verity’s personality, the two possible truths at the end—but Hoover is WAY too eager to walk you through showing to point out how clever it is. She’s practically yelling “VERITY MEANS TRUTH! GET IT?!?!?!?”So yea, this is fun enough I guess? I see the appeal. It’ll make a great movie when it inevitably happens. It could really only be improved upon, like, maybe actors will put some personality into these lifeless characters. The biggest plot hole in this is that two different people were in love with Jeremy, he’s as unlikable and bland as possible. Imagine Lowen having sex with a loaf of stale bread that is as down to kill as it is down to bang. You can now say you’ve read Verity.This is a book for the sake of fun and entertainment and gotta say, I was entertained. I hate everyone, I mean, these characters make Sally Rooney characters seem like wonderful people. To be fair, half the point of this book is to read some steamy sexy times, which there are many, but it sort of becomes annoying when the plot is so engaging. They break for sex again and it’s like NO, STOP, THERE ARE MORE PRESSING ISSUES, I NEED ANSWERS. Children are dead and everyone’s just like hey I’m horny. I get it, we all like sex but damn people. These people would all die in a horror film because the monster would be after them and they’d be like “fancy a quickie?” “Sure, J-bear, why not —— oh no my face is being eaten by this monster!” And Jeremy would be like “HOT.” And try to seduce the monster I guess? I don’t know.Anyways now I can say I wasn’t lying when I told people every day of my life in a bookstore or library for the past year that, sure, I’ll give Hoover a try. Mission accomplished.3/5because, in all fairness, it mostly accomplished what it set out to do.UpdateSo I read the bonus chapter and I’m not sure who read this and thought “say more!” but apparently enough people did to get a hardcover edition out of it. Yep, still hate everyone in it, probably more now.Low is basically haunted by Verity and some of it comes across as pretty uncool. Oh and it is no surprise Jeremy sucks more than we knew but certainly suspected. Also Low is still way too okay with Jeremy doing some murder, and like, did she think he’d just be a well-adjusted dude post-murder and not ever be dangerous again? Lol.Honestly, this is all a bit much and sort of ruins the sort-of ambiguity you could be convinced of in the last book.",3
348,Daisy Jones & The Six,"Yes! The series adaptation on Prime Video just released and it’s so far freaking good, especially the songs ! And here’s my review for this legendary novel of TJR!Daisy Jones and the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid is a captivating and emotional story that explores the rise and fall of a fictional 1970s rock band named The Six, as told through the eyes of their lead singer, Daisy Jones.The novel is written in an unconventional format, presented as a transcript of interviews with the band members, their friends, and family, as well as other individuals who were involved in the band's journey. This format is not only unique but also adds a sense of realism to the story, making the reader feel as though they are reading a true account of a band's rise to fame.The characters in Daisy and the Six are incredibly well-developed, with each member of the band having their own distinct personality and backstory. Daisy, in particular, is a compelling character, with her raw talent and rebellious spirit causing both admiration and friction among her bandmates.The novel's portrayal of the music industry in the 1970s is also fascinating, with the reader getting a glimpse into the excess and indulgence that came with fame during that era. The book's exploration of the band's creative process is also intriguing, as it delves into the complexities of writing and performing music.One of the strengths of Daisy and the Six is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in the reader. The highs and lows of the band's journey are felt keenly, and the relationships between the characters are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.What makes Daisy and the Six such a compelling read is the way that Taylor Jenkins Reid captures the spirit of the 1970s music scene. The story is set against a backdrop of social and cultural change, and the author weaves these themes seamlessly into the narrative.The book is a love letter to rock and roll, and Jenkins Reid's passion for music shines through in every chapter. She expertly captures the excitement and energy of live performances, and the way that music can bring people together.But beyond the music, Daisy and the Six is also a deeply human story about love, loss, and the bonds that connect us. The relationships between the band members are complex and multifaceted, and the novel delves into the various conflicts and tensions that arise as a result.What's more, the book is also a commentary on the nature of fame and the toll that it can take on those who achieve it. The Six are catapulted to stardom almost overnight, and the pressure to maintain their success takes a heavy toll on the band members' personal lives.In conclusion, Daisy and the Six is a beautifully written and emotionally resonant novel that will stay with readers long after they finish it. It's a must-read for anyone who loves music, drama, and unforgettable characters, and it's a testament to the enduring power of rock and roll.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
349,Daisy Jones & The Six,"Daisy Jones & the Sixis a masterpiece. Incredible. Intoxicating. Unforgettable. Truly one of the most remarkable stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The moment I finished, I had to immediately start from the beginning again. I refused to let go. And yes, I did read it twice in a row.CW: substance abuse/addiction, abortionSet in the mid sixties – late seventies,Daisy Jones & The Sixtransports readers to the most iconic age of rock n’ roll. The atmosphere and story composition create and authentic tale that I almost refuse to believe isn’t real! Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master of fiction – her characters possess an uncanny ability to charm readers and settle into their hearts. Her novels are multi-faceted and unlike any other books I’ve read, especially due to the oral history storytelling ofDaisy Jones. (Side note – the audiobook? SPECTACULAR. If you have access to the audio version, you will not want to miss this experience) Full of timeless quotes, glamourous scandals, and heart-breaking loss,Daisy Jones & The Sixhas absolutely climbed to the top as one of my favorite books of all time.FUCK! THIS BOOK IS SO FEMINIST! The women in this book are all so powerful and dynamic. There are so many strong messages about women empowerment, taking no one’s shit, supporting other women, and demanding credit where it’s due. Even the smaller side characters are them much more layered than most supporting characters, as we explore their own storylines. Plus the relationships between all of the women, (Karen & Daisy, Karen & Camila, Camila & Daisy – even Daisy and little Julia made my heart swell!) are wholesome, unique, and authentic. Especially for a story with a bit of a love triangle, I could not be happier with the superb study of the experience of women.I also was left so touched by the exploration of addiction. It’s a disease very close to my heart and I’m so, so pleased with how Taylor Jenkins Reid captured the dark, devastating nature of it. The story of both Billy and Daisy’s respective addictions bring light to the glamorization of drugs of this time, while not glamorizing it themselves. This book exposes the truth about substance abuse while simultaneously carrying an air of hope and recovery for those who may be in a similar situation. I’ll stand by this novel my grave as one of the greatest fictional stories of addiction ever told.And oh gosh, THE MUSIC! I just have to give a shout out to the author for writing so many superb original songs with their own distinct voice and sound. I cannot WAIT for the series to come out so I can finally hear these marvelous lyrics sung the way they should be. Again, I REFUSE to believe this isn’t a real band.I have so few complaints about this book, and honestly, they are so minuscule compared to the novel’s countless strengths. I felt the main plot twist wasn’t all that shocking and the ending could have been stronger compared to the rock-solid build up, but I’m so enchanted by this book that I’m totally unbothered.In sum, readDaisy Jones & The Six. Prepare to have your mind rocked by the story of a band that wanted to change the world, so they did.",5
350,Daisy Jones & The Six,"I know many people loved this book, and it's not as if I don't see why, but this choice of narration just really didn't work for me. I found Reid'sThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoabsolutely riveting from the very first chapter, but I thought the decision to write this book entirely in interview transcripts made it reallyboring and emotionless.Daisy Jones & The Sixis essentially a band documentary transcript. I'm sure most of you have seen a band documentary before. Former band members, their managers, and their friends are all interviewed, and the screen switches between them speaking and images/footage of the band in their prime. This is like that, but without the images to accompany it. Members of The Six, their acquaintances, and Daisy herself, recount the history of the band's rise and fall.I just… nothing interested me. I didn’t care when they were bickering about how song lyrics should go. Or when they were talking about the sex and drugs lifestyle. They just fly around, play gigs, do drugs, all while Daisy is being a brat and Billy is cheating on his wife. They are the only two characters of interest and they both irritated me.Perhaps it is because this is a perfect example of what they say a writer shouldn't do:all tell, no show. I mean, that's the nature of having it be an interview transcript. The characters just talk about their experiences, and it all felt very cold and detached. I wasn't immersed in the story; I wasn't experiencing it.I actually kept reading because the book seemed like maybe it was building to something good. It all feels like its leading up to a shocking climax at their last concert, but even the mystery surrounding that was unsatisfying for me. I was expecting something more juicy and exciting.Oh well. I do think it had a bit of a cool 1970s LA music scene vibe going on. The whirlwind of sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and all that. But it wasn't enough for me. I think the story would have been far more compelling written in the author's usual style. She seems quite good at writing about strong feisty women who get caught up in a vicious industry, but that didn't come across as well here.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube",2
351,Daisy Jones & The Six,"As someone who is a big fan of oral histories of pop culture things, and as someone who gives a rousing “sign me the hell up” toTaylor Jenkins Reid writing about historical Hollywoodin any way: This book is a dream.When I am not reading books, I spend a lot of my time reading in-depth articles. Sometimes these are on subjects I have little to no outside interest in: rich people bickering over preschool traditions, incels getting plastic surgery, whether Taylor Swift’s Fourth of July parties were a mainstay relic of her obsession (and fleeting brush) with the Kennedy family. (All of these are articles I read in the past week.) Alternatively, sometimes these articles are on things I care very much about, like certain comedy podcasts or cult-classic ’90s movies.This book is like a combination of both of those, but written by Taylor Jenkins Reid, and also it is 368 pages long.You have no idea of the joy its existence brings me.And that’s even before I knew it contained sentences like THIS ONE:“I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else's muse.I am not a muse.I am the somebody.End of fucking story.”I mean honestly, you guys, come on. What am I supposed to do with that other than love and cherish it and read it in a sitting?I hope I wasn’t supposed to do anything else. Because all I did was those things.Well, this book wasn’t perfect. Sure, maybe the oral history format is a little more used to being a lengthy Vulture article than a full-length historical novel, and yes, you could argue that those growing pains are evident more than a handful of times, but it more than makes up for it with the DRAMA.Oh, man, you guys, the DRAMA. Another reason I read a lot of random articles is that I love gossip, but I don’t love it so much when it’s people I know, because then I have to do annoying things like “empathize” and “feel bad” and it ruins my fun. But when I get my drama fromcelebrities- and, even better, FICTIONAL celebrities - no guilt necessary.It’s just so much fun.That’s my bottom line!(lowered to a 3.5 upon reread)-----------------reread updatesthe old ""reread a book before the adaptation comes out so you feel like the best bookworm in the world"" trick------------------pre-reviewReese Witherspoon: ""I devoured Daisy Jones & The Six in a day, falling head over heels for it.""me: hmm...crazy that i AM reese witherspoon...that we are one and the same...(this book was really good and i would like for the music in it to be real now, thank you please.)review to come",4
352,Daisy Jones & The Six,"Have you ever felt like there were two versions of a book out there? There's the version everyone you know reads. The one with the raving reviews. The one that everyone loved. Then there is the version you read. The one that is underwhelming and dry and was nothing at all like what you expected it to be. Have you ever felt that? Because I feel that sometimes.This is one such time.Seriously though, did I read the same book as everyone else?I was hoping beyond all hope that this would be my first 5-star book of 2019. Yeah, that's right, it's officially April, the FOURTH MONTH OF THE YEAR, and I have yet to read a book that blows me away.And with all the hype around this one, I was really hoping this would be it.It was not!So, maybe I'm heartless. Maybe I'm just uncool and don't understand what the cool kids are into these days. Maybe this book has some deeper meaning that my immature mind just could not comprehend. Maybe I just suck. Maybe this book secretly sucks too.Maybe it just wasn't for me.It was probably that last one.But also maybe not.First of all, these characters. I disliked them all.And I know that they aren't supposed to be likable. They are actually all supposed to be total a**holes. I get that. But even horrible people need to be likable, or at least interesting for the book to work. I personally didn't care for any of them.Daisy was a total brat. She was mean and spoiled and I just wanted someone to slap some sense into her.She was also the most special of all the snowflakes. It was always mentioned how she was just naturally better than everyone else, how everything came easy to her, and how she was just so absolutely amazing.Billy was also a jerk, although he was written to be a bit sympathetic. He's a crappy husband and a terrible friend and just overall controlling and kind of annoying.All the other characters feel only half-developed and kind of irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.Overall, I didn't like this. Obviously.I thought I would love it. I didn't. Many of you would like it, I think. It's obvious by the hype that a lot of you do.The book is told through interviews and is very character-oriented, meaning that there is basically no actual objective to the plot. That said, I didn't like the characters so this book was not a good match for me.I hope you like it if you do read it though! Maybe you will have better luck with it!TW: excessive drug use and addictions, alcoholism, abortion, divorce, toxic marriages",2
353,Daisy Jones & The Six,"Daisy Jones & The Sixchronicles the rise to superstardom of the fictional band that came to define rock 'n' roll in the late 1907s, as well as the troubles that subsequently led to the band splitting up seemingly overnight and its members never playing together again.Going in, I was a little bit wary that I wouldn't connect with this story. I wasn't alive during the 1970s and rock 'n' roll isn't my preferred music genre, so I don't have much in common with the book's settings. But this is Taylor Jenkins Reid, so of course I was hooked right from the start.Told via interview transcripts of band members and various friends and family, it reads like an intimate first person account. I know some readers felt this interview format made the book feel a bit impersonal, but it had the opposite effect for me. When you can see into so many characters, it automatically makes all them feel real and fleshed out, with their individual personalities, quirks, and baggage.The story is raw and evocative, filled with sweet, complicated characters I can't help but connect with. There's complexity and nuance in the way Reid captures the relationships between the band members, each flawed in their own way. With their every success, I cheered for them. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to see what happens next.For me, the only small letdown was the ending. To be fair, I can't quite separate out if my disappointment is just that I wish the band had stayed together forever, making music and being happy, instead of splitting up. I wanted certain things to happen with the story, but they obviously didn't, and that left me with an unfinished feeling.Taylor Jenkins Reid is the sort of author who can write about anything, even a topic that I have no interest in or knowledge of, and still make it riveting and poignant. Even though this is an account of a fictional group, I found myself wishing they were real so that I could bask some more in the magic of this band.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Seven Husbands of Evelyn HugoCarrie Soto Is BackMalibu Rising~~~~~~~~~~~~This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

354,Daisy Jones & The Six,"The 1970's was anamazing decadefor music. The Rock genre took the world by storm, selling out arenas and gathering heretofore unheard of crowds of obsessed fans.Groups such asThe Who, Led Zeppelin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, AC/DC,andQueenwere living large with lifestyles infused with sex, drugs and rock and roll.This novel is a fictional profile of one such band,Daisy Jones & the Six.Told via a highly creative interview format,Daisy Jones & The Sixis an exceptional example of that format done wisely. This felt like an episode ofVH1's Behind the Musicon steroids!We follow the band from its inception, through the process, ups-and-downs and the dynamics between the various members of the group.I have to admit that Daisy was a frustrating character for me. I found her to be selfish and frequently wished I could shake some sense into her.My favorite character by far was Karen. I really connected with her and could read an entire novel with her as the main focus.I started my read of this switching back and forth between my hard copy and the audiobook.Roughly 35% in, it was clear that the audiobook is absolutely the best way to inhale this story.I highly recommend that experience.The full cast truly draws you in. I felt like these people were real.I was left wanting to hear their songs, buy their album and hang their posters on my wall. Billy had me fangirling like I was in Junior High School again.This was my first Taylor Jenkins Reid and I was definitely impressed. She writes with such skill. I cannot wait to pick up some of her other books.Obviously,Evelyn Hugowill be next. I just hope the hype for that holds up as well as this one did!",5

TJR is taking this genre of faux-biographies/interviews and really making it a thing; but more specifically, her thing. between this and‘the seven husbands of evelyn hugo,’there is proof that fiction will forever be more appealing than nonfiction. no real life event could be told like the way TJR tells her stories. i am just in awe of her capabilities as an author.‘daisy jones & the six’is so unique, so edgy, so sexy, so daring, so raw. its everything i could want and hope for from a story about a rock ’n roll band. and if i had such an amazing experience reading this, i cant even imagine what listening to the audiobook will be like (i kind of wish i had done that first, just because of how the story is presented as a compilation of commentary from interviews) - its gonna blow my tiny little mind! i honestly cant wait!↠5 stars",5
356,Daisy Jones & The Six,"Taylor Jenkins Reid's strength lies in her ability to write realistic characters and relationships and take you through a whole life journey. This book has all the elements that we love about Evelyn Hugo: a unique storytelling format, a life story, a notorious historical setting, an iconic main character, a tumultuous and very human relationship, etc. It's the same formula, but switched with different variables, and therefore I think how much you resonate with those variables depends on personal taste and subjectivity. Evelyn Hugo matched what I liked, but Daisy Jones did not. I personally did not connect to this story or care for the characters, but I don't fault the author for that. I think I felt lukewarm for this book due to having spent most of my life mentally blocking out family & friends who deal with addiction and tumultuous relationships as a survival tactic, and therefore I am unable to connect to the subject matter as deeply. I commend Taylor's skill at writing realistically imperfect relationships, even though it was a miss for me and my own preferences.",3
357,Daisy Jones & The Six,"3.8 ⭐️i enjoyed most of this but i highly believe it was the best in the very beginning and at the very end. i read this with the audio book and honestly only recommend reading it with the audio book.it’s a whole ensemble of narrators that really hit the nail on the head with each character. i’m convinced i only enjoyed it because i had the audiobook along side me. for the way it’s written and the format it uses, it works.the actual story was simply just ok. i wasn’t wowed away like i usually am with other TJR books. this one is definitely at the bottom but i don’t regret reading it. i was happy with the ending and was satisfied.i enjoyed most of the characters, tbh i only cared about Graham and Karen for most of it and then Daisy and Billy towards the end. i respect and admire the way addiction is written in this book. reading daisy’s and billy’s struggle with addition and how it affected all those around them was much appreciated.can’t wait for the tv adaptation ☺️",3
358,Daisy Jones & The Six,"IS THIS AS GOOD AS THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO?That was my main question when I picked up this book. Sadly, no.There was a lot of potential but I felt like the story wasn't flesh out enough. I highly recommend listening to this one as an audiobook due to the format (interviews).Reminded me a bit ofA Star Is Born, but maybe less tragic and with a very confident main female character. The characters were definitely attaching but I felt like there should have been more. 300 pages of interview is quite short.Overall good, would recommend but not a favorite!",3
359,Daisy Jones & The Six,"Apparently I read a different book than everyone else. Or maybe my brain just thinks it's funny to make me hate hyped books idk.This didn't touch me whatsoever. I was bored and the story and some actions of the characters felt repetitive to the point that I skipped some paragraphs. Everything was so predictable and dialogues even felt pretentious sometimes. Trying to be meaningful while actually being pseudo deep (like 80% of tumblr u know?).Sure, this had some great quotes and some funny bits in it but.. that's about it.",2

361,Daisy Jones & The Six,I enjoyed this one quite a bit! I feel like if I were to have read it physically I wouldn't have liked it as much due to the choppy writing style and the constant switching of perspectives. I definitely understand why this one is getting adapted and I'm excited to see how they execute it. I think my favorite thing about Taylor Jenkins Reid's books is her ability to write characters that feel incredibly real.,4
362,Daisy Jones & The Six,"Update:it is with a heavy heart that I must announce not a single tear was shed. I felt nothing. I did not actively dislike this book, and there are things I actually liked about it. I just did not care about any of it.

369,Daisy Jones & The Six,"5/5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️“I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else's muse.I am not a muse.I am the somebody.End of fucking story. ”Oh fuck. I'm a mess. I'm such a hot mess. I feel like Daisy on crack. I'm a crying mess, I'm a screaming mess, I'm a heartbroken mess. How the fuck am I supposed to continue on with my life now after this book has happened? Could you people do it?I NEED A SEQUEL OR A MOVIE OR A SERIES OR SOMETHING!I'm literally on Youtube right now, trying to find a cover of these songs or anything. I'm so deep I'm gonna fall off. I'm supposed to watch the Oscars in a few hours, and here I am, crying over a fictional rock band.I have had such a weird history with this book from the get go. You can check out the date I started reading it,fucking March of 2019. You know it's February of 2020 now right? Yeah. I read a 100 pages of this book on March of 2019, in book format and then my book hiatus started. It wasn't because of this book, it just happens to me from time to time. I remember I actually bought it right after I started hearing all the buzz about it, and after having loved her previous work I knew I was gonna love this.But I couldn't have known it would change something in me.And then we come to today. I'm back from my book hiatus, ready to read some good things because it comes back again. And after I read 2 books this year, I saw that I had left this one behind. So, to make things easier for myself, I decided to listen to the audiobook. Which was so praised by everyone when it came out. I have never listened to an audiobook, I can't find myself concentrating to it. Maybe it's because I'm bilingual, or that my mind can't linger on to something for a very long period of time, idk.But I knew this particular audiobook would enhance my experience. Therefore, I started a 30-trial on audible, downloaded it and started listening while also reading it.It's one of those books were you check if the band was real, if the people actually existed and you're so convinced it's true. You just know they do because this book feels like it. I feel like calling these people and hear their stories and struggles and worries. I feel like I want to meet them and talk to them. I feel like I want to be them, despite their flaws. That's how perfectly constructed most of these characters are.I don't know how this author does it with each of her books. How can she make up actual people who feel so like...actual people?So raw, and flawed and complex. Worlds were black and white doesn't exist... but grey does. Like the real world. This woman is a true talent and I will read everything she writes, I swear. I'm just so captivated.I love rock, I love metal, I love pop. I just love music and rock bands and old music and sometimes new and I just knew I would be drawn to the subject matter of this book. But I never thought it would much more than a rock band book. That it would feel so personal sometimes. That I would sympathize with those people that have nothing in common with me.But the God, named Taylor Jenkins Reid fucking DID THAT!Overall, read this motherfucking book. Or at best... listen to the audiobook while reading it, speed 2.0. I flew through it in 5 hours, I didn't even drink water. Trust me, don't even pick up this book without listening to the audiobook. K bye!",5
370,Daisy Jones & The Six,"(Review from original 3/5/19 read-through):I listened to the audiobook and I gotta say, Taylor Jenkins Reid has knocked it out of the park again. I LOVED THIS SO MUCH. This audiobook was one of the best audiobooks I've ever listened to and I am SO GLAD that I decided to take in the story that way. It was narrated by a full cast and I just about died when my girl Judy Greer started speaking in my ear as the voice of Karen Karen. Seriously y'all, so fucking good. I WILL SAY, the reason I'm giving this a 4 and not a 5 is because the book as a whole ends a little unspectacularly. There's so much build up and tension throughout the course of the book and the ending just did not live up to what came before it. I do still HIGHLY recommend you check it out though, and 100% recommend the audiobook. What a wild ride.TW: copious drug use, alcoholism, addiction, abortion",4
371,Daisy Jones & The Six,Really enjoyed this! The audio book was fabulous.,4
372,Daisy Jones & The Six,"Great audiobook but not as good as The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo....Daisy Jones & The Six is a historical fiction book which follows the band, The Six, and Daisy, as they find each other, their spectacular rise, and the end.This is my third Taylor Jenkins Reid book, and I would rank them as follows: 1. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo 2. Daisy Jones & The Six 3. Malibu Rising. The audiobook was phenomenal, an incredible performance with an entire cast of characters. Whoever played Daisy had such an incredible voice, raspy, that it was just very unique and captivating. Additionally, it gave the depth and time that it needed. If I read [sigh], I read it super fast and move on, but it feels different when you actually hear a character perform it. The audiobook was definitely five stars.Why didn't I rate this book 5 stars? There were a few too many characters. Even now, I am not too sure what value Warren, Eddie, and Pete brought to the story. I also found that this book dragged a bit especially after reading the true life story of David Grohl in The Storyteller. Some hard truth time: I thought Daisy Jones & The Six was real or at least based on a real life band. This is not entirely my fault though. The author put in an author's note that says, ""This book is an attempt to piece together a clear portrait of how the renowned 1970's rock band Daisy Jones & The Six rose to fame."" Well, liar liar pants on FIRE! Because this is a fictional story. I felt like a sucker for thinking that I could rely on the Author's Note at the beginning of the book.Overall, an interesting read in an interesting format. This is one of the rare instances where I think that the audiobook is better than the printed format.2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones’s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",4

375,Daisy Jones & The Six,"I have read my way through 315 books to bring you myTop 10 Books of the Year (video).Now you know that this one made the cut, check outmy video reviewto see the others!I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else's muse.I am not a muse.I am the somebody.End of fucking story.Daisy Jones & The Six were the hottest thing in the late seventies - and just when they were on thecusp of true famethey broke up.It scared me that the only thing between this moment of calm and the biggest tragedy of my life was me choosing not to do it.Daisy Jones is the It girl of the seventies - her voice, her charisma and her beauty -it's the full package.Everywhere she goes, heads are turning and people are taking note.The Six are the band led by Billy Dunne - and they are good in their own right but they just need that extra push to greatness.So then a producer realizes...why not put the two together?And that's truly when something worthy of legends develops.But just when everything is coming together - when their album,Aurora, is ready to come out...the band breaks up.Shocking millions.It’s like some of us are chasing after our nightmares the way other people chase dreams.Even now, in modern times, Daisy Jones & The Six are still the best band that never was. The one that got away.And so, someone decides to write a novel about it - through interviews and memories - the public is able to watch the rise (and fall) of Daisy Jones and The Six.Oh, my, gosh.This one.It was amazing.This is the kind of book where you just have to set it down for a while and really revel in a story well-told.How am I supposed to live my life knowing this band never existed???It was SO immersivethat I literally spent 10 minutes googling songs from their ""album"" just to double check that this band didn't exist.This was told in a series of interviews and minor flashbacks. The way it was stitched together and the narrative that emerged was so incredible.The audiobook was...truly a notch above all others.Each character had a different voice actor/actress and they were all truly perfect. They felt so real.This one read like a miniseries and I'm keeping my fingers crossed.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads",5
376,Daisy Jones & The Six,"UPDATE….. EXCITING NEWS… 🎸🎤🥁ITS HERE….THE SERIES- on Amazon Prime VideoPaul and I watching the series. It started tonight!ITS SOOOOOO fricken GREAT!!!!!We’ve seen 3 episodes so far.Anyone else watching? (yet)It’s so wonderful to HEAR the music… awesome songs…. Terrific cast!!!!NEW UPDATED REVIEW.....I already expressed LOVING this novel: REALLY REALLY REALLY LOVING IT.....about a fictional rock band in the 1970’s - their rise through the ranks of the LA music scene - eventually becoming one of the most legendary bands in the world.Taylor Jenkins Reid is not a novice author. Her other five books:“The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo”,“One True Loves”,“Maybe in Another Life”,“After I Do”,“Forever, Interrupted”,Are ‘all’ genuinely - emotionally - passionate books that make readers *FEEL*.I’ve been thinking about “Daisy Jones and The Six” for days:.....the story, the creative structure, the characters as individuals and in relationship to one another: written superbly!!!As for ‘emotions’.....and ‘reflecting’....I’m still engaged — as this soulful novel is more than drugs, sex, and rock-n-roll......its a novel that speaks to our own losses and loves. This book broke my heart and mended it. The authenticity of these mult-dimensional characters have us relating to how similar & universal our inner voices are. It becomes totally clear yet so complex to understand how we can love somebody but not be happy with the way things are.This novel’s achievement is deeply moving - irresistible- and the real beauty is that it FEELS TOTALLY ALIVE....made with REAL VIBRANT ENERGY!There are written songs - that I can’t wait to ‘hear’. The mini series can’t come fast enough for me—-I’m a fiction-rock-band-book-groupie!!! Guilty pleasure- out of the closet!!!While reading this novel - there were parts where I wished I had bought tickets to the live show —I would have given anything to hear Daisy and Billie sing together. A couple of times they were soooo vulnerable- you could cut the air tension with a knife.Bottom line..... extraordinary......brilliant....heartbreaking...depth....and beauty.LAST..... some thoughts as to ‘why’ I think Taylor Jenkins Reid is popular...with ‘strong-loyal-fans’......( I admit to being one of them - having read every book she has written).....MOST: TJR makes us *FEEL*.....we often get a lump in our throat in her novels.....Stories always move smoothly.....Her characters are complex - broken & beautiful- powerful & fragile -.....Simple moments - mundane moments are so real - we relate......Storytelling is wise, witty, smart, devastating, inspiring, often consumed by passion and love.....Her stories have us thinking “what might we do?”......Taylor Jenkins Reid skillful writing transfers into real experiential tales....she can crawl inside our heads and have us laughing one minute - worried the next -.....when it comes to creating powerful - glamorous- female characters - TJR is the ‘go-to’ author.....at the same time she knows how to capture the quiet behind the scenes powerful woman equally as well......None of her books are the same - yet we trust we will be taken on an entertaining unpredictable journey.FIRST REVIEW immediately after reading.....Review coming in a day or two .. or three ...Going to get some sleep!“I feel the earth move under my feetI feel the sky tumbling downI feel my heart start to tremblingWhenever you’re around”Carol KingGREAT BOOK.... should make a terrific mini series!!!!At first...These characters felt SO REAL... I was SURE there must have been a real’ DAISY JONES.I went to look ‘Daisy Jones’ up on Google ... she didn’t exist!I was sad!But... Taylor Jenkins Reed created a novel that felt soooooooo darn real...It’s hard to believe it’s ‘not’ a biography.I LOVED IT!!! Loved it! Loved it! loved it!!!!!!",5
377,Daisy Jones & The Six,"Now, listen. I was not expecting this plot-twist of a rating for this book.At the minimum, it should’ve been a 4-star read because it’s Taylor Jenkins Reid.Because Evelyn Hugo.Because if there’s one thing TJR cannot be faulted on is creating stories so vivid that you will question your own reality.Do you know how many times I’ve wanted to search up Daisy Jones and the Six on Spotify so I could experience their music?So, because I know TJR can write such rich stories, this should’ve worked for me.But, my god, were these characters ghastly.I get it. You don’t have to tell me that that was the point. I get the fuckin’ point. But I was not sold on whatever was being sold.The disconnect between me and the characters and the story were too vast. It all felt too distant and I could not reach for it. I could not bring myself to sympathise with these characters, because I did not care for them, neither did I understand them.I mean, there’s only so much stupidity and recklessness I can overlook. I have no tolerance for it. Fictional or otherwise.Had there been more background to their circumstance, their human-ness, I could’ve overlooked it. Because the understanding would’ve been there. I don’t need to agree with your life choices and decisions. But I’d like to understand them at least.There was a lack of intimacy that was missing for me, considering it is quite character driven. The story that these characters were narrating felt impersonal. There was too much focus on the music and their drug and drinking habits that not much room was left for backstory and layers.Maybe it was the format of the book?There was a tonal shift towards the very end of the book, where certain revelations came to light and all of a sudden, things became very intimate and warm and I wish that had been the case from the beginning.And that Camila had more page time.In bloody conclusion, it’s not that the story was bad. The characters were though.The production of the audiobook was fantastic. The book? Not so much.———————————————Putting this down for now. My mood isn’t right for this book.———————————————I don’t think I could handle it if I didn’t like this.",2
378,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestSo in my pre-review of this book, where I lamented about not being able to find a copy anywhere because of all the HYPE (seriously, I could not find a copy of this anywhere and the library had, like, a five-hundred year wait-- thank GOD for my sister sending me a copy as payment for watching her kitten), I said that the people giving this author shit about her choice of title were dickheads. Some people got mad at me about that, but I stand by what I said. Even more so after reading this memoir. I am seriously side-eyeing the people defending the mother, actually, because based on the accounts in this memoir, she was verbally, emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive. Not only that, but she coached her daughter into an eating disorder at age eleven and then managed her to ensure that she continued to starve herself. That's not to mention the stage-parenting, the freak-outs (especially while driving), and the fact that she wiped Jennette when she went to the bathroom well into, like, her preteens (imagine not even trusting your eleven-year-old daughter to wipe her own ass) and showered her into her late teens (sometimes with her older brother and also while giving her breast and vaginal exams, ostensibly to search for cancer, I guess).What the FUCK.Here's a hard truth. Some people are shitty people. Some of those shitty people are shitty parents. Being a parent does not give you a free-pass from all wrongs. Especially if you're just doing the whole parenting thing for a little human-sized accessory that you can live all of your failed dreams through. By the end of this book, I was kind of glad Jennette's mother died, too. After living under that kind of suffocating parenting, with gaslighting and serious emotional trauma, not to mention abuse, I would be fucking done. I don't blame Jennette for her feelings. And I love my mother. I'm lucky enough to have a pretty good relationship with her. And a few years ago, my mother got breast cancer, just like the author's mom, and I was so devastated that I felt like I was working in a total fog. I stepped back from social media and it was all I could do to focus on my day job because I was so upset. But I know that other people's experiences aren't like that, and we don't get to dictate how other people mourn (or choose not to). My mother ended up okay, but I would have been really sad if the worst happened, and that's because she was a good mom and she still works hard at being a good person. People who don't try to be good people are owed nothing. Why enshrine the dead if they leave behind a legacy of trash? The title is shocking but only because we tend to airbrush the pasts of the departed.I'M GLAD MY MOM DIED rejects this premise. In this memoir, Jennette McCurdy lays out her upbringing in painfully explicit detail, starting from her mother's hoarding and growing up in poverty in a house that sounded like it should have been condemned, to the way her mother forced her into acting and she ended up being the golden goose that kept her family afloat after years of living hand to mouth. She talks about the way her mother emotionally manipulated her, and her guilt. She talks about how she started to get body dysmorphia because she felt like the only way she could continue to be successful was to look like a child forever, and when she expressed this fear to her mom, her mom taught her how to starve herself, starting an eating disorder that would basically rule her emotional breaks and her relationship with food for over a decade. She talks about her hatred of acting, what it was like working under the man she calls ""The Creator"" at Nickelodeon (we know who), her friendship with Miranda, and her jealousy and resentment of Ariana. And then she writes about her utterly conflicting feelings when her mother began to die of another bout of cancer, still manipulating her emotions.This book stressed me out so much. I think it would be very triggering for people with eating disorders and people with abusive parents, as it is SO descriptive when it comes to these passages. It's also a brand new look into celebrity, because most celebrity memoirs are written by people who are still in the business, but this is kind of a fuck-you memoir written by someone who doesn't care if their bridges are burned, so she really unhauls all the dirt in a way that someone who probably wanted to keep working in this field wouldn't. It's really well-written but the writing can, at times, feel a bit amateurish. McCurdy has a lot of raw talent but the people hyping her up as brilliant are exaggerating a little.ALSO, who the fuck is calling this book a ""hilarious"" memoir? Are these the same people who were talking about how ""funny"" CRYING IN H MART was? Is this where we open up the floor to a conversation about how women's emotional pain and fraught relationships are often mined for comedic value? Why do people find it so amusing when women hate their mothers? My review is already getting longer than I intended it to, but this is definitely a trend I've noticed lately where I'll pick up a memoir that's supposed to be funny and instead it's just an emotionally wrenching book about a woman dealing with her trauma. Ha-ha, I guess. Fuck that.Doread this book, if you are in a healthy mental space, but gird yourself against the hype. It is not Jesus's Second Coming. It is just a very brave story about a woman trying to come clean with herself and the past.4 stars",4
379,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"I'm Glad Her Mom Died Too""Why do we romanticize the dead...?Indeed. Why do we?Before this book came out, my knowledge of Jennette McCurdy only extended to random gifs featuring heriCarlycharacter, Sam Puckett. I didn't actually know who she was and what they were from, I just knew they were funny and fit my ""book review"" purposes.Here's an example:When this book dropped, however, I was drawn to the title, the gloriously vintage macabre book cover, and the fact that it was getting rave reviews.I was excited to read this and loved the cover so much that I purchased the hardcover drop instead of waiting for my library hold. I initially started this in early September, but for personal reasons I won't get into, I had to set it down for a bit. I have almost no triggers and can read pretty much anything without being all that affected, but - again - for personal reasons I won't get into, I found the details of Jennette's mother's behavior, narcissism, and emotional manipulation to be extremely triggering. And don't even get me started on the eating disorder triggers. I was also amidst a fairly stressful period in my work life, so I decided to wait until that was over before picking this back up.Fast forward a little over a month and my library audiobook hold was by then available, so I decided to jump back in with that format. Let me just say that I can't recommend the audiobook version of this highly enough. It is obviously read by Jennette McCurdy herself and I think she does a great job of it.I think the dichotomies of Jennette's life and story are very interesting and well explained. She is able to get across very nuanced and contradictory sentiments without sounding like a complete whiner. And that's a really hard thing to accomplish in practice.For example, she is able to outline how, despite understanding how privileged and ""lucky"" she was to be famous and on TV, she loathed acting, a lot of the fans, and the experiences that came with it all.^See how assholey that's sounds just me saying it? Well, she nails it in the book, I promise you.I also felt very connected to Jennette and had a lot of empathy for her. I grew up in LA County and am VERY familiar with almost every location she references in the LA/Orange County area. I literally drive by the Westminster Mall (which she references being that she grew up in Garden Grove, and which is basically a nonexistent ghost mall now) every day on the freeway on my way to work.Also, I know I said I didn't want to get too woo-woo personal, but I will just say this: I deeply connected to Jennette in terms of understanding the longstanding effects (as a child who doesn't know any better) of being made to feel like you are responsible for the state of mind and emotions of another person - an ADULT person. For years.It steals your childhood, stunts you emotionally, and really takes a long time to work through.Some people should just NOT have children, folks. It's just that simple. I mean, what they say really is true: a lot of people spend their adulthood just trying to get over their childhoods. And that's even true for ""GOOD"" parents.But I digress.I liked how self-aware Jennette is. Or, at least, how self-aware she appeared to be in this book. That said, I also feel like this memoir came a little soon in terms of Jennette's recovery. She's very, very new to being on ""the other side"" of things. Although perhaps this book is a part of that, and so I can't fault her for that. And who am I to judge or criticize.Overall, this book was a great account of a very unique human experience. I will definitely check out any future books or content Jennette puts out in the future. And I'm rooting for her, her recovery, and her happiness.",5
380,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"praying that Jennette makes more from this book than Nickelodeon could’ve ever offered with their hush moneyA truly incredible and hard-hitting memoir.Whether you watched Jennette’s shows growing up (like me) or you don’t know her at all, I think this book is a must read. I don’t want to go into too many details, so I’ll just share some of my thoughts:• The writing is easy to read but still poignant. I think Jennette did a great job recounting the events of her life. I especially appreciate how she recounted her childhood; she really nailed writing from the perspective of a naïve child who doesn’t realize how awful her mother is.• I love how truthful Jennette was about her own fuck-ups. She admitted she was very aware of how bitter and rude she had become, and how ungrateful she seemed (obviously, I think she was justified).• I particularly loved the section about Jennette’s time on“Sam & Cat”. It showed how much her addiction, mental illnesses and eating disorders affected her work; how much Nickelodeon mistreated her, especially when compared to Ariana Grande; and how resentful she had grown over the years.•The exploitation of children in the entertainment industry is something that really needs to be discussed.Seeing a child star expose the abuse she suffered in the industry is truly heartbreaking, but extremely important, especially in this day and age, where even more parents are pressuring their children and forcing them to put themselves out there for fame. I wonder if in 10 years we’ll see similar testimonies from kids of family channels who grew up making money for their parents in an even more disgusting way: by having they entire lives documented and posted online for all to see.• Jennette’s friendship with Miranda was so wholesome <3• A bit of a critique: I feel like certain events were skipped and only mentioned later in the timeline (for example: we never see her audition for iCarly, or how filming the 1st episode was, suddenly it was already 3 years into the filming of the show, out of nowhere we find out that she’d been to multiple events and red carpets, she randomly mentions she knows she has OCD and EDs – I guess she learned and came to terms with it off-page…). Obviously, this is a memoir, so the author knows better than me what was important to document, but still, some of these things seemed kind of crucial in my opinion (especially her learning about her disorders).• The main reasons I’m giving it 4 stars is because memoirs are not really my thing, so I ended up not enjoying this as much as the other books I give 5 stars to; and because, as I mentioned, I think some things could’ve been a bit better. But, again, I still loved this book and highly recommend it to everyone!(review written on 24/08/2022)---this title isBRUTAL💀i'm so happy for her 😌 can't wait to read it!!(06/04/2022)",4
381,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"this is a very candid account on the abuse jennette mccurdy suffered at the hands of her narcissistic mother, and how that merged with her experience as a child actress. i don’t think you need to be familiar with her show, or even know/care about her as a person to glean lots from this book, and i think it's an important text that could even be considered historical, due to her nature as a public figure and the way her story is likely representative of a much larger population of child actors.for those hoping to get a “tea sesh” about the abuse rampant at nickelodeon, you won’t be getting that here, despite it being what the major media outlets are currently fixating on. jennette doesn’t shy away from talking about her experience with sam & cat (she hated it) and her experience with dan schnieder (terrible person, obviously, whom she never refers to by name), and even dedicates a short chapter to ariana grande, but this novel isn’t centered around that in the slightest, and to come into this book only for that would be a disservice to jennette's story.reading about the abuse jennette experienced firsthand is completely heartbreaking. she writes about having an eating disorder, given to her by her mother, and feeling beholden to her mother at all times. from calling her ten times a day to insisting on showering her even as a teenager, this book is full of triggering content, and i would urge those who have experiences abuse to proceed with caution.i think especially with gen z, we haven’t had a ton of actors from disney and nickelodeon speak out specifically about their experiences on set (the $300,000 offer from Nickelodeon jennette turned down may explain that) and how child acting impacted their lives, and it’s a very necessary perspective to hear as the consumers of that media. hearing some of the things jennette said about her stardom were jarring, in that as children we don’t really know what’s going on behind the scenes and mindlessly consume without regard to the actors lives. i also thought it was super interesting to get the perspective of a very self aware child star that didn’t become super successful on screen after their breakout role, and the narrative she builds around /why/ that was.this book was super impactful, and i have no doubt will reach a large audience. mccurdy's writing style is succinct yet impactful, well organized, balanced with seriousness and humor, told in a very blunt tone. i would definitely recommend listening to the book via audiobook which is narrated by her because it adds a whole new layer of tone. this was a tough reading experience, but i really loved the book and would highly recommend to everyone.Thank you tolibro.fm/simon& schuster for the free arc!",4
382,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"As someone who’s never watched Nickelodeon or anything with this author, I was still highly engrossed in Jennette's story. You can tell she’s more passionate about writing than acting because her writing is of a higher caliber than other celebrity memoirs that were likely ghost-written. She describes events chronologically in such a detailed and engaging way, picking specific memories to demonstrate the dysfunction of her childhood. I appreciated her honesty, dry humor, and even her bitterness and negativity. Her train of thought is very similar to my own mentality (irritability, cynicism, being extremely critical of ourselves, etc) and having that mirrored back from another deeply wounded person was eye-opening. It makes me feel better knowing I'm not the only one who processes life this way... Can we do group therapy together, Jennette?!While I appreciate the level of detail in recalling these events (no easy feat for those dealing with trauma), I would’ve loved to see more reflections of the themes across the book, like her present-day thoughts on her family, Hollywood, child stardom, body image, etc. As well as her learnings from therapy that she’s incorporating moving forward, just to give the rest of us more hope! Regardless, I look forward to seeing her future work and wish her nothing but happiness.",5
383,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"Jennette McCurdy is extremely talented in her writing and i hope she writes more in the future (whatever genre idc, i’ll read anything) because this book alone was a literary masterpiece.it’s very fast pace. i appreciated how Jennette didn’t go into a ton of detail regarding certain subjects. it was just “yup this is was it is, this is how it is, and this is what i’m doing about it” it was very raw and real in my opinion. no flowery languageone thing i’ve seen a lot of people say about this book is “wow she’s so funny, her humor is great, ect.” which i don’t entirely understand since everything Jennette went through and described in this book was devastating. from the multiple forms of abuse, eating disorders, and having to grow up too fast….um where is the humor in that?! i did listen to the audiobook with this (which jennette also narrated) and there’s points in which you hear her actually crying.nonetheless, i’m glad to see Jennette thriving in her writing career which she always wanted. i wish her nothing but the best for her.",5

387,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"Shall we light it up?A bridge.It’s time.When I was in middle school, my mother told me that my glasses were ugly, that the children would call me Four-Eyes. Interesting Fact: No one has ever called me this but my mother.She taught me a cabbage soup diet and how to put on trash bags and go running to lose weight.At the end of a long day, my mom swung by a fast-food restaurant. She demanded that I go up and see what the operating hours were. Being super introverted, I hesitated. She started screaming, letting off a stream of obscenities.While I was in college in my early 20’s, I stopped by my mother’s apartment for a visit. She walked right by me in the parking lot. She said that I was so fat that I looked pregnant, and she didn’t recognize me.When I was making $6.70 per hour, working part-time at Sears, my mother asked that I purchase a $200 set of pajamas for her. When I explained that I didn’t even have $200 to my name, was she sympathetic? No way. She laid into a guilt trip. Did I love her? Didn’t she do so much for me?What has that to do with I’m Glad My Mom Died?I know firsthand what it is like to live with someone who has Borderline Personality Disorder, and Jennette’s mom has the classic symptoms. This book really resonated with me.I’m Glad My Mom Died is an important work. It lets other people know that they aren’t alone, especially if their parents aren’t top 10% parents. Some parents are bottom 10% parents.It has been a long time since I have felt seen. The last book that I felt really conveyed the complexity of a dysfunctional parent-child relationship is The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls.Did I spend years trying to win my mother’s love? Yes. But do I want to be the person that she would love? No.Because I value honesty and intellect. Because I don’t define my self-worth by beauty or popularity.Having a mother with borderline personality disorder has a profound impact on a child’s development.

389,I'm Glad My Mom Died,i am going to read the shit out of this book,5
390,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"I really appreciated Jeannette’s writing style in this book. She’s very cut and dry and to the point. No flowery language or metaphors. That writing style made it feel really raw, transparent, and honest. And it very much feels like Jeannette’s voice.I would also really recommend the audiobook. It was so incredible to hear her story in her voice.The book starts out in Jeannette’s childhood and then progresses to her acting days and then to her adult life post acting. It was a devastating yet eye opening journey to see her come to terms with how much her childhood hugely negatively impacted her life and ruined so many healthy habits she should’ve had in her adult life. And to see how the abusive from her mom was a huge huge part of that.Would highly recommend as long as you check the trigger warnings first!",5
391,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"Whoever said this was: impressively funny???? Was tripping on the cleanest weed out there.I think this is an important book. I love that she was brave enough to write about her life as a child actress, to write about her narcissistic and abusive mother. This auto biography is intense, well written and unbelievably raw.But it still is a book about a girl who was sexually, physically and emotionally abused by her own mother. Please, keep that in mind before you pick this up.The title might be silly, but there isn’t a single drop of humor here. This is the most depressing thing I’ve ever read.Again, I am glad it exists. I am so proud of this girl for being brave enough to put all of this out in the world. I am sure this will help other people who have been through the same.I just don’t think this was properly advertised. This is one of the most intense, gut wrenching and uncomfortable stories you’ll ever read. So make sure you’re ok mentally before you go through it.",3
392,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"THIS DESERVES EVERY OUNCE OF HYPE IT'S BEEN BLESSED WITH!Warning to look up trigger warnings before proceeding. There is a LOT of triggering content in this book. It doesn't shy away from facing problems head on and with an unflinching tone.I adored this book. It is so rare for me to be impacted this deeply.When I tell you I stayed up until 5 am to finish this book because I simply couldn't sleep without knowing Jennette would be okay.I grew up on iCarly. I love Sam. I watched this show with no inkling of an idea of what Jennette was going through. The fact that there are people out there that did know *cough* Dan *cough*, is sickening to me.This isn't JUST a look at how horrifying Hollywood is, especially child stars, but it's also a harrowing depiction of how manipulative love can be. The way a parent's all consuming love for their child can be weaponized and watered to grow into something this vile and life altering is absolute insanity.I truly wish the absolute best for Jennette McCurdy. I know she'll never see this. But my heart goes out to her and everything she has been forced to face. I hope she is awarded every ounce of happiness that a life can possibly offer. She deserves a life of no red lights, no lines, no pauses before 'I love you's. She impacted me so much with her honesty and I can't thank her enough for writing not only a horrifying story but also a damn good book.",5
393,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"I was not a huge fan of Nickelodeon, and I watched their shows only once in a while during my childhood. Drake & Josh and iCarly were the two shows I watched. I particularly remember the part where Sam (Jennette McCurdy) talks about reading in iCarly, which became a famous meme.Her acting in iCarly was spot on and funny. Jennette did a brilliant job while acting, which is why people like me who rarely watched the show still remember her.Whenever we hear the name Jennette McCurdy a bubbly, loud, energetic young lady comes to our mind, as her friend Miranda Cosgrove mentions in this book. This book tells us that there were a lot of hardships and sorrow hidden behind those energetic and brilliant performances.Seven key ideas from this book1) If child labor is unethical, aren't child actors too unethical?During December every year, when it is nearer to Christmas, there is something that everyone all over the world (especially in America) will do. It is to rewatch the Home Alone movie. The family dynamics of the McCallister family, ingenious script by John Huges, brilliant direction by Chris Colombus, fantastic music by John Williams, and extraordinary production design and sets will make us relive our childhood. Home Alone is pure nostalgia for many people.Apart from everything mentioned above, the biggest factor that brings us back to rewatch Home Alone is the amazing acting by Macaulay Culkin. I was shocked when I heard that he had to sacrifice his entire childhood to entertain us. He was abused both physically and mentally by his jealous father. The law caught him with marijuana possession. He was arrested for speeding and many other illegal activities. The abuse has affected his mental health, which pushed him into addiction.Parents using their children as money-making machines by making them actors and making them overwork for different movies when they should be going to school has been a severe issue in the life of many child actors.If we closely observe the career graph of child actors, we can see that only very few become great actors when they grow up.In Jennette's story also, we can see that she was not at all interested in acting. But her mother forced her to act even from the age of six. Nobody even cared to ask her what Jennette liked to do. She tells in this book that she hated acting, which is why she quit acting after her mother died.If child labor is unethical, then child actors are also unethical. Then the million-dollar question of who will do the children's role in the movies will arise. If child actors were not there, how would they have made movies like Harry Potter, where most of the main actors are children?“I HATE ACTING CLASS. Even though it's a chunk of time away from Home, I don't look forward to this class the same way I look forward to church because I find acting even more uncomfortable than being stuck at Home.""2) How did the ""Creator"" make Jennette's life miserable?This is another big problem child actors face, the predators on the shooting sets. The author mentions a ""creator"" who behaved harshly toward her. This same creator also allegedly misbehaved with some other crew members in a sexually inappropriate way.We have heard about many child stars who were sexually harassed on the shooting sets. Some even make them work overtime, destroying the younger kids' enthusiasm and courage.I think the only way to prevent child actors from being exploited by parents and crew members is by appointing an internal committee in every shooting set that even has access to mental health care professionals if needed. This committee should ensure that a certain percentage of children's earnings should be solely used for children's personal needs like education. This will prevent the children from being monetarily misused by their parents.It is challenging to implement this as different countries have different rules and procedures. A very few countries have tried to implement a similar method. But they were all disasters due to their lack of planning and coordination. If Hollywood and people in the USA start implementing it perfectly, all the countries may slowly follow it. A similar rule should be implemented for the children on social media (especially a few family channels on youtube.), even though it will be a little bit more complicated to implement in those cases.“Cut!” The Creator yells off camera, his mouth full of something.""“But our wardrobe designer said that The Creator explicitly asked for bikinis, and so she had to at least have me try on one or two of them so he had the option. ”3) How are children's life affected by their narcissistic parents?Falling into a narcissistic romantic relationship is a harrowing experience. Being the daughter of a narcissistic mother is a much more painful experience. This book shows how her mother totally controlled her daughter's life. The author tells us how proper medical help and therapy after such a long physical and mental abuse helped her recover from such abysmal despair.""My mother emotionally, physically and mentally abused me in ways that will forever impact me.""""I realize that she's happy and I'm not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited.""4) Do we need to romanticize the dead?This is a tough question to answer. Some say objectivity is born after a person dies. It is true that death changes the light in which we see people. But up to what extent? Can mourning alternate realities?These are a few among the many questions I have asked myself after reading one book some time ago on this topic. The author brings this topic back into the limelight.Some people say it is better to speak about the positive sides of the dead person during the time of grief, but not focus on their negative facets as everybody also has a negative side to their personalities along with the positives. But what will we do if the person only has a negative side and the positive side is almost nil? I think it is better to remain silent than to focus on the negatives during mourning.These are the questions that we should contemplate a lot before answering. The answers to the above questions vary depending on the individual's personality and character.“Why do we romanticize the dead? Why can't we be honest about them? Especially moms, they're the most romanticized of anyone. ”5) Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosaBoth anorexia and bulimia are eating disorders. In anorexia, people restrict their food intake to lose weight. In bulimia, people will eat an excessive amount of food in a short period of time and then purge them using various methods to prevent weight gain. Both these disorders will cause severe health problems. For examplein bulimia due to repeated trauma to the esophagus due to vomiting gastric acidic contents, the person can develop esophageal adenocarcinoma.So, this is a serious medical problem that healthcare professionals should treat.""Jennette, what you're describing is... really unhealthy. Your mother essentially condoned your anorexia, encouraged it. She... taught it to you. That's abuse.""6) Friendship.Building a good friendship takes a lot of time, effort, and sacrifice. We can see the author talking about friendships in this book. I remember reading about different types of friendship in a book.Friendships can be classified into three.-1) Friendship of pleasure - Friendship ends when the enjoyment and fun end.- 2) Friendship of convenience - Friendship ends when the convenience factor end.- 3) True friendship - Friendship based on mutual respect.The author mentions that she dislikes friendship of convenience.""I don't like knowing people in the context of things. ""Oh, that's the person I work out with. That's the person I'm in a book club with. That's the person I did that show with."" Because once the context ends, so does the friendship.""7) What is the problem with comparing our life with that of successful people?In this age of social media, every one of us has a tendency to know more about the life of successful people from their social media profiles and compare our life with theirs. The biggest problem is that people only post the positive side of their lives on social media. So checking others' Instagram profiles and comparing our life to others can push us into anxiety and depression.In Jennette's case, she had Ariana Grande as the co-star in one of the shows, and she developed a habit of comparing her life with Ariane's. This is a habit we should never develop, and the author tells us all the troubles she had to face due to this behavior.""The third is that Ariana is at the stage in her career where she's popping up on every 30 Under 30 list that exists. And I'm at the stage in my career where my team is excited that I'm the new face of Rebecca Bonbon, a tween clothing line featuring a cat with her tongue sticking out. Sold exclusively at Walmart. And I frequently make the mistake of comparing my career to Ariana's. I can't help it. I'm constantly in the same environment as her, and she doesn't exactly try to hide her successes.""My favourite three lines from this book""Suddenly, I feel just like that little eleven-year-old girl who was confused and scared and uncertain. That eleven-year-old girl who was doubtful that I knew the whole truth of my situation, who was unsure that my mother was the hero she pretended to be, but who shoved that doubt down.""""I don't like when grown-ups make faces or sounds that I don't understand. It's frustrating. It makes me feel like I'm missing something.”""And the kids who are annoying, don't take direction, ask questions—those are the kids who won't get sent out on auditions. The kids who will get auditions are the ones who shut up and do as they're told.""What could have been better?The title of this book is a brutal one. I think Jennette should have given it a much more positive title. This current title will indeed pull the attention of many new readers to this book. But it also has its demerits. Whenever the author hears or sees the name of this book in the future, the first emotion that will come to her mind might be anger and sadness just because of this title.I can never tell that the author should have forgiven her mother as she had to suffer a lot due to her. But still, I think the title is brutal, and it should have been a different optimistic one.Rating5/5This celebrity memoir might be a difficult book, but you should never miss the opportunity to read it.You can also follow me onInstagram|YouTube First Channel|YouTube Second Channel|Twitter|Snapchat|facebook|TikTok",5

395,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"**Winner of the 2022 Goodreads Choice Award for Memoirs!**Chances are, if you have a TikTok or Instagram you know what this book is. I mean,I'm Glad My Mom Diedwas on back order already the morning it was published and was a sought after title all August and is a book you just cannot avoid if you have an internet connection or local bookstore. Nor should you. Jennette McCurdy, the formeriCarlyactress, speaks so openly and candidly about a lifelong cycle of abuse and dependency with her mother (who passed in, as the title likely led you to assume), chronicling trauma and serious mental health struggles such as eating disorders that all were brought upon her through the need to serve her mother’s wishes. It’s one I’ve had right in everyone’s faces at the bookstore since we finally got copies, as the title is sure to solicit reactions and I privately enjoy seeing them, but also it is an important look at abuse and recovery. I had to finally read it. I mean we all deserve a Hot Girl Summer but can I truly say I had one if I didn’t read any Colleen Hoover, Beach Read or at least this, the most popular book of the end of summer? No. And I’m glad I did pick this up to read at work because this deserves all the hype and more, and I hope this is another success on McCurdy's road to improved mental health. While she loved her mother, their relationship was often abusive and left a lot to detangle in adulthood. Deeply personal and moving, this is a look into McCurdy's life as well as a necessary warning about the ways young girls are objectified, commodified and exploited, even by those closest to them.‘I realize that she’s happy and I’m not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited.’That line says it all, honestly. This is an upsetting account of McCurdy's life, and one where all the warning signs were out in the open and ignored. Especially by Nickelodeon who don’t exactly come across well here. We’ve heard horror stories about the treatment of child actors for as long as there have been child actors, though this isn’t simply another case file of grievances but a really heartfelt self-examination and testimony. McCurdy comes across as very open and honest, and it really paints a positive look at her as a person who has gone through so much. There are times when she discusses the anger she felt, which feels justified and asSoraya Chemalytalks about in the bookRage Becomes Her: The Power of Women's Anger, sometimes anger is the appropriate response in order to not be silenced or ignored. It can be an important tool, or an armor as McCurdy describes:‘I became an angry person with no tolerance for anyone. I'm aware of this shift and yet have no desire to change it. If anything, I want it. It's armor. It's easier to be angry than to feel to pain underneath it.’She also expresses feelings of regret for having lashed out in these times, looking at how abuse shouldn’t just beget another cycle of abuse, and these discussions seem to come from a place of maturity and healing. It is likely very encouraging and empowering for victims of abuse to read much of this book, though heads up, it does get into some very triggering situations and topics.‘Mom only sits in when I’m being the thing she wanted to be.’McCurdy shows how so much of her life was lived to be what her mother wanted, and much of this became painful. She was raised in a Mormon household and was homeschooled by her mother, a mom who wanted to always present a perfect image and often lashed out hurtfully. In short, McCurdy is open about her mom having narcissistic tendencies, and while she is still caring for her mother (she does make it clear she very much loved her mother), the scars are quickly apparent. From years of life like this, McCurdy felt she lacked an authentic self, and this carried over into struggles with body image from seeing one’s own self as an object that serves others instead of something personally only yours. This is a major theme in the essays inMy BodybyEmily Ratajkowskifor those looking for further reading on the subject. When fearing her breasts would grow during puberty, the mother encouraged extreme calorie reduction and dangerous dieting practices. While discussions of the mother bookend this memoir, the bulk of the middle portion is about eating disorders. Most tragic is the moment in the hospital with her siblings saying goodbye to her mother when she says the one thing she thinks could actually make her mother proud of her:‘I'm in the ICU with my dying mother, and the thing that I'm sure will get her to wake up, is the fact that in the days since mom has been hospitalized, my fear and sadness have morphed into the perfect anorexia motivation cocktail, and finally I have achieved mom's current goal weight for me: 89 pounds.’There is a lot to be said about the ways this reflects a general attitude around young women and girls, especially in the entertainment industry and how it robs them of their own agency. ‘I was conditioned to believe any boundary I wanted was a betrayal of her, so I stayed silent,’ she writes, and in this we see how these systems perpetuate themselves: silence. Young women and girls are broken down to believe they are in service to another (we could get into a long discussion on how this is the social framing inflicted by the intersections of misogyny and capitalism) and silence is induced by making them first feel they wouldn’t be believed or listened to but also that they deserve it, it’s for their own good or that they don’t even have the agency to speak out. It is truly tragic how often victims of abuse are silenced when they do speak out, which is another tool in oppression.So this book is a lot, but it is also very good and seems very healing. I was under the impression based on how it was presented and marketed that this was more of a comedic memoir, so heads up if that was what you assumed as well, but the weight and power of her words as she discusses a lifetime of abuse is definitely worth reading for. It does read very plainly, almost like a “class assignment” type of tone recounting events, though they are certainly difficult memories to have to revisit. I hope McCurdy is doing well, and it is very honorable of her to use her experience to reach out and help others in this way. There could have been more depth to some of it, but this is less a look at the causes and social critiques and more at the personal effects she endured. There are great reminders too about how to move forward and not get bogged down in being perfect, such as when she writes that ‘slips are totally normal. When you have a slip, it’s just that. A slip. It doesn’t define you. It doesn’t make you a failure. The most important thing is that you don’t let that slip become a slide‘. I won’t get too much more into it, as you should probably read the book and this is McCurdy's story to tell, but I am very glad I read this.'My mom didn't get better. But I will.'",4
396,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"I’m happy Jennette was able to tell her story and show how terrible it is to have such an abusive mom and what the entertainment industry can do to a child.My rating does not reflect how true and important the telling of her story is.The writing of the story however, was very painful to get through. It could have been edited better with how repetitive it is. It also has no self reflecting within the story, not that she isn’t a victim cuz she is. How she viewed other women and other women friendships also bothered me. I can see how coming from such a competitive career like acting could HAVE caused that but, I would HAVE loved to see some self-reflecting on that part as well.",2

399,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"Wow. A very revealing and honest memoir. Unsure what parts people found funny. I didn’t laugh once and didn’t see any parts that were structured for humor.Nickelodeon and Disney was a huge part of my childhood and I loved iCarly and loved Sam. Hearing Jennette’s story is another example of how you don’t know what’s happening to someone behind closed doors. As talented as she was in acting, I’m glad she made the decision to walk away. No one should be forced into a career they never wanted - especially a career as draining and consuming emotionally, mentally and physically as acting.Her mother’s abuse was tough to hear. It’s more painful to see how much Jennette wanted to appease her mom all the way until the very end of her life. She consistently put her mom’s needs before her own and her mom would willingly exploit and manipulate her knowing this.The title and cover is alarming and provocative but justified. If you assume Jennette never loved her mother, the story proves the exact opposite. The title is not a reflection of Jennette but the treatment of her mother towards her. Her mother severely betrayed and abused her and Jennette loved her while she was alive despite it. But time and healing allowed her to see the long term damage her mother has done and some damage is irreversible. Her story sheds more light to how we shouldn’t turn a blind eye to all the different forms, relationships and dynamics abuse can happen. If anything, parental abuse should be looked at with the utmost seriousness due to the power dynamic and pressures to love your family despite their faults, even when they hurt you.I could go on, but if any part of her story interests you, I would recommend reading. Major trigger warnings for abuse, eating disorders, bulimia, and anorexia. She is very blunt and candid about her life with eating disorders.Jennette from an early age wanted to write but her mom didn’t support her. I’m glad Jennette is finally able to do what she always wanted.",5
400,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"my blog reviewTW:Anorexia, abuse (emotional, child), bulimia, cancer, eating disorders, drugs and alcohol abuse, death, grief, mental illness, manipulation, grooming.To me, reading and rating a memoir is something delicate, because that person is opening up about their experiences, their traumas, thoughts and emotions that are very private or painful sometimes.Wow, I have no words. I'm just proud of Jennette and wish for her the best because she deserves a good life, happiness and so much love.Must of us grew up watching Nickelodeon shows like iCarly, Drake & Josh, Big Time Rush, Zoey 101 and many more, laughing at many characters' jokes or actions, not knowing that perhaps some of those actors were having a really bad time.This memoir isn't about Jennette's days in Nickelodeon, yes, she talks about some of her struggles. This memoir is about her early years, before and getting in the entertainment industry, her teen years and early adulthood. It's really painful to read about Jennette's struggles with food. While on iCarly she (her character) was obsessed with food, Jennette was obsessed with it, too, but not in the same way. Her mother impossed onto her this unhealthy routine that developed in anorexia and years later in bulimia.This book is totally worth to read. And I totally loved it. Jennette is a wonderful story-teller, I liked the writing, that is so captivating and beautiful.I'm really proud of her and wish to her nothing but happiness.",5
401,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"Memoirs should be one’s reflection about one’s past, otherwise is just ajournaling exercise.This whole book feltjuvenile, repetitive and under-edited.The dialogues were weird and unbelievable because they totally lacked context (and before someone misinterprets my words, I am not saying that I don’t believe Jennette words, but that simply writing down her abusive mother’s worst moments is cathartic, yes, but it’s not in any way compelling to read, because there is no built-up, no tension, just straight up abuse).The inexplicable decision of using a present tensekilled every chance of expressing self-awareness, self-reflection and healing, and the book felt like a journaling therapy exercise. It didn’t help the fact that writing the memoir focusing on traumas and single events, each one of them taking up one short chapter, made the “narration” very disjointed.The blurb is also very unfaithful to the actual content of the book: this memoir was described as “heartbreaking” and “hilarious”, and I have my doubts about the latter. I smiled twice, in the space of 92 chapters.As a person who has a strained relationship with her mentally-ill mother,I am proud of Jennette for being able to tell her story, but unfortunately her memoir fell short, for me.",1
402,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"I devoured this book, it hit close to home in a way I did not fully expect. The writing was a bit terse at times, so maybe 4.5 stars?? Idk I feel weird rating memoirs obviously but the honesty and vulnerability and truth in McCurdy’s story was shocking and incredible. I wish nothing but the best for her!! But also based off of her narration of her own life, I wonder if she is gay???? Sorry sorry I’m lesbian projecting maybe but like… anyways this peak into the horror and brutality of child stardom and Hollywood’s bullshit was so moving and insightful, and the shift from a childish voice and perspective at the beginning of the book as it progressed onward was well done I think. I feel like anyone who’s seen any episode of iCarly or any other Nickelodeon show should definitely read this…",5
403,I'm Glad My Mom Died,"When my two kids were young, I used to watch iCarly with them every week. I'm actually not sure who enjoyed it more, me or them, to be honest! Anyone who watched the Nickelodeon show knows that Jennette McCurdy's character, Sam Puckett, wasn't one to mince words. Her sarcastic, jaded humor was one of the funniest aspects of the show, and I appreciated that she was a character without pretense - a ""what you see is what you get"" type.Fast forward ten years, and now Jennette McCurdy, unencumbered by a character she seems to wish she'd never had to embody, has written her own truth. It's raw, unfiltered and without pretense and possesses more than a little of that jaded humor, suggesting that maybe you can never fully escape who you are, even when you're acting.At its heart, this is a book about Jennette surviving the trauma of her mother Debra's abuse and the multitude of ways it impacted her sense of identity, mental health, coping mechanisms and life choices. It's about a girl who couldn't separate who she was from who her mother insisted she be. It's about a girl who lost the chance to follow her own dreams while her mother vicariously lived hers through her only daughter. It's about a mom using her survival against cancer and the family's Mormon faith to emotionally entrap and manipulate her daughter into behaving as she wished lest Jennette's 'disobedience' cause Debra's sickness to return. It's about a girl so enmeshed with her mother that even when she finally moved out into her first apartment, her mother used her illness as an excuse to move in with her.This isn't run-of-the-mill stage mom stuff. This is a vivid portrayal of the impact a narcissistic, manipulative parent can have on their child. It just so happens the person involved is famous. Jennette was pushed into a career she didn't want at six years old. She experienced extreme anxiety, OCD, panic attacks, codependency and sexual, verbal and emotional abuse at the hands of her mother. She experienced inappropriate overtures and manipulation at the hands of a Nickelodeon figure, simply named ""The Creator"" in the book, but undoubtedly Dan Schneider, who created iCarly. Perhaps worst of all, and this is something that many who experience trauma will understand, is what she suffered at her own hands trying to cope with the abuse. She developed anorexia, bulimia, alcoholism, questionable sexual relationships, anger issues, and deep-seated insecurity that continued well after Debra's eventual death.These are darker topics, but what Jennette did so well in this memoir is to lay things bare and be vulnerable with her pain while balancing it with her wit and humor. She takes you through her emotional journey and leaves you with the sense that, after much reflection and therapy, she'll be OK and that those experiencing similar things in their lives can be too. I listened to the audiobook read by the author herself, and it felt like an intimate conversation between her and her audience. It's very well written, and I have every confidence it's only the beginning of the writing career SHE wanted!★★★★",4
404,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","202.That’s the number of times that the word “mate,” in any of its hellish forms, is used in this book.TWO.HUNDRED.AND.TWO.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...That statistic alone should be enough to justify this one star rating. If you feel satisfied enough to just remove yourself from this review, run with that feeling. Because I have, like. Seven pages of sh*t to complain about.That’s if I’m efficient.And I’ve never been an efficient reviewer. Once. In my life. I counted two hundred (and two) uses of a word over seven hundred pages. That shouldn’t scream “rational and in control of her passionate fury” to you.So buckle up, buttercup. We’ve got some categories to run through.DISCLAIMER: This review is teeming with spoilers. It is also X-rated, due to the strength of my anger and the copious sex scenes in the source material.I HATE THESE CHARACTERSRhysmakes me cringe harder than Renee Zellweger in Bridget Jones’ Diary. (At least that movie has both Colin Firth and Hugh Grant to distract me from Renee viciously critiquing her own body and, like, spilling coffee all over herself or whatever.) He is capable of two actions, like a mildly impressive Ken doll: 1) sex person and 2) valiant hero trying to kill himself in the name of his friends constantly. Either he is full on f*cking Feyre (sick alliteration, Emma) or he must be actively prevented from jumping in front of poisoned weapons with the half-hearted motivation of Heroism To Save My Family (even if it’s not at all clear why doing this would save them, because whatever none of the plans in this book make a lick of sense anyway).Because, as if this book weren’t fun enough, it rivals the Fast and the Furious franchise for use of the my-real-family-is-the-one-I-made-not-the-one-I-was-born-with cliché.Like Rhys,Feyrealso manages to find time in her packed schedule of sex scenes and repetitive dialogue to be incredibly, incontrovertibly dumb. For example, when she traps Ianthe and ties her up or whatever, she spends an unbelievable amount of time indulging an evil-villain-revenge rant. Just enough time for her to be CAUGHT BY THE DAEMATI (a Cassandra Clare-esque douchey term that pretty much means “species of bad guy,” to the best of my recollection). So much of this book was me silently screaming.Speaking of the aforementioned schedule, it’s no wonder that that thing Feyre used to do called “painting” is dropped like a hot potato. She never does it, but it’s mentioned a handful of times in the beginning of the book. And then forgotten. And then, suddenly, almost at the merciful end of this suffering:“The movement so perfect that I knew I’d one day paint it.”We’restillpretending that Feyre paints? Between the same diverse selection of identical sex scenes, identical training scenes, identical war discussion scenes, I don’t think she has time for something so banal as a singular interest or hobby. Idk if we’ll have time; I think she’ll have to get to third base with Rhys in a perfumed bath later.At least Feyre is brave and strong, though. Which is why she’s “too tired” to do anything after a loooong day of watching other people fight in a battle, followed by Mor winnowing her home. So courageous. How does she do it.Plus, she’s a brilliant friend. Which is why, when Morrigan confronts her for lying, leaving, making her and everyone else fear she has died and also making Mor responsible for it, Feyre’s response is “OH YA??? WELL YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON AZRIEL.”Truly a depiction of a powerful woman for the ages.And I don’t getLucien’s appeal. Do we like him out of the same reason we like Draco? (I’m saying “we” as if I like either of those characters.) Is it an omg-he’s-just-trying-to-do-right-he-didn’t-know-any-better type situation? Because Draco is a child trying to impress a father who doesn’t love him and I still don’t totally buy that. I’m still not a Draco fan. And Tamlin is not Lucien’s daddy, although...maybe a more interesting book if he were.CassianandAzrielare both flat and boring.Amrenis characterized so inconsistently that it’s impossible for me to know whether I like her or not. (I’m going to say “not” - seems like a safer bet.)Nestais almost cool, but the whole I Am Mean And Hard And Damaged thing goes too far. AndElainjust floats around and lets things happen to her.Morrigan, never all that interesting, now just represents the worst bisexuality rep I’ve ever read.It’s never a good sign when you’re praying for characters to die in battle just so you can catch a f*cking break.But guess what. None of them do.THE WRITING SUCKS, ON BOTH A COPYEDITING LEVEL AND A SUBSTANTIVE LEVELI truly believe that whatever team of sad sacks was assigned to copyedit this book was physically unable to attentively read it. And I cannot blame them. But it does allow for some hilarious mistakes to make it through these dull, dull pages.Example: “She did not avert her eyes from the Morrigan.” That pesky “the” makes her seem like a pro wrestler, or someone with a fun nickname, rather than the personification of the worst bi rep ever to grace young adult pages. But we’ll get to that.There are so many ellipses and dashes and italicizations and...other - ways: ofbreakingup the TEXT that it actually gave me motion sickness. On top of everything else this book has made me suffer through.Maybe if a copyeditor had found the strength to make it through this book, they could have stopped the way SJM insists on using the term “Hybern.” IT MEANS SO MANY THINGS. “Hybern” is used as the nomer of the evil king, the word for his people, the name of his kingdom, and the title of the land it’s situated on. That is just...basic bad worldbuilding, no?Also, a monster creature thing described as having no eyelids narrows its eyes. This inspired a fifteen minute long discussion with my roommates on whether eyes can narrow without eyelids. We came to a unanimous consensus: no, they cannot.Also, asValpointed out in her amazing review of this book, the words “vulgar gesture” are used over. And over. And over again. WHAT DO THESE USES MEAN. WHY DO THEY CONSTANTLY INSPIRE LAUGHTER IN WHATEVERGLORIFIED PROPCHARACTER WHO HAPPENS TO BE NEARBY. IS THIS TACTIC SUPPOSED TO REPLACE ACTUAL JOKES OR BANTER? Because it doesn’t. It just makes me angry, and also confused, which makes meeven angrier.And who thought that was even possible.WHAT IS THIS ATTEMPT AT HIGH FANTASY LANGUAGEExcept then, y’know, Rhys and Feyre and the Gang are also so hip and cool and up to date that this book uses the word “fuckable,” a word so slang-y that my laptop recognizes it as a typo for “suckable” or “faceable,” whatever the hell those words are.Otherwise, the only other remarkable attempt at making this any different from the way humans speak in 2017: the use of the word “male.”Women are sometimes called “females” in this, but are also called women and girls and whatnot. Men, on the other hand, are absolutely only called males. There’s an amazing moment when SJM refers to Rhys as a man, and then instantly, like, corrects herself. So it reads on the page as “man - male -”It makes no sense. I love it.It’s truly the little things.THE END OF THIS BOOK IS JUST A LISTING OF CLICHESAs the war we’ve waited for finally arrives, and so does the time for motivational speeches and tragic goodbyes and other things that fail to make me feel something, SJM loses it entirely.Nearly every line of dialogue in this section is just a cliché, and so I will copy and paste them here, for your perusal and accompanying amusement.“Leave this world…a better place than how you found it.”“One life may change the world.”“I believe everything happens for a reason.”“It is the family you make, not the one you are born into, that matters.”“Light can be found even in the darkest of hells.”“The great joy and honor of my life has been to know you.”“I wasn’t sure if in the entire history of Illyria, there had ever been such a discussion.”So bad. And, therefore, so good.LET’S LAUGH AT DUMB THINGSThe moments when this may or may not be attempting to instill some sort of entertainment or amusement in its reader do not work at all. Luckily, we have something much better: Really dumb stuff. It is much more fun (and nourishing to the very soul, like a bowl of chicken soup - so pretty much the series of books “Chicken Soup for the Soul”) to laugh at something unintentional and dumb than it is to laugh at a cheap joke. This is why the show America’s Funniest Home Videos has been on for twenty-eight seasons, and like a thousand interchangeable bad sitcoms are canceled every year.For example, this passage. Feyre and Rhysand are apart, blah blah blah, it’s the tragedy of the century (or millennium, since these boring ass people live for infinity, because there is no justice in this world). Unsurprisingly, they use their mind control powers for a saintly motivation: sexting. Which is already so hilarious. But it gets even better, because:“I sent back an image of me sticking out my tongue at him.My clothes were back on when his answer arrived.Like mine, it was wordless, a mere image. Like mine, Rhysand’s tongue was out.But it was occupied with doing something else.”I choose to interpret this statement the same way a middle schooler interprets the existence of performer Marilyn Manson based on a shady rumor he once heard about a surgery to remove three ribs. I believe that this is incontrovertible evidence that Rhysand can suck his own d*ck. WHAT ELSE COULD HE POSSIBLY BE DOING. WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY BE OCCUPIED WITH. SJM I JUST WANNA TALK.But just as often as I was making myself laugh by making Rhys my YA fantasy version of Marilyn Manson, I was being equally amused by seemingly innocuous lines. Like when Eris, scary villain/abuser extraordinaire, was bidding The Night Gang adieu and said, “See you at the meeting in twelve days.” I MEAN. WHAT. WHO SPEAKS LIKE THAT. Even dialogue is just an opportunity to force an info dump. You guys, seriously: this book isso poorly written.LET’S SCREAM ABOUT DUMB THINGSSometimes, or most of the time depending on how you look at it, I do not want to laugh at the dumb things. Sometimes I am incapable of it, because this book is an ungodly length and so much of it is long-term stupidity.Chapter 45, for example. Or, as I like to call it, “That Meeting in Twelve Days Finally Happens.” Yes, this book is so boring that we are expected to anticipate an actual, literal meeting. Sure, it’s a meeting between high lords to talk about war, but it’s still a sit-down political discussion. And also it’s just the same endless repetitive cycle of insult dialogue feat. fun moments of The Night Gang being the least convincing people on the entirety of the Earth.There’s an especially great moment in that adrenaline-inducing conference. For the 800 pages leading up to it, Rhys is all,“Ok, Feyre. Listen up. Number one thing - just don’t show your powers, k? Long story short the Powerful Men are going to get pissy and then…well y’know these negotiations are the most important thing to happen in hundreds of years, which I should know because I’ve been alive for that long, even though you’re, what, fresh outta adolescence? Anyway just the only thing you should do is not show your powers.”To which Feyre’s response is,“Got it. *shows powers instantly*”YES. Feyre shows her powers at the meeting!! So quickly!!! She doesn’t even try all that hard, and, as promised, it almost derails the nonstop excitement of this much-anticipated civilized forum! Almost. Except then everything works out, as it always does, by Feyre saying something totally normal, 6/10 at best, and everyone being like “wow omg...who is this girl...she is so smart and brave and honest and we respect her so much” so that Rhys can be like “that’s my mate lol.”IRRELEVANT COMPLAININGThe only way to make the experience of reading a deeply unpleasant, extremely long book worse is to publish that book with goddamn tissue paper pages. This was like reading the Bible but without the action. And with a whole lot more smut.I’m tucking this quote in this section too, because I don’t know if I’m being persnickety, but at one point, it’s said that“Only a madman would wield the might of his army just to get revenge on three women.”And my question is, why use the word “women”? Why not “people”? Is it more insane if it’s women? Why is that? TELL ME WHY. REALLY I JUST WANNA TALK.PLOTLINE? WHAT PLOTLINEThis book is just...so boring.There are countless info dumps, which, I mean. There’s no excuse for that in a third book. This was going to be the last book in the series, when there was still hope in the world and I prayed that somehow SJM actually was writing these books for some sort of artistic fulfillment rather than money. How, I ask you, would there still be so much sh*tty worldbuilding in the last book in a series?OH YES, THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY WOKE AND NOT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THAT ENTIRELYSJM has been getting a lot of sh*t lately for her white/straight/cis narratives. So it’s no surprise that she would try to get those pesky activists off her back this time. Unfortunately, she does a remarkably bad job.This book is all straight people except for LGBT+ relationships based on sex alone, or in an unequal relationship wherein one person has authority over another. (Examples: a high lord whose bisexuality extends purely to the fact that he’s into threesomes; a military captain dating his high lord/commander/boss.)Plus, there’s bisexuality rep so terrible it took me hours to make it through a handful of pages. But that gets a category of its own.I also shouldn’t be surprised at the redemption of abusers in this book. Because Tamlin, in ACOTAR, was just a Nice Guy. Fine. But the fangirls loved a certain bad boy guest star with purple eyes. So, instead of creating a love triangle or transitioning between love interests like a normal person, SJM made him into an actual abuser. A villain.That’s also fine. But you can’t just redeem him like you could redeem the unloved side of a love triangle. Because you made him into a genuinely bad person.Unfortunately, SJM must have missed that memo. She must have missed it three times, actually, because Eris also gets redemption (and a throne!). As does his enabler brother, Lucien. Wonderful. Abuse apologists for the win.But this book is totally, definitely feminist, right??? I mean, female protagonist! War plotline! It must be, by default! So when Cassian says“I told you that the moment we started letting females into our group, they’d be nothing but trouble”, and woke king Rhys responds,“You actually said you needed a reprieve from staring at our ugly faces, and that someladieswould add some much needed prettiness for you to look at all day.”it’s totally fine!So it’s an utter shock that this narrative also lives nearly entirely within the bounds of gender roles. Reading about men (Rhys, Cassian, Azriel, all the high lords) fighting in battle while the women (Feyre, Mor, Elain, Nesta, Cresseida) watch and tend to the wounded later is sorefreshing. Doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out at all.And no, Mor being assigned to babysit Feyre later on, only heading into battle because Feyre tricks her into fighting so she can sneak away does not make it better, thanks.This is definitely, certainly the feminist YA fantasy you’ve been waiting for, folks.THE WORST BI REP EVER TO HIT THE SHELVES, WHICH IS INSANE BECAUSE WHEN IS THERE E V E R GOOD BI REPBut I haven’t mentioned the most unforgivable thing yet. The thing that made this book my first SJM one-star, after giving every other book I’ve read by her two stars. The thing that actually made me feel real hatred and fury and, worst of all, sadness.Truly, the worst bisexual representation I have ever read comes in the final chapters of this book. I’ve read a lot of bad bisexual rep. And it’s endlessly upsetting. But none of it felt quite like this.Apparently, Sarah J. Maas decided in the third book that she wanted to stop getting sh*t for her heteronormativity. So she decided to take a character who had been established as straight, and make her bi.So she took this character, Morrigan. She makes Morrigan cry. She writes Morrigan’s impassioned speech to Feyre. This is Morrigan’s coming out, for the first time. Morrigan says that she prefers women. To the point that she is only capable of feeling romantic love for a women.But occasionally, she will force herself to sleep with a man. In order “to keep people from looking too closely.” Instead of telling the man who has been in love with her for centuries that she doesn’t love him back, won’t ever love him back, she forces herself to sleep with men when he’ll know that she’s done it, so that she still seems straight but he’ll know she doesn’t love him.And the author dubs it bisexuality.I hate that she felt entitled to use this underrepresented, misunderstood sexuality as a playing piece in her own quest to be well-liked. I hate that the hundreds of thousands of people who read this book have been given this depiction of bisexuality. And I hate that Sarah J. Maas will keep writing wildly successful books. Books in this very series, depicting this character in this way and calling it “bisexuality.”It’s unfair. It’s awful. And I am never, never, never going to forget that it happened.Bottom line: I didn’t expect to like this book. But I also didn’t expect it would become one of my least favorite books I’ve ever read.----pre-reviewI did it.Everyone told me I couldn't do it.Just DNF it,they said.You're being insane,they said.Why would you force yourself through 700 pages of misery? Actually, didn't you hate the second book? Why did you even pick up the third book, you f*cking fool?And you know what? They were right, because that was stupid.But also THEY WERE WRONG, because I FINISHED THIS GODDAMN NIGHTMARE OF A NOVEL.It may have taken me eight months. But it's over.Review (of a lifetime) to come----currently-reading updatesTHIS MONTH IS THE MONTH WHEN I FINISH THIS BOOK.----150 pages in and already bored as hell.Cauldron help me make it through",1
405,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","*Do I need to remind you to be civil? No, I don’t. Good kids.“You High Lords really do love your melodrama, don’t you?”(As if I hadn't got enough ammo already.)For honesty's sake, the last two thirds of the book I could only bring myself to skim through (and I'm quite proud of myself for managing even that). The first third had accurately enlightened me as to what I was to expect, and my (abysmally low) expectations were met point by point.We girls of the SmutClub weren't able to do a proper buddy read as we did last year with ACoMaF due to real life kicking our asses. However, I'm sure you don't want to missSarah'sandReyes'sreviews, andEmer'scall for honesty and good sense when it comes tothe target market of this series(and of theThrone of Glassseries too, at this point) perfectly highlights a problem I haven't been able to wrap my mind around since it first arose.•First of all, I'd like to take a moment to answer a question that no one asked but that I think it fair to take into account nonetheless, said question being, ""If you evidently don't like Maas's books, why do you keep reading them?""Very good point indeed.I used to consider her books a guilty pleasureuntil, well, yesterday. The word ""pleasure"" in that expression, though, baffled me very much even before. More correctly, reading her was an experience akin to getting your first period at school and noticing too late (mortallyembarrassing), while ranting about it later was an honest if inclement exercise in snark, just as reading other people's reviews with previous knowledge of the book was pure amusement, be them positive or negative, and this latter reason is probably what always convinced me to suffer a little for the greater fun. Sometimes I also enjoyed some parts, so mine wasn't all sadism, after all. ButA Court of Wings and Ruin? (I still have no clue about what this absurd title is supposed to mean.) This one wassheer torture.A bore. Like havinga pitchfork repeatedly shoved in the eyeballs.(I should refer you tomy review ofA Court of Mist and Fury, which already contains many, if not all, of the issues I had with this final installment too, because since I've read that book with way more attention than I did ACoWaR, you'd probably find that one more specific and generally accurate.)•The writing gets worse. It's a miracle -or whatever its opposite would be called. Saying that it'smelodramaticdoesn't begin to describe it anymore; admitting that its basic rule isemotional manipulationwould be such an understatement, my fingers itch. Everything is amplified, everything is exaggerated, everything makes twice the noise that it should make proportionally to its dimensions. Which is to say,everything becomes grotesque.Ridiculousness abounds, especially when matters of the heart (you haveno ideahow much I struggled not to use some other word that would have been more fit to the case at hand there) are concerned. I'll make just two quick examples both taken from chapter 14.The examples may contain mild spoilers.“Where are my sisters?” The thought clanged through me, jarring as a pealing bell.Rhys paused, hand slipping from my hair as his smile faded. “At the House of Wind.” He straightened, swallowing—as if it somehow checked him. “I can—take you to them.” Every word seemed to be an effort.But he would, I realized. He’d shove down his need for me and take me to them, if that was what I wanted. My choice.It had always been my choice with him.”To spell it out, what Feyre's voice is implying here is that one point in the never-ending list of reasons why Rhysand is worth worshipping is that he is able to keep it in his pants ten minutes longer so that she can go say hello to her sisters, whom she hasn't seen in more than a month and who, last she saw them, had just undergone a devastating trauma. It is evident that Maas isstillshoving in our faces that wemustabsolutely love Rhysand... a pity she isstillpicking all the wrong reasons, because what I think when I read a scene like this is ""Someone please lock him away"" (and I'm being kind).Example number two(trigger warning: this one's rather disgusting. I for sure gagged once or twice.), this oneto show what I mean by ""overwritten"" and ""grotesque"" and ""ew"":“You have a choice,” he murmured against my cheekbone. “Either I lick every inch of you clean …” His hand grazed the tip of my breast, circling lazily. As if we had days and days to do this. “Or you can get into the bath that should be ready by now.”I pulled away, lifting a brow. “Are you suggesting that I smell?”Rhys smirked, and I could have sworn my core pounded in answer. “Never. But …” His eyes darkened, the desire and amusement fading as he took in my clothes.“There is blood on you. Yours, and others’. I thought I’d be a good mate and offer you a bath before I ravish you wholly.”I huffed a laugh and brushed back his hair, savoring the silken, sable strands between my fingers. “So considerate. ThoughI can’t believe you kicked everyone out of the house so you could take me to bed.”“One of the many benefits to being High Lord.”“What a terrible abuse of power.”That half smile danced on his mouth. “Well?”“As much as I’d like to see you attempt to lick off a week’s worth of dirt, sweat, and blood…”His eyes gleamed with the challenge, and I laughed again. “Normal bath, please.”You see what I mean? Maas triesso hardto write steamy, sexy moments that she stopped noticing that the way she writes them became (a long time ago I dare say)utterly ridiculous. What sane person in their right mind would ever say ""I’d like to see you attempt to lick off a week’s worth of dirt, sweat, and blood off me?""Many, many,many, if not all, of the problems this book has are linked to the writing,silly,childish,bloated,cheesy. It sourseverything.•Not totally disconnected from this, there is also the insistence with whichFeyre's bliss with her Court of Friends and Familyis continually trotted out, especially if there's the opportunity to describe it through someone else's point of view, as it happens with Lucien's in the first part of the book.There is a reason if one of the axioms of storytelling is that talking about happiness is difficult: it's uninteresting, poor of nuances, syrupy: people don't want to hear about happiness. “Happy families are all alike,” after all.•One of the main points ofFeyre's character arcshould be her discovery of independence and of her inner strength, of the fact that she doesn't necessarily need anyone, especially a man, to guide and direct her every step. A shame the impression we get from the whole series isthe very opposite: Feyre's character growth (not automatically meant as an upward trajectory) seems to be irreversiblyconnected to the ""male"" who is (even virtually) at her side. In this book, she and Rhysand are pretty much a single entity. Can I feel a tinge of outrage at this, please? We women are very able to be complete on our own, thank you very much. The whole""mating system"" (I can't even, it's too ridiculous)has me not exactly convinced in this regard too. Various characters throughout the book keep having this attitude, especially towards Feyre, that impliesa vision of women as mere objects of sexual interest, pawns in a purely male game of lust and authority, and they are never challenged because their brain is full of crap, but simply because they insult Feyre–and not even Feyre as herself, but Feyre as Rhysand's mate, like during the meeting of the High Lords in chapter 46, when someone calls Feyre ""human filth"" and Rhysand's reply is physical violence plus a laconic“Don’t ever,” Rhys said, hands sliding into his pockets, “speak tomy matelike that again.”Again, everything, even on the level of language, revolves around a man and the girl's relationship to said man. I fail to see the women's empowerment in this.•I've never seensuch a cheesy ending. It feltlike I had just swallowed a monumental bucket of melted sugarand I couldn't even breathe because the very air got stuck to the sticky back of my throat. Basically it made me finally understand that Maas's main interest was to make sure none of her precious babies got so much as a scratch.➽ I was trying to find a way to be tactful and diplomatic about this, but there is none. The first book was nice and very entertaining, the second was still entertaining but way less nice,the third is ignoble. Bottom line:this series is crap.Don't read it(and if you know me and my reviews, you know Ineveronce recommendednotto read a book, nor do I think I shall ever do it again, because the fact that I don't like something doesn't mean that nobody would or should. Besides, I don't really believe in second-hand opinions. So the fact that I think this book will actively damage your brains and that I'm warning you off it should really speak volumes in itself). There are far more worthy books out there waiting for you.",1

It's unpolished, full of unnecessary repetition and lazy placeholder sentences.Maascanwrite. She's proved it over and over again, which makes ACOWAR seem almost criminal. I think the strain of writing two novels a year finally caught up with her. ACOTAR AND ACOMAF don't really count because they were written long beforeThrone of Glasswas published. All she had to do was clean up. But ACOWAR was written back-to-back withEmpire of Storms, which was a beefy number on its own.Fervent as I was for ACOWAR, I wouldn't have minded waiting another year if it meant getting quality content.Second is the ending.Rhys lives, Amren lives, everybody fucking lives.Where are the sacrifices? How it can possible that no one in this bloated main cast dies? (Don't you bloody dare point to Feyre's dad. He was barely a presence the entire series, and I remain firmly convinced Maas brought him back just to fill the death toll and shut up people like me.)I understand Rhys's resurrection—he's Feyre's mate and fan favorite and therefore too important to die—but Amren too? Her losing her godly power is not a sacrifice. She's still High Fae. Why not make her human? Why not have a human serve in the Night Court? Or why not have Cassian or someone else lose their wings? Quite a few reviewers (and me included) havementioned this already, but Maas undeniably has an obsession with inhumanly powerful characters.On the subject of Rhys, it would have been so, so cool for Feyre to be the sole ruler of the Night Court. The first High Lady in history. And it would have been a fitting end to her character arc. She was dependent on a man in the first book, was broken by the same man in the second, and then healed and made to see she could be powerful and independent by another man. In the third, she stands alone, back straight, strong and proud, without a man. Obviously I'm oversimplifying things here, but you can't deny the pieces line up.Also, that deus ex machina army in the end. Oh, we're on the edge of losing! All is lost! BUT WAIT here's an army. And ANOTHER army!Another thing that bothered me is howunbelievably powerful Feyre is.There is feminism, which is an underlying theme for her character, and there is what-the-fuckery. Near the beginning of the book, she is able to take on two daemati (powerful fae) who have a thousand years of fighting experience over her. Later, after she accidentally ingests a drug that strips her of her powers, they still magically flare back to life to help her triumph over two seasoned High Fae fighters.Right, I think I've bitched enough about the bad.Let's get to the good.I love the characters.The Inner Circle, Lucien, Nesta, Elain... they are a huge part why I rated ACOWAR as high as it is. Feyre and Rhys—in this book and this book only—aren't as interesting. Their story in terms of conflict was finished in ACOMAF and although I enjoy how Maas explores how normal couples argue and make up, I'm not as invested in them as before. There are too many other stories begging to be told: Lucien's, Elain's, Nesta and Cassian's, Mor's, Tamlin's.Yes, Tamlin. This fandom is too hard on him—and too forgiving of Rhys. I will never forget what he did in ACOTAR. Yet because the story is filtered through Feyre's perspective, Rhys becomes a hero who makes mistakes and Tamlin becomes a monster who commits unforgivable sins. He genuinely thought the woman he loved had been abducted and was likely being tortured. I'm not excusing his abusive behavior, but we have to remember he was suffering from PTSD too. He was trying to protect Feyre the best he could—just like Rhys by forcing Feyre to make that bargain with him way back in ACOTAR, fyi. Why does Rhys deserve dozens of free passes and not Tamlin?Hating the High Lord of Spring just because Feyre does is a disservice to the complexity of his character.I also like that Maas seems to bepulling away from the whole ""mates"" concept.Multiple characters within have strong romantic relationships without the mating bond, and those that do may not necessarily be right for each other.Much as I love the idea of Lucien and Elain, I get the feeling that she's setting them up for something different. Elain and Azriel, and Lucien and Vassa.The pacing is good, too.There aren't as many sex scenes as the previous book, which I was happy about, though not due to any misguided sense of propriety. I simply found myself bored reading about Rhys slamming his shaft up to the hilt or what not.Still lowkey mad the first thing Feyre did after coming back from the Spring Court is bang Rhys and not check on her traumatized sisters.While I liked them in ACOMAF, there are more important things going on here, like the war or the other courts.Final verdict?

I sniff a reread coming up!Post-Mourning review:And it's the day after I finished this beautiful, exhilarating book. I don't think I'm going to bother writing a review, simply because I wouldn't do it justice. Neither would it showcase how much it means to me. Other than to say that I feel this sense of loss and wonder that I felt when I finished reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. This series has become that ingrained in me.

408,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","I wish so much that I could tell you I loved this book... but I just didn't.After thinkingA Court of Mist and Furywas such a huge improvement fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, I was really excited for this third installment. I even preordered it. But I really struggled to get into the book from the very start. Frompacing issuestoawkward sex scenesthat did nothing for me, it was one disappointment after another.I've said this before but I reallydislike Maas's sex scenes. At her best, she writes them strangely with words like ""branding"" and ""claiming"", but here they were just plain icky. With all the talk of ""mates"", ""growling"" and ""purring"", and the climaxing from stroking one another's wings, I felt like I'd walked in on two animals rutting in the mud. Ugh.And another thing-- Feyre and Rhysand are already mated and loved up to their eyeballs so there wasno sexual tension, no will they/won't they, which made the sex scenes so boring.What's strange about these sex scenes is how they manage to somehow be both graphic and coy at the same time. Maas never actually uses explicit words. If a young kid picked up this book, they might assume Rhysand and Feyre were dancing or playing an instrument.His touch turned different. Exploring. Broad strokes and feather-light ones, arches and swirls and direct, searing lines.And her vagina is usually described as ""there"" or ""where I want him"". Then, at the same time, these scenes are weirdly overwritten, with her orgasm (obviously not called that) leaving her “skin glowing like a newborn star in its wake”. It's just really not my thing.I was disappointed with the writing in general, to be honest. Maas seemed to write a lot more ""tell"" and a lot less ""show"" than usual. I was especially disappointed at the wasted opportunity for some underhanded manipulation in the first part. After how the last book ended, Feyre was kind of ""undercover"" at the start and in a position for lies and sneakiness. Except it was mostly her swanning around and quietly seething to herself about how much she hated Ianthe and how much of a douche Tamlin is.I thought this whole part was boring when it should have been extremely tense and exciting.But I think the worst thing was the overall pacing. It's a long book, but I can normally sprint through Maas's works in a day, yet here it wassuch a slog. Especially the first half. It's taken up with a lot of character conversations and strategizing for the upcoming war with Hybern. It lacked a pull, a sense of urgency, some kind of tension to make me need to know what happens next.I cannot believe they've announced anotherfour booksfor this series. Why??? I can only hope they are some kind of spin-off series because, otherwise, either a) we will have to suffer through who the fuck knows how many more awkward, unsexy Feyre/Rhysand sex scenes, or b) Maas will destroy Rhys's character and hook Feyre up with yet another hot fae dude. I'm not sure which is more likely.The later chapters of this book picked up in pacing, but I think it wastoo little, too late. This is a whopping 700-page monster and it obviously didn't need to be. I will say that I liked how things were left with Tamlin, but seeing as that part was only a few sentences long, it doesn't make up for everything else.I'm thinking this is where I drop out of this series.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube",2

A bottle of wine. “It’s fine if you drink directly from it,” was all Mor said.This book ensared me -body and soul- and the last hundred pages?Whew.Talk aboutstress- like actualheart-pounding stress.For those who don't know me,I stress-bake.I was 18 cupcakes and double-batch of cookies deep by the time I reached that end.

She may do as she wishes.”Feyre, now ruling the Night Court with Rhysand, is about to go to war.King Hybern's army is set to march into the human world - ready toslaughter and enslave.The only chance to save her people is tounite the seven courtsand mount a resistance. Only, the odds could not be more against them.Mile after mile. A kingdom of the rotting dead. And still I looked.Every direction they turn, the King is two steps ahead - alreadybutchering and torturinganyone who stands in his way. His army - limitless, his powers - fueled by the very Cauldron itself.The more Feyre and the Night Court resists, the more likely it seems like they'll lose. Not only the war, but everyone they hold dear.I repeated their names silently, over and over into the darkness. Rhysand. Mor. Cassian. Amren. Azriel. Elain. Nesta.And yet, despite all the pain and the sorrow flowing around them, one thing remains steadfast. One thing remains absolutely certain.I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if this was all the time we were allowed to have … The wait was worth it.Whew. This book was themost stunning of the seriesso far.Sarah J. Maasjuggles so many unique personalities- from the sweetest human to skin-crawling monsters - without them blending into caricatures (Every time, she astounds me with her creations).Herworld has such depththat I'm constantly amazed by the little, reoccurring details (I feel like I could walk the city of Velaris without being lost for a moment).Hercharacters feel real- their personas, their movement, their banter - I felt like they were right in front of me, rather than words on a page (how is it possible to fall in love with so many characters in one book?).I could not be more impressed right now.The 2018 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge - A past Goodreads Choice Awards winnerYouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads",5
410,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","4 StarsBefore I say anything, I must say this:What the fuck is this ""vulgar gesture"" that has been mentioned over andoverand a-FUCKING-over again throughout all this series, which all the characters seem to gift each other with?No for real, I would love to know.Are they all giving each other a different ""vulgar gesture"" every time, or is it ONE single gesture.And if so, which one?This one?This one?How about this one?No?How about the ever tried and true?Or, perhaps, MY personal favorite:No?Well, whatever. I would love to know.Anynotawave, if you follow my reviews, you know that I didn't particularly love book one and two of this series like most people did. And, conversely, most people who adored books one and two seemed to be less...enthused with this book.So, of course, leave it to me to be the complete opposite of everyone else.Because, even though I wasn't OMG inlurvewith books one and two, I found myself really into this one.Maybe it just took books one and two to really dig my heels into the series - who knows - but I was really digging the characters in this one.Obviously, I loved the relationship between Feyre and Rhys...The group love and loyalty of the Night Court inner circle...And the connection between Feyre and her sisters...But - and I know this is not the case with most people - I am REALLY loving Nesta's story.I have been oddly drawn to her and her cold bitchiness since book one and I REALLY loved the growth she displayed in this book, the dynamic between her and Cassian, just everything.And of course, RHYS. Who can not love Rhys?In fact, this book actually made me really appreciate books one and two more.I might go back and read them again.But until then, I am looking forward to the next book in the series.And I also just obtained theThroneseries, so hopefully I will enjoy that one from the onset.",4
411,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","I’m wrecked.Becausea Court of Wings and Ruin was the BEST CONCLUSION I could ever hope for.I want to shoutTHANK YOU SJM for this incredible adventure. Thank you for letting us dream and travel across the stars if only for a short time.I have been a massive fan of the ACOTAR series since the first book so I was highly anticipating ACOWAR.I was afraid I wouldn’t like the third book as much as I loved the second one but hell, I was so wrong. I swear, I don't know how many nerve cells this book cost me.Not only is the book thrilling and well-written. But it added a lot more complexity than I'd expected. Both in the characters and the plot.The progression brings aboutso many new faces(Have five to Helion, my second favourite High Lord), each of them unique in their own way.When Feyre was in the Spring Court, she was so over-powered like she is a goodness and no one can stop her -I was getting some unwanted Aelin’s vibe here– butthe plot was pretty well-driven after that, allowing each character to have its share of glory in Hybern Battle. And thank god for incredible plot twists or else I would have died a thousand times.The other thing that I really enjoyed is the fact thatthe book was unpredictable. I got all emotional becausethe story has a way of being built up and simply torn down piece by piece by a certain event and you are like “What the hell just happened?” and then being rebuilt once again.I literally went mental in one of the last scene – YES, THIS SCENE –my parents were actually concerned because of my change of emotions. I cried during the emotional moments, I got stressed during the battle scenes, I laughed so hard in others, I blushed during the bold sexy scenes, but most of all,I had – and still have believe me - embarrassing fangirling moments over the characters.I have a lot of favourite scenes.Like a lot especially those where a potential couple interact –You should have seen me during NESSIAN SCENES, I was a FANGIRL MONSTER– butone scene particular brought me to tear and that was RHYS’s SPEECH BEFORE the FINAL BATTLE.Overall, it wasan EPIC BOOK closing an AMAZING trilogy with immensely ENTERTAINING STORYLINE, characters TO LOVE and a DETAILED fantasy WORLD.Very much worth your time.What are you waiting for?",5

Was it enjoyable? Sure! I loved jumping back in with my old friends and seeing what was going on, but after a very lengthy intro I found it wasn’t quite what I had hoped for.I won’t rehash everything in detail; there are enough reviews that have already done a much better job than I can, but I feel it’s worth noting them all the same. The tedious pacing, the lack of tension (and lets be honest action as well), along with the awkward, singular attempt at diversity, I just can’t give it more than 3 stars.

416,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","Words fail me. I have always been more of a fan of Sarah J Mass fan, but more towards her Thrown of Glass series. I think this is her best book so far. This book just has everything. Great characters, great story, secrets, betrayal, redemptions, ACTION!!!! You name it, it is here. 700 pages and not a line wasted. Hell, I would have been happy with another 700 pages of this standard. The character are great, but there is such great character development that no one is one dimensional the character are conflicted and complex with their own strengths and issues. Every time I learned something about one of the characters, I wanted to know more. Every character had their moment to shine in this book, and every character in this book could very easily star in their own book. That is the depth of the character in this story. Espicallly Rhysand, and anyone in the Court of Dreams.Since the last book, Feyre has returned to the Spring Court to destroy it from within. This is not Feyre crushed by her truma, suffocated by overprotection, or the powerless girl in a world of monsters/guardians. This is the angry, powerful, deadly calculating woman. I like the fact that Rhysand is every bit her match. I am actually interested to see which of them is the more powerful. So far, with centuries of experience behind battle, tactics, and studies, he seems to be a step ahead, but time will tell. However even with all this going on War is coming to Prythian and with all the High Lords in agreement (with their history of grudges and betrayal this is next to impossible ), they are still way out numbered against the King of Hybern and the power of the Calderon. Once again, it falls to the Court of Dreams to lead the charge not only against their enemies but the very thinking of many Prythians as well.This is just an awesome book. I don't think you have to read the other book in the series to love this book, but I would definitely recommend reading the whole series, but I definitely read this one. The more I read, the more I wanted to read. It took me through every emotion, the anger of betrayal, the pride in overcoming adversity, to the election of victory. I honestly do not think SJM could fit anything more into this many pages. Let's see if she can do 1000 pages of this standard.",5

421,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺“I would not have known what it is to truly hope, even when the world tells you to despair.”Somehow, this book turned out to be very Sarah J. Maas-ish in a way that did not surprise me but still made me terribly emotional. It wasn’t the ACOMAF-emotion, it wasn’t the EoS-emotion, it wasn’t the KoA-emotion, it wasn’t the HoEaB-emotion.This book has had its own emotion, I swear. It was tough, but somehow it was milder than the others previously named.Except for what happened on page 666.I cannot forgive that.I almost had both a heart attack and a stroke at the same time. And I am still not over it and I still feel like SJM pulling shit like this on me is exactly why I might need therapy.After the pure emotion of the previous book in the series,A Court of Wings and Ruinshows the final battle and all its raw and powerful emotions and actions. The dirty and the bad and the ugly – there are all of them there.This battle though is also freedom. No one is above scheming anymore. One must do everything they have in power to win because the cause is holy. There are sacrifices that must be made and plans that must be developed.This battle is also about unity and the book shows us how important this is. When there is a common goal at stake, then pride must be left outside when entering the war-tent. And true masters of war know that. Everyone must work together because victory is in the numbers.Aside from the compelling emotions that charge a book deeply powered by the promise of war, there is another facet of the plot.Thecharactersdiscover alter-egos, personalities that they did not know they had. Or they knew and they tried to reprimand them as hard as possible. Everyone has to overcome their own selves and that is a battle too.“It’s a rare person to face who they truly are and not run from it – not be broken by it.”Every character has their own secret that springs out with the tiniest occasion it gets to have. We see different angles of Cassian and Azriel, of Mor and Amren, of Nesta and Elain, of Tamlin and Lucien. They all fight two battles – of freedom and of self.Rhys and Feyre get to discover and unravel themselves too, but where Feyre finds her vengeful self, her strong and determined essence of a ruler, Rhysand shows us his vulnerable, soft side. The side that determined him to sacrifice himself to keep the ones he loved free.In this book, Rhysand is his ultimate selfless self. And honestly, nothing in this world would make me not love this hell of male.Sarah hit the jackpot with this gem, I’m telling you.If I had to get through absolutely every single emotion this book gave me then I’ll need something stronger than infused water to keep me going, a big cone of chocolate ice cream and probably a re-read of the whole ACOTAR series just to be sure I get everything right.I love how cunning and ruthless does SJM get when writing her books and even though sometimes there is no need for something like this, ACOWAR had to benefit from that. How else could such a mesmerising story end but in tears of frustration and raw feelings, I’m asking you?I honestly fell so hard for this series it became one of the things I think I’ll love in my life forever and ever. Glad I could read it and right now, writing this sorry of a review, I am considering so hard re-reading all of the books because damn, this helps my mental health in so many weird ways I can’t even seem to understand it myself.If you haven’t read the beauty of the ACOTAR series, please just go for it. Your life will be complete and you’ll probably thank me later ;)“Maybe one day, when the earth had grown old and died, when the stars had vanished, too…maybe then, we would return to this place.”",5

423,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","4.25/5 stars""Remember that you are a wolf. And you cannot be caged.""I want to print off a picture of this cover and keep it in my wallet. Just in case anyone asks me if I have children, I can just show them this.Because all these assholes are my children.I don’t even know where to start with this review. I’ve been writing things and then deleting them for weeks. Every combination of words just isn’t therightcombination I need to right the perfect review.Sarah J. Maasalways releases not one, but two gigantic books a year and I don’t even know how to write a thousand word review? Actual proof that SJM is a writing goddess. We have been blessed from the heavens.So anyways, I've decided to write whatever the hell comes to my head. So this entire review is one huge train wreck. It's an unorganized mess. I'm gonna apologize for that right now. It also contains unmarked spoilers because it is almost three thousand words long and I don't have time to go through and mark every single spoiler.ACOWAR had the unfortunate luck of having to proceed the epicness that was A Court of Mist and Fury. It’s like being given $1,000,000, spending it all, then being given only a $100,000. Both amounts of money are nice to have, but obviously the million is the better option. Or like watching Beyonce perform live in concert, then having to watch a youtube video of Beyonce. Both are nice, great options, but there is always going to be the preferable one. I actually feel sorry for ACOWAR. It didn’t deserve to be a follow-up toA Court of Mist and Fury, but it really didn’t have an option. ACOWAR is better than ,A Court of Thorns and Rosesbut if you were to look up the definition of “prefection” in the dictionary, there will be a picture of the ACOMAF cover.Let me just get some of my thoughts & feels written down real quick. Beware, some might be spoilery. Please proceed with caution.A COURT OF THOUGHTS & FEELS1. Rhys is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him2. Feyre is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her3. Mor is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her4. Lucien is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him5. Amren is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her6. Azriel is actually the best fictional character even and I love him7. Cassian is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him8. Tamlin is actually the worst fictional character ever and I hate him9. I hate him so much10. Seriously11. Who okay’d Tamlin as a character?12. They should be fired13. Ianthe sucks too14.I’m glad that bitch got destoryed by the weaver15. We could have done without the sex scenes though.16. Remember when they were in the library? And all they wanted to do was have sex and not read. Talk about unrealistic.17. Rhys is the most dramatic character in YA…...pass it on18. The beginning, when Feyre was at the Spring Court, was actually my favorite part of the entire book? I loved it.19. I was just like yaaas Feyre girl you destroy those losers20. Also when Feyre and Rhys were reunited that was cool21. I wanted that scene to be longer though with a lot less sex22.Also the Suriel’s death was not okay’d by me and Sarah will be hearing from my lawyers23. Also who approved the term “vulgar gesture???” They should be fired too.24. Also if I ever hear the word ""mate"" again I'm gonna spontaneous combust25. Cassian + Feyre = A friendship you will never have26. Mor is gay and all is okay27.Also no one in the night squad died which is really unrealistic to me? Also kinda disappointing. I was preparing myself for a death that never came, which took time away from me preparing my funeral.28. Also Amren is the best thing to come out of this book29. If the sequels aren’t about her I’m sueing.30. Also does anyone know why we were fighting this war? I don't remember.31. And also does anyone remember how the high lord powers work and why they all happen to be the most powerful people their courts but they get their position through genetics? Because if I haven't learned anything from YA literature, at least I've learned that there will always be a chosen one who's more powerful than any ruler. So why hasn't that happened?CHARACTERS! cHARACTERSFeyre.Feyre is the best? She has evolved so much since the first book. And she's so loyal to those she loves. But if she hates you, you are dead. There is no way to save you.Rhys.I don't know if you knew this, but in certain countries it's agaisnt the law to hate Rhys. He's the best.Tamlin.Remember that time when you used to like Tamlin? Hahahaha he's an asshole.Mor.She's gay! Which is also the only diversity we got in this book.But she's the best.Amren.I want to be her when I grow up. She's the best.Lucien.I am just so glad that Lucien found God in this book.Cassian.I just love Cassian? I just want him to wrap me up in his wings. He's the best.Azriel.I would leave my boyfriend Kaz for Azriel. He's the best.SUMMARY AND COMMENTARYI’m going to do something I never done before in a review. There are so many scenes that I just want to talk about, that I’m gonna summarize a lot of this book so I can talk about them. This entire thing is spoilery so please don't read unless you've read the book.So we start off athellthe Spring Court and Tamlin is being is douchebag self like always. He’s just hanging around, doing his meninist things. Not realizing that Miss High Lady of the Night Court over there is slowly taking down his court.A nightmare, I’d told Tamlin.Iwas the nightmare.I was kinda hoping for more telepathic interactions? I wanted Feyre to say something like, “Oh Rhys was just terrible to me.” and Rhys to just pop up and be like, “Terribly good in bed.” or something like that. But that never happened. SJM really threw away her shot.Hamilton would be disappointed.I’m going to be honest here. I didn’t really understand how Feyre took down the Spring Court? Like I know she did it by gaining the people’s trust. But I didn’t understand that sunlight scene or all the uneventful trips to the wall. Also Ianthe didn’t die in the first part which was disappointing. BUT IANTHE DOES GET HER HAND SMASHED INTO LITTLE PIECES BY FEYRE WHICH IS SO FREAKING BRUTAL I screamed the entire time like wow I don’t like the bitch either but did she really deserve to have her hand continuously smashed? I am a good person who has morals and part of me is still like “yeah she deserved that”Anyways Feyre is eventually like #byelosers @ the Spring Court and leaves. She takes Lucien with her which is really cool because Lucien deserved better than those assholes. So Lucien and Feyre flee the Spring Court, which at this point is burning.In fact I have an actual, never before seen picture of the spring court taken shortly after Feyre leftSome stuff happens and there's fighting because it’s a high fantasy novel and not having any fighting would probably make it a contemporary or something. But anyhow, Cassian eventually comes and helps Feyre and Lucien with the fighting. And the Cassian/Feyre reunion is the best reunion in this book? Like what Feyre/Rhys reunion?I met those laughing, fierce hazel eyes.Cassian’s smile softened. “Hello, Feyre.""My throat tightened to the point of pain, and I threw my arms around his neck, embracing him tightly.“I missed you, too,” Cassian murmured, squeezing me.Honestly, that scene was the absolute best? Like after that, the Feysand reunion was so underwhelming. It happened just a few pages later but it wasn’t cute dialogue and hugs and ***friendship*** Their meetup was crying on the floor then having unnecessary explicit sex.SJM is great and all, but her sex scenes are the worst. I understand that sex is a thing that exist and Feysand participates in it, but I just don’t care about the details. I would rather have more Amren dialogue.So at one point during all this reunion sex, Feyre tells Rhys that he likes a dramatic entrance which has just won an oscar for “understatement of the year”. Because obviously, Rhys did not crash Feyre’s wedding in ACOMAFThe next part of the book is just like plotting and stuff. It’s kind of boring. I honestly almost fell asleep during the next two hundred pages? I mean I didn’t though because this is a SJM book but I could have. There was no action. No suspense. At least I had Amren and her I-don’t-give-a-shit attitude to keep me awake.There is the library scene which is the worst scene in the entire book. So Feyre and Rhys are in this gigantic ass library surrounded by books which is like life goals right? If you don’t want to be surrounded by books then gtfo of my review. But anyways, instead of appreciating the luxuries they have in their life, Feyre and Rhys spend the entire time flirting with each other? This annoyed me so much. It was the most unrealistic scene in this entire series. I don’t care if my High Lord mate was there with me. If I was in a library surrounded by books, then he doesn’t freaking exist in that moment.Also there is a giant monster thing that lives in the basement of this library that everyone is afraid of? #goals“If you hadn’t stolen my bride away in the night, Rhysand, I would not have been forced to take such drastic measures to get her back.”I said quietly, “The sun was shining when I left you.”So Rhys and Feyre and the rest of the squad decided to throw a party. By party I mean, they decided to get all the incredibly powerful, opinionated fae in one place and try to come to an agreement. This is such a smart idea. Just wow. They also invite Tamlin to be nice and then they act surprised when he shows up??? Like you guys sent him an invite to your birthday party??? It would be rude of him not to come???? Why would he turn down free cake like that?!?!?!Tarquin took him in. Then me. And the others. “I rescind the blood rubies. Let there be no debts between us.”“Don’t expect Amren to return hers,” Cassian muttered. “She’s grown attached to it.”So the greatest thing ever happened during this meeting? And I’m not talking about when Feyre destroyed Tamlin when he was being a prick. No, I’m talking about how Amren isn’t returning her ruby that marks her for death? She’s so iconic. I want to be Amren when I grow up.Then, while all these high lords were in the same place and wasting time fighting with each other,donald trumpthe King ofHybitchHyburn brings down the wall that they were all tryingnot sodesperately to protect. And again, they were all surprised.Like are you fUCKing kidding me? How did you not see this coming???? You are standing around, doing pratically nothing. Wasting all the time in the world. AND YO UARE SUPRISED THAT HYBITCH IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH HIS PLANS. YOU KNOW HE WAS TRYING TO BRING THAT WALL DOWN. he WAS GONNA DO IT AND YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS THE PERFECT OPPURTUNITY. Honestly, I am surprised he didn’t succeed earlier than this?So noW that the wall has been destroyed and is never coming back, all these high lords realized that if they are going to win this war, they are gonna all get off their asses to do something.Also what even are we fighting for? All I know about this war is that the King of Hyburn is bad and the Night Court Squad is good. How did this war even start? What did Amarantha have to do with anything? Who even is Myriam person and what does she have to do with anything? I know it was probably explained in ACOMAF but that was a year ago and I was too busy placing my attention on Rhys to pay any attention. So at this point I’m 469 pages into the last book of this trilogy and I don’t even know what we are fighting for? I’m emotionally invested in a war I know nothing about. Is this what politics are like?Anyways, the squad and their newly found high lord allies go to take down Hybitch.So then Feyre has this brilliant idea to go find out good friend the Suriel. I forgot the Suriel even existed tbh. He’s so creepy that I am sure my brain purposely block him out from my ACOTAR memories. So we go find Mr. Suriel and he is near the Weaver’s cottage.I also blocked the weaver out from my memories so, if you are like me, this is when you bust open your ACOTAR coloring book, flip to the picture of the Weaver, and then pretend to remember.So the Suriel is kinda helpful but unhelpful as always. But Feyre still cares about him becasue why would’t you care about the creepy monster that doesn’t even have a proper name and you've only met like three times? So Suriel, that unhelpful yoda, is in the middle of giving Feyre vague advice when THAT BITCH IANTHE SHOWS UP AND JUST SHOOTS HIM WITH AN ARROW FOR NO GOOD REASON. Obviously having a crushed hand hasn’t affected her aim any.Someone should just kill that bitch already. Which is exactly what Feyre does. And she isn’t even easy on her. She takes Ianthe into the Weaver’s cottage and the weaver like eats her. Gross. I would have atleast chosen a less graphic demise. And something that kills her a lot longer.How fortunate are we that we caught the impossible-to-catch Suriel for the third time right near the cottage of a monster thing that likes to eat bitches? We are soooo fortunate.“Feyre Archeron,” the Suriel said again, gazing at the leafy canopy, the sky peeking through it. A painful inhale. “A request.”I leaned close. “Anything.”Another rattling breath. “Leave this world...a better place than how you found it.”So after murdering Ianthe, Feyre goes back to the dying Suriel and I haveThe Hunger Gamesflashbacks to Rue’s death scene. I was kind of expecting Feyre to gather flowers to place around the Suriel. And obviously, even though we are in a world surrounded by magic, there is no way to save the Suriel. He dies. I’m devastated. You are devastated. I still vaguely remember the Suriel from the past two books.And if I’m honest, this all could have been avoided if Feyre wasn’t so dramatic and just asked the Suriel to coffee or something.Oh also, I just happened to have stumbled upon this picture of Feyre that was taken one time after someone was shocked she caught the SurielMore stuff I don’t care about happens blah blah blah and then Feyre’s sister, Elain, is somehow kidnapped by the cauldron.Also making a cauldron the most powerful object in all the universe is the stupidest thing I’ve ever read.How did the Cauldron kidnap Elain? I don’t know it is never really explained how that inanimate object does anything. Remember, I still don’t know why the crap we are at war here. Anyways, Feyre gets really upset so she goes undercover as Ianthe and infiltrates the Hyburn army and saves Elain. Feyre goes through maybe one obstacle along the way and then returns to her mate Rhys.Also, if you are a person who participates in drinking games, then here’s a fun one for you while you read the book. Every time the word “mate” is said you drink. And get drunk during the first chapter. You'll be in the hospital by the third chapter. So actually don’t play that drinking game.And was I the only person who felt this entire thing was so unneeded? This is a 700 page book and we are nearing the end and now we are going on missions that run a little too smoothly? Like I know Azriel gets hurt but he’ll heal perfectly fine because we live in a world of healing magic that works on bat wings but not bitch’s hands.More fighting. There is a lot of fighting that happens. It’s like they are at war or something.Oh remember Feyre’s father? Yeah, I don’t either. But he comes back. I didn’t know he was gone but he came back with ships named after his daughters and Odette fromSwan Lakebut instead of a Swan, she’s a firebird which might just be a stupid name for a phoenix, oh and he name isn’t Odette. Anyways, her father finds this queen they just happened to be looking for even though there’s no way he could have possibly known that because he has been missing for 37297843 years. So obviously, because of this all his past sins are forgiven instantly. Then her father eventually dies because ofTrumpHybitch and we are suppose to be sad about it but I’m still standing here likeThen, on page 666, because Sarah is in fact the devil, the unthinkable happens. MY BABY RHYS WHO IS SUPPOSE TO BE PROTECTED AT ALL TIMES DIES. YES DIES. AND AT THIS POINT I’M CRYING IN THE CORNER AND WANTING TO THROW THE BOOOK INTO A VOLCANOAnd I’m just like, “If he ficking stays dead then at least all 700 pages of this book will make great kindling to warm my now cold heart”But then I remember ACOTAR and how Feyre here died and then was brought back to life so I start looking at the other high lords who happen to be near us at this moment and I’m just “Hey do a girl a favor here AND BRING BACK MY BOYFRIEND.”But then I also remember there’s a certain asshole who is also a high lord who has to help and I Start FREAKING out but then he comes through and he’s just like “Be happy, Feyre,” and SAVES RHY’S LIFEYou still an asshole Tam, but maybe just a little bit less.ANd I’m just crying in the corner even harder than before.Then somehow they defeat the King of Hybitch and Feyre and Rhys live happily ever after. Both are alive. The #NightSquad is still alive. Beause that is super realistic.Looks like the only person who is dead here is me. Oh well.CONCLUSIONSo while ACOMAF is still the best, this is still a great novel and I loved it? Being with all my children again is all I have ever asked for in life and I 'm just glad that they all ended up happy.",4
424,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Only you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.”Let me talk to you about this book. This bookKILLED ME. This bookDESTROYED ME. This bookANNIHILATED ME. This bookOBLITERATED ME. This bookELIMINATED ME. This bookWIPED ME OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. This bookEXTERMINATED ME. This bookERADICATED ME. I will never recover. How can I function after this fucking book? I was supposed to read it slowly becauseA Court of Frost and Starlightwill arrive here after a week and I have had serious issues waiting for those books in the past, but I couldn't stop. The last 300 pages were marvelous, they gripped me by the balls and took me with them on this amazing journey. I was reading till6amyesterday. No regrets. The feels are always heightened this ungodly time of day. And I'm so happy I read this book at that time. But let's start from the very beginning.Looming war threatens all Feyre holds dear in the third volume of the #1 New York Times bestselling A Court of Thorns and Roses series.Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin's manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit – and one slip may spell doom not only for Feyre, but for her world as well.As war bears down upon them all, Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords – and hunt for allies in unexpected places.This book started off strong enough. I was extremely excited about Feyre infiltrating Tamlin's Court and taking him down. She would be such a badass. I expected this part of the book to be bigger, to be honest. About 250 pages, to be exact. I really enjoyed the scheming, the planning, the cleverness of Feyre, how she turned everyone against one another so brilliantly. I hated Tamlin and Ianthe more in this part of the book, obviously. They were both manipulative, controlling and toxic. They truly deserved each other. Lucien gained some respect from me in this part of the book. I was really disappointed in him inA Court of Mist and Fury.Afterwards, the pace of the book gets a bit slower than I would have wanted. I expected it to happen, because the ""format"" of these books is always the same, for me at least. A very powerful beginning, then the pace lags a little bit and in the end the trueBAM! But it was different for me in this book. I didn't feel the same excitement its predecessor gave me (till page 400). And I understand why. The previous book opened up a whole entire different world to me. From the Spring Court and everything we thought we knew was right, everything changed. And we start off getting to know everything in the Night Court, and it was all exhilarating. As much and even more as it was getting to know the entire world of everything in the first book. Getting to know Rhysand and his true incentives, the inner circle, the world, seeing the romance bloom between Rhysand and Feyre. In this book, everything is settled. We know everyone, the world, the romance is stable. There aren't as many new things happening, except when we get to page 400. Till this page, I would have given this book 4 stars, which is low for this series for me, because I LIVE FOR IT.I'm going to talk a bit about the first 400 pages, before my favorite part of the book starts. After Feyre arrived in the Night Court with Lucien, everything took a certain pace. We got to feel Velaris again, the inner circle, Rhysand, the conflict, the problems. A gargantuan War is coming, and they had to deal with it. Gather allies, forge a plan, make actions, bargains. This entire chunk of the book was about the war and how they would end it. And I truly enjoyed that but it didn't keep me on my toes, you know? Till page 400.PAGE 400. THAT'S WHERE THE REAL SHIT STARTS. And then we got to page 400. When the meeting starts. This is the part I couldn't leave the book down. The part where if anyone commanded me to leave the book down, I would have killed them. Like fucking Feyre would. This meeting was so enthralling. The tension was keeping me enraptured the entire time. I'm content that we got to know the other High Lords of Prythian, we got a better understand of the world and its people. They were all truly incredible characters (except Beron), especially Helion. I loved his humor, his swag and that he's bisexual. I noticed something very important in this book. There was more representation. Not enough but more. We got to see black characters, bisexual characters, gay characters, lesbian characters (MOR I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU GIRL). This series isn't known for its diversity, but it was nice to see some more examples popping up. It was refreshing.But anyway, let's continue with the meeting. I was so proud of all my Night Court babies, how they handled it. Each question a challenge that was met brilliantly.IF I COULD I WOULD STAND UP AND APPLAUD AZRIEL FOR ATTACKING ERIS. FUCKING ERIS.And also my Queen Feyre, who showed her true powers without fear of the High Lords. Of so many High Lords, who could easily kill her. And then Tamlin enters the Dawn Court room. I thought there was a limit to how much I hated him, but he surpassed that. His crude, distasteful and inappropriate comments were so unnecessary. Dude, we know how fucking butthurt you are that your girlfriend left you for a better man than you, but we're here to discuss how to prevent the War, your comments are fucking irrelevant. Be a better man for once and show some restraint. Now wonder even Lucien left you. Lucien. Oh man. Helion is Lucien's father. I was so fucking astonished. This book bestowed many plot twists for us, and this was one that gripped me tightly. I don't even know the reason, I just really like Lucien all of a sudden. More than I liked him in the first book. And I genuinely appreciated how he trusted Feyre, and how he acclimated himself to the Night Court. How he saw good in Rhysand and his people, after all the propaganda of the latest hundreds of years. How he wanted to be useful and help do something significant for the War.I WANT TO DISCUSS HOW FEYRE IS SUCH A SHIPPER, IT HURTS. Feyre is like us. She ships her friends with each other and tries to make the ship happen. I'm so proud of her. I'm so proud that she actively participates in her friend's happiness. She ships everything I ship, and I couldn't not notice it, it's so obvious. I want her to succeed. I want her to find the best fucking girlfriend for Mor, cause my girl deserves happiness. They all deserve it, but her more, in the relationship factor. I'm very sorrowful that in this world, a lesbian woman can't thrive. It mirrors our own world, to be exact. Some people have the resources and the family behind to support them, and some people just, don't. Mor has been so unlucky in the romance department, with her cruel family stopping everything that she does. I want her to come out, and I want Feyre to be beside her and support her.I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NESTA AND CASSIAN. NESTA AND CASSIAN. The ship I was rooting for since the previous book. The ship that is killing my heart slowly and painfully.THEY HAVE TO BE MATES. PLEASE TELL ME THEY'RE MATES. And even if they're not, their dynamic is so strong. Their scenes so utterly powerful, even them staring at each other had me dying in my seat. I want them to thrive. They are my favorite couple, after Rhysand and Feyre, and I want them to prosper. There was such a gradual progress with them. Sarah handled this couple's dynamic amazingly. How we started seeing, little by little, how Nesta started caring more about Cassian. How gentle he was with her, with her feelings. He didn't push her, he didn't drive her to the edge. I want more of them, I want them to take over the world. Nesta is such a favorite character of mine. Strong, unyielding, snarky, flawed, raw, true. She is perfectly flawed, the way I like my characters to be. This book series doesn't favor flawed characters. Most of them are impeccable, outside and inside. But Nesta isn't. She still shows her humanity and I love her for it.We talked about Nesta... now we have to talk about Elain. Useless, needless Elain. I didn't like her in this book. I loathed her moping around, her extremely extravagant sensitivity, her outmost obsolescence. I couldn't stand everyone defending and protecting her, all the fucking time. Oh poor little Elain, how bad must it be for you to be immortal, young and beautiful forever, aw I feel so sorry for you. She didsomethingin the end by stabbing The Hybern King, but not something miraculous. Nesta integrated the action. I just didn't enjoy her character in this book, she was utterly annoying to me.This War man... this War. It was the most tit gripping thing I have read in a very long time. The adrenaline was high up in heaven. It was jaw dropping, breathtaking, awe-inspiring. When the hope was lost, there would be hope, and when there was hope, it would be taken harshly out of our grip. There was so much shit happening, so many characters appearing, to help, to condemn. Strategies being thrown our the window, plans succeeding, failing, bargains breaking. There was just.. so much happening. I couldn't keep track of everything. The action was astounding, the plot twists out of this world, the thrill spectacular. I devoured these chapters in a heartbeat. I wasn't even looking at the pages or chapters, or even time, I was just reading. This book was a true and amazing ending to an incredible series. I'm so happy I picked these books up. This series made me love fantasy again. I have stopped being a fan of fantasy for many many years, and these books reintroduced me to its virtues.I WANT TO READ MORE FANTASY BECAUSE OF THESE BOOKS YEAH.RHYS'S DEATH GUYS. It happened in page666, how convenient. I didn't feel a heartbeat for a minute. I know he would survive because he's in the next book, but you know how it is. I was utterly heartbroken by Feyre's reaction. She made me feel what she was feeling. I cried. Literally. And hear me out a bit. This is a huge deal for me. I never cry with books. The only books I have ever cried about are theHarry Potterseries and theOutlanderseries. Which are my all time favorite books of all the fucking universe. When I started crying, I was so surprised at myself. I was so happy I did. Because Rhys has become one of my all time favorite characters, and seeing his demise broke me. Like Feyre's heart was broken. And then Tamlin gives his last speck of light and saves him. Let's talk about him and his redemption arc.You have seen my feelings about him in the fist part of this review. In the end, they shifted, just a bit. I truly appreciated how he helped Feyre, how he saved her. And how he saved Rhysand's life. I don't like him, but I value how he got over his grudge, and actually helped everyone, for the good of Prythian. I forgive you, Tamlin, you're still a piece of shit of a character with many unsolved issues, but as Feyre said“I hope you find happiness, too.'""And I did. Not just for what he'd done for Rhys, but...Even for an immortal, there was not enough *time* in life to waste it on hatred. On feeling it and putting it into the world.So I wished him well -- I truly did, and hoped that one day...One day, perhaps he would face those insidious fears, that destructive rage rotting away inside him.”You get a pass, bitch. I'm curious of what will happen to his relationship with Lucien. It will be interesting.I have written 12000 words for this review. And 8000 are left. I will surpass Goodread's character limit. Lmao. I had so much to say about this book, the ending of a marvelous series. I couldn't help myself and I'm very sorry for this chaos of a review. My feels are still raw and unedited. And if you're reading this right now, you're a true hero for going through all of this shittone. And I love you for it.To sum it all up, this book was a truly magnificent journey and an incredible ending to a wonderful series. I'm literally speechless, and I will think about this book a lot. For a very long time. Nothing else more I can say, this review explains it all. I will crawl now to my bed and die peacefully of the feels. And till the next one... K BYE!7500 characters left out of 20000.LMFAO.",5

It picked up right where the second book left off and I felt like I was reading one long book. I guess I just described what a series is actually. The last battle scene almost had me checking into the nearest psych ward. Really curious to see how Nesta and Elain’s characters develop. Onward.,5
428,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","A Court of Wings and Ruinis the third book in the ACOTAR series by Sarah J. Maas, and it's wild. The book starts with Feyre spying on the Spring Court for Rhys, pretending to be Tamlin's faithful wife again so she can undermine his Court from the inside.I absolutely adored the first part of the book. I love how clever Feyre was, setting up the destruction of the Spring Court while no one knew what she was planning. The way she tricked Tamlin was gold.After she returns to the Night Court, war breaks out between Hybern and Prythian. She goes on a quest to find the Cauldron, an ancient source of magic that might just stop the war. But not all of the Courts are willing to help her, and she will have to call on other magical creatures and forces to aid her in her search.I didn't like this part of the book as much. It felt very aimless to me, and drawn out for so long that the plot points lost all meaning. I wasn't bored, exactly, but the plot just feltwrongto me, as if something were missing. It was pretty straightforward in the beginning—find the Cauldron, destroy Hybern—but then a bunch of subplots were introduced. Feyre had to make deals with spirits and gods, she had to avoid Hybern—it was just... a lot, and yet too little at the same time. What do I mean by ""too little?"" Well...The pacing was dreadful. That doesn't mean I was bored.The plot built up far too quickly. Unlike inThrone of Glass,where the plot built gradually and climaxed in KoA, the plot here came out of nowhere. The villain, the King of Hybern, was so one-dimensional and uninteresting. His motives didn't make sense, the little history that was thrown in was so random and didn't help make him a better character at all, and his death was so unsatisfying. The character who killed him... well, I'm not going to spoil it, but I don't think they were the right character to do the job. See the spoilery section for more on that.This series would have been better as just a regular romance, without all this...plot.I only really cared about the Inner Circle anyway. If it were just a faerie romance with great side characters and a found family, I would. Not. Care. That's all I want. Adding a whole epic plotline to the story just drags it down. I much preferred the more introspective ACOMAF.I really, really loved Feyre in ACOMAF, and now? Not so much. She has too many powers. She can do everything the High Lords can and more. I love how she's the first High Lady, but honestly, she has every power and it gets annoying when she can do basically anything.However, there are still times when I like Feyre more than Aelin. She's more mild and less overbearing, and I like that in a protagonist. She's persistent when she needs to be, and determined to learn. She understands the meaning of responsibility.Rhys before the mating bond is superior to Rhys after the mating bond. For one, he was less protective in the beginning of ACOMAF versus ACOWAR. I'm tired of overprotective, aggressive male characters. I miss the Rhysand of ACOMAF, the one with a sharp sense of humor and patient respect for Feyre. He still has some of the traits he exhibited earlier, but they're dimmed in the face of his overpoweringmaleness that can sometimes turn into toxic masculinity. Thank you, next.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS AHEAD, PROCEED WITH CAUTION🚨🚨🚨Elain killed the King of Hybern and I am angry.She's incapable of doing anything useful and everyone, including the other characters, consistently forgets she exists. How am I supposed to believe she sneaked up behind the big baddie and stabbed him? How is she the hero here? Okay, maybe this is her big moment, when she overcomes her fear and does something awesome, but... where's the buildup?I have a theory that NoBrain Elain is actually whip-smart and pretends to be meek and helpless just to manipulate everyone around her. And I have evidence.1. One of Elain's only lines of dialogue is, ""I hope they all burn in hell."" And everyone is shocked because she likes gardens and flowers and she hardly ever talks so they all think she's weak. But what if this is just Elain's true side showing through?2. She holds all of the characters in the palm of her hand. Nesta is obsessed with protecting her. Azriel is in love with her. Feyre will do anything to save her when she gets captured, and so Rhys likes her too just because Feyre does. They risked all of their lives just to sneak into Hybern's camp and save her, despite the fact that she has done nothing useful this entire book. What if she's manipulating them all, using them for her own gain?That's my wild theory. Have fun with it.At the end of the book, Amren sacrifices herself to destroy Hybern. This had the potential to be a really powerful, touching moment. But no. She got brought back from the dead because no one EVER dies in fantasy books. And this makes me mad. Her sacrifice lost all of its pain because there were literally no consequences.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨🚨🚨NoBrain ElainWritten by SofiaNoBrain Elain puts me in painHer stupid shenanigans make me mad againShe's a pointless character who does nothingBut add to my unending sufferingShe never talks, but everyone loves herMaybe it's trauma, but I still sufferShe gets into trouble and everyone criesI just smile and hope she diesShe belongs with Tamlin, that much is trueIf she ends with Azriel, I will sueNesta may be angering, but at least she's not thisI would banish Elain from this earth with my last wishElain, ElainNoBrain ElainNobody cares about your painThis may sound harsh, but rest assuredThe whole book community thinks you're absurd3.5 starsACOTAR reviewACOMAF reviewcredit",3
429,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","H.O.L.Y. -Just when I thought that a book couldn't be honed to absolute perfection,Sarah J. Maaswiped that sneer off my face and proved me wrong. Again.A Court of Wings and Ruinis a work of art that will make you run out of proper adjectives to describe all the pandemonium, magic and apocalypse it entails. The kind that will pull at your heartstrings right from the get-go and hold you with its sharp claws, imploring you to devour it.Intense action, delicious romance, backstabbing, ferociously deadly creatures, raw brutality, lies and disguise are all ornately woven into a tale that will cocoon you into the Fae world and soothe you, leaving you anchored by nothing but a tempest in your lungs.There was darkness and light, storm and calm, despair but also hope. You will see battles mired with savagery and viciousness, harsh and regrettable decisions and nerve-wracking adventures in a world where humans are perceived as weak and easily destroyable.Sarah J. Maas's world building is so exquisite that I felt detached from my own body, incapable of focusing on anything else happening around me, only flipping the pages with an acute yearning of what's about to happen. She delivers plenty of magic and mayhem, with a knack for perfect pacing of the story and character reflection.CharactersThe Inner Circle, my favourite squad ❤I love their devotion to each other. Their ability to be kind in spite of harsh circumstances, their ability to love despite enduring a millenia of cruelty. They're all so full of light, it makes we want to smile and simultaneously tear up at their unconditional loyalty. I was so attached to them, like I was bound to them by an invisible, irrevocable tether. When they struggled, I struggled. When they were hurt, I was hurt. I could feel their rage, loyalty and honour coursing through my veins, like a shrieking void.High LordsI don't think I would have enjoyed this book at all if not for them. I'm glad thatSarah J. Maasshowed them in a new light, something readers haven't seen in the previous books.As amusing as their banter was, I also feel deeply moved by their actions, their unwavering faith in one another during the battle despite their iffy past.Be itHelion,the Spell Cleaver;Thesan,the healer;Tarquin,the sympathetic and thoughtful leader;Kallias,the snow/ice manipulator andBeron,..... Never mind, I didn't really like him; I loved them with every echoing heartbeat. (Beron being the exception)‎Oh andTamlin. I apologise if I've been harsh to him after readingA Court of Mist and Fury, but I have a new found respect for him. Despite his impropriety initially, the fact that he finally rises to be a better man by not dwelling on petty vengeance and retribution hit me in the gut and made my eyes burn with warm tears.WhereA Court of Mist and Furywas romance heavy (not that I'm complaining),A Court of Wings and Ruinwas action-packed and was cluttered with twists and magical intrigue and SJM definitely didn't let the romance aspect of the book obliterate the subplot, deftly exploring all the details.I feel weighed down by the intensity of this composition and I vow never to let it slip even from the deepest clutches of my mind ❤",5
430,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)",I think this might be my favorite book in the series so far! I loved the romance plot in the second book but I LOVED the politics in this book. I found it so interesting. I wasn’t bored for a second in this book,5
431,"A Court of Wings and Ruin (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3)","“Be happy, Feyre,” he said quietly.Actually it's not a 5-star rating, more like 4.5678-star for me. But this book, this blessed book brought me to tears and my heart nearly exploded through it.RHYS.I breathe him in and don't want to let him out. I longed for ACOWAR since it didn't even have the title and promised myself that I couldn't die before I got my hands on it. I can't gather the words to express how I am feeling right now. Everything is just right. EPIC. PERFECT. EXQUISITE.RHYSI loved him with every bit of my heart. And Feyre, her development shocked me. As you know, she's High Lady of the Night Court, and when I was certain that her pesona couldn't get any better from ACOMAF, I was wrong because she slays and slays and slays. I even saw Aelin in Feyre when she leads her people and makes a vital decision at the end. Don't do that to me ever again, Feyre !Tamlin. I don't hate him at all. I always see him as an ordinary human. He raged. He blamed the others. He made wrong decisions. But eventually, he is what he is. In this book, I can see the reason why Feyre hasn't been his match. Tamlin loves her. Rhysand loves her. A huge difference between these guys is how they treat her, while Tamlin treated Feyre like she's made of glass, Rhys forged her into a weapon she was born to be. And Tamlin has done everything wrong from the moment he lost her. Although he declared that it came from his love, I saw a fine line between love and possession. They're not the same.“I see all of you, Rhys. And there is not one part that I do not love with everything that I am.”Cassian, Mor, Azriel, Nesta, Elian, and Amren are the best supporting characters ever. They stand out and have their important roles to play. Cassian is reckless. Mor is easy-going but her heart... Azriel is complicated. Nesta is virile, she has proved herself so much in this book. Elian. Sweet Elian is literally multilayered characters. If Nesta was fire, Elian would be an ember set to burn hotter than fire.SJM pulled off every piece of the story amazingly. The twists are subtle and profound. High Lords are all intruging and different from one another. I felt the changes through the three parts of this book. The first part and the third are the best, IMO, I loved the first ten chapters the most where Feyre is at the Spring Court. Everything she's done are so appeased.“Because I can’t stay away.”I listened to many songs while I was reading this book, though. One of my favorites ishttps://youtu.be/tgvbhxb9yk8It healed my soul whenever something happened and I couldn't prevent myself from crying over for the pain I felt.Though ACOWAR is not the best of the series (I think the best is ACOMAF as it's so emotional and deep), I still liked the most of it, especially the war and strategies these characters manage to plan out.The killing blow was shocking I nearly fell off of the chair. And when Rhys is dead my world was completely shattered.Moreover, ACOWAR is the longest book of the series but SJM somehow wrote and wove every part of the details into the whole perfect picture immaculately. She's a queen of expanding her books and universe yet she can control her stories not to spin out of control.“Leave this world … a better place than how you found it.”I loved this series because of the world-building and romance of the characters. The concept of the Wall dividing two worlds is interesting and the ending is real and what it's supposed to be from the beginning. I'm so glad to know and read this series. It never fails me, never one.FEYRE FOR LIFE. TAMLIN FOR NOW.RHYS FOR FOREVER.“You belong to all of us, and we belong to you.”My favorites : 1) ACOMAF 2) ACOWAR 3) ACOTARNote :Why didn't I give ACOWAR 5 stars ? Why 4.5678 ? Ummmmm, I know the big part of me enjoyed this book wholeheartedly regarding this is the end to this arc (there're more books to come, though) and the most anticipated of this year. But the small part of me felt some things in ACOWAR were too coincidental and easy. Yet SJM ended this thoroughly, and I can't wait to see her finish the ToG series in 2018.Buddy read withLaurieandMaddieBloghttps://goo.gl/aVlsE6",5

Yeah, this was 𝗡𝗢𝗧 that.This book was EVERYTHING. I MEAN 𝑬𝑽𝑬𝑹𝒀𝑻𝑯𝑰𝑵𝑮.I’ve highlighted so much. WAY TOO MUCH 🙆‍♀️I read this so slowly because I knew when it would be over I’d be a wreck. 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗜𝗧 𝗛𝗔𝗦 𝗥𝗨𝗜𝗡𝗘𝗗 𝗠𝗘 𝗙𝗢𝗥 𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝗥𝗢𝗠𝗔𝗡𝗖𝗘 𝗕𝗢𝗢𝗞𝗦. My standards are too high now. 🤠The writing was 𝘐𝘔𝘔𝘈𝘊𝘜𝘓𝘈𝘛𝘌． I can go on and on about how beautifully written this masterpiece was. The diversity in this book was amazing to see!There was not a 𝗦𝗜𝗡𝗚𝗟𝗘 dry page. Not one. I drank every damn page like it was my only source of water.This wasn’t the typical third-act conflict type of book. NOPE. It was riddled with ups and downs but you can’t help but feel everything with these characters. It had depth and was plain amazing till the freaking end.

𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐒𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐋 𝐌𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐍𝐓𝐒.They gave me all the feels. The soft touches. Him randomly tucking her hair behind her ear. Her just staring at him bc he’s so damn hot. The forehead kisses.

This man is the most caring, reckless and loving creature that managed to work his way into my soul. He’s so thoughtful and his inner monologue is so funny. But their banter is even better 🤌❤️‍🔥He actually had his own life in this book too. Sometimes dual povs just feel like one because they’re both living the same thing. But this book showed the distinction between their thought processes and how they’re actual individuals, not the same brain.Gosh, 𝗔𝗡𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗦𝗜𝗔 𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗘𝗡 was so relatable. It was so hard seeing her go through all that shit but watching her grow stronger and healthier was so rewarding. I’m so proud of how she dealt with things.I loved how she became amazing friends with the team and cared about them like family. I loved her for saying what she wanted and sticking to it too. I’m so glad she had a spine and stood up for herself when it mattered.I’m genuinely so impressed this is a debut novel and I cannot WAIT to read more from Hannah Grace!!Whew!

434,"Icebreaker (Maple Hills, #1)","To sum up my thoughts very quickly… there was too much going on and yet somehow there was also absolutely nothing going on - so out of a weird mix of annoyance and boredom, I DNFd it at 50%But in case your interested in details…I should have realized right away that I wasn��t gonna like this book when I had a really hard time digesting the writing. There was something about it that wasn’t flowing smoothly from the pages into my brain and therefore I was reading it really slowly and found myself putting it down a lot (which is a very bad sign)Then there was also so much info-dumping for all the side characters. It felt like she already pre-planned out a multi book companion series and was trying too hard to get us invested in all of the side characters by giving them each so much detail and page time.We’ve got her best friend (Liv) who’s starting to get with his best friend (Robbie). Her skating partner (Aaron) who’s mentally and emotionally abusive to her (but she doesn’t realize this even though she’s been in therapy for years and supposedly is really good at expressing her thoughts and figuring out how she’s feeling… but okay.) There’s also a bunch of guys from the hockey team that end up becoming a part of this large friend group that’s forming (JJ, Henry, Russ, Bobby + more). Did I forget to mention Robbie? Yea, he’s Anastasia’s fuck buddy at the beginning of the book because she doesn’t have any interest in committing to a relationship because she just wants to focus on her training and skating career…. but it’s okay because early on he ends up starting a relationship with someone that Liv (Anastasia’s best friend) absolutely hates… so now her and Robbie are just best friends who sleep in the same bed together without shirts on sometimes… nbd (🙄)Then there’s Nate. He’s a sweetie and I liked him enough - but not enough to keep reading. Especially because I really didn’t like Anastasia. As for their relationship… I didn’t like that either. It was a-lot of tell and no show - and the few times there was show and they actually had a minute alone with each other, they would just get it on (yawn).As for the actual plotline - there was none. Yup. None — Basically all these characters meet for the first time when they are forced to start sharing an ice rink and that’s basically just a setup for them all to become friends… and then the rest of the story (from what I’ve read) is just watching them do everyday college shit like go to parties and bars and study and go to training and boring things like that.The funny thing is, is that right at the halfway point is when we get the second half of what was mentioned in the synopsis… where Aaron (the abusive skating partner) causes a ton of drama by getting injured and blaming it on Nate - so Nate ends up getting benched for a while and decides to fill in as Anastasia’s new skating partner…. and that’s right around where I gave up on the story.… and I’m just sayin… don’t put something in the synopsis if it’s not gonna happen until midway through - IMO the synopsis should only have information that takes place in the first 50-100 pages… but what do I know?So to sum all that up again… there were too many characters, too much drama, and somehow there was nothing actually going on other than all these people hanging out a bunch and Anastasia getting it on with Nate every time she was drunk and horny.Is it crazy to say that I have so much more I could complain about?? Even after my longest review ever?? It’s fine, I’ll stop myself here… but just know… I had more.",1
435,"Icebreaker (Maple Hills, #1)","FUCK THIS BOOK AND EVERYBODY IN ITTTTT. Stupid instalove shit with a self righteous poorly executed “girlboss” mc who’s whole personality is being sassy and shallow but really she’s fighting demons 🥺🥺🥺🥺 SHUT UP and the love interest is somehow even worse at the beginning of the book he’s said to be in love with a girl and wants to marry her but completely forgets she even exists upon meeting Anastasia? By the way “Stassie” is one of the ugliest nicknames I’ve ever heard in my life. Bitch isn’t the Loch Ness monster.SECOND OF ALL the way he’s immediately like “omg I would do anything to hear Stassie’s laugh again 😍” SHUT THE FUXKKKKK UP YOU JUST MET HER PLEASE LIKE it’s actually painful and So Fucking Forced too. They don’t have two molecules of chemistry to rub together. You can tell the author was literally forcing infatuation on Nathan.THIRD OF ALL the plotline is ass. The author is clearly going for an enemies-to-lovers but Anastasia shouldn’t have even been mad at Nathan in the first place because it was over a minuscule predicament that wasn’t even remotely his fault. “I was planning on being mad at you forever” OVER FUCKING WHAT???? Id get it if she didn’t like him because he’s a useless pushover douchebag who’s literally obsessed with her but she doesn’t even gaf about that. It’s just cuz his teammates ex girlfriends boyfriend or some shit, who he has nothing to do with, fucked up their rink.FOURTH OF ALL nobody in this book has any decorum or home training. Why does Anastasia never wear any goddamn underwear to SOCIAL OUTINGS?Nessie went commando to someone’s BIRTHDAY PARTY. And I’m not sure about you but I wouldn’t want my boyfriend sleeping in another woman’s fucking bed because they’re “best friends” *COUGH* RYAN *COUGH*. And these bitches are talking about sex and literally Having sex in Ubers like MANNERS. THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING CAR OH MY GOD.And for a final note: just how much I hate this stupid useless couple😊 Nathan saying he won’t fuck Anastasia when she’s drunk and 1) Nessie getting literally offended by him saying no and going back to being a complete self righteous bitch FOR NO REASON (for a modern day “woke” book the word “no” doesn’t seem to mean as much when you “don’t take rejection well”! (Stfu!!! No Consent is no consent!)) and 2) they fuck literally a couple days after even though she’s drunk AGAIN. SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT SHIT.Yeah this is garbo ok bye LOVEU.",1
436,"Icebreaker (Maple Hills, #1)","4.3 ⭐️it should’ve been me… to start off, i folded throughout this entire book. it’s always the nice guys with dirty mouths that get me in heat. and i know i’m gonna die alone at this point because i will accept nothing less than nathan hawkins….anyways….um the plot…where was it? lmaooo nah but fr why tf was this book so goddamn long. don’t get me wrong the filler was actually good. like i kinda enjoyed reading about them just being a couple and doing couply things. lowkey wish they didn’t get together so soon but whatever. and half the time i couldn’t distinguish between the side characters so whenever they’d say something i kinda just tuned out. unless it was what they texted in the group chat. that was actually funny and worthwhile 😂 aaron can fall into a volcano for all i care tho.Anastasia…your honor i love her. i enjoyed reading about her character growth and development. she’s a 10/10 baddie i gotta say because when she did the splits on Nathan’s dick…why tf was i breathing heavy? the things she’d say to make him blush???…bruh we were both blushing. i appreciated how she always said things straight. point blank period. there’s literally no miscommunication when miss girl is around and i admire that. she’s also way better than me for putting up with Aaron uglyass Carlisle because i would’ve pounded that pricks head into the fucking ice if someone spoke to me like that.Nathan Hawkins…ok i hate to admit it but this mf was really holding this book together. there’s something about a guy willing to get down on his knees for you in a second that’s just so poetic. and god damn the mouth on this man had me tearing my pillow in half. the fucking praise 😩😩😩 the way he so unconditionally loves Anastasia was so lyrical. and oooh when he saved Anastasia from almost drowning…your honor, is it problematic it that i found that kinda attractive?? hmmm 🧐in conclusion, if he ain’t nathan hawkins… get the fuck outta my face",4

448,"Icebreaker (Maple Hills, #1)","I fell for the cute cover and the figure skater x hockey player trope, but honestly this was so NOT good for me.I liked Nathan –the hero–, because he was sweet, caring and understanding, while also being charming and a little bit cocky, but I guess that's it?1. I didn't like the heroine because she was presented as someone determined and focused on her career as a figure skater, but all her actions towards that goal made her look childish and annoying for me because of the way she treated those around her, as if they were disposable, and almost as if she was doing them a favor by giving them the time of day, when at the end of the day she was always the one who came back for more because of that feeling of familiarity she didn’t had before.2. There were too many side characters that I couldn't keep track of, and at some points they stole the limelight in this book, while others became more and more annoying with each intervention (Henry please shut up, you stopped being quirky like 20 chapters ago). Also I don't wanna be like that, but I really feel like the author tried too hard to score those rep points while not even using google translate properly.3. And then the plot dragged and dragged, forever and ever, AMEN. I heard this was a Wattpad story before and maybe that's why the whole plot feels a bit cut off, but gosh, a new conflict after a few chapters? It was a few conflicts too much. I can't even remember how many acts this book had because they felt endless to me.",2

The lengths I’d go to if you’d let me. What I’d do to make you happy.””In a world where I feel like I could be swept away by the waves at any moment, he anchors me. I value that, value him.”“You’re worth defending. Every cut, bruise, every single pang of anger or frustration. It’s all worth it. I’d throw my last punch defending you because you deserve to have someone be that person for you, and there’s no one more qualified for the job than me.”i’m embarrassed to say i was excited to read this book. am i being dramatic? maybe. but listen:i genuinely tried liking this book.i put up with the boring first few chapters. but wow!! all of a sudden it picks up! is that supposed to make me like it more? who knows. from the very beginning, i didn’t like the main character that much. she gave me pick me vibes and it’s clear the author tries to make her different from other fmc’s. while i appreciate this effort, i could not bring myself to like her.one thing i did like? ryan!! they had a dynamic that i loved and they cared abt each other in a way that wasn’t overbearing. not to mention the way anastasia was supportive of his relationship with olivia! i have to admit it was a nice change and it was completely understandable. i found his character to be so sweet and i wish we got more of his and anastasia’s friendship. i also liked sasha & anastasia’s friendship despite the embarrassing things that happened when they first met. i am never getting over it.“I’m going to teach you how to be nice.”“I’m sure there are plenty of things you can teach me, Nathan, but being nice isn’t one of them. I’m a delight.”my main problem with the main character:she tried too hard to be grumpy.she was also super overdramatic and she swore to hate hockey players bc of a typical stereotype but one interaction and she realizes she starts to like them. the next thing she does is complain bc she was only willing to like henry. it was infuriating and annoying with how she tried hating all the hockey players. her inner dialogue was so hard to put up with because of the way she simply talked. she was WAY too stubborn for my liking and i did not like it at all. i’m so glad she gave up that behavior bc i wouldn’t have been able to stand the book if it continued like that.i thought there were times where i did seem to understand anastasia. she reminded me of monica geller with the way she was described! from her competitive nature to the way she was “compulsively organized”. it’s also clear how she cares a lot about the people she loves. however they differed in many different ways with how “grumpy” she is and her demeanor around new people.a small spoiler for this quote possibly!!“It felt good hearing him make plans for the future, and I could pretend I don’t know why, but denial is useless at this point. Everything he says makes me melt, and half the time I don’t know how to react, so I kiss him, then things escalate, and before I know it, I’m screaming his name and seeing stars.”—this was one of the many examples within this book that shows there’s no plot, it’s justsex driven.overall, this book wasso slow. it might seem fast paced with the events, but it slowly eased into a normal routine of them fucking every other chapter. it becomes so boring to read the same damn thing every time. it throws you off at the beginning just as an excuse to slow down the plot and focus on them doing it. however this book was great with keeping everything consistent. the amount of pages for each chapter stayed relatively the same and they didn’t favor one pov over another!if u saw my reaction while i read this book, you’d be familiar with these quotes.“I swear to God I will leave you in this airport,” Nate grumbles, slapping my ass, laughing when the noise causes an elderly couple to turn around and look at us, making my cheeks blush.”“It’s like he flicks a switch somewhere and suddenly it’s Niagara Falls between my legs.”mid way this book became entertaining. not for the plot, which remainedboring and gave us nothing. but i genuinely laughed out loud bc of how cringy the writing was sometimes & how it gave off wattpad vibes. the writing itself was entertaining. there was so much smut and usually i don’t mind but there was unnecessarily too much in this book. what was the purpose?? i was going to give this book 3 stars at this point. things were looking up and my rating slowly increased. i also liked the banter between the characters! it was pretty enjoyable on my part so there’s thatusually books that bring comfort involve the found family trope, but it’s not as present in this book mainly bc it focuses on friendships between the boys and anastasia, but even then it’s barely talked about there. plus, the main focus was the relationship between nate & anastasia, which in of itself is all abt sex. my favorite part is definitely the cooking lessons that jj and anastasia had together. cutest!!context: literally just gray sweatpants“He’s in a Maple Hills Titans T-shirt and gray sweats, and I hate myself for being a woman swayed by a man in gray sweatpants. Shit. No, there will be no swaying.””Gray, obviously, because Nathan Hawkins is a man who was most definitely written by a woman.”i hate nathan with a burning passion. this is the rare occasion where iWANTEDa third act conflict. i usually hate them butthey needed it!!he was below the bare minimum. i truly have no idea how anastasia put up with him. she likes a man who wears gray sweatpants and claims he is written by a woman. i wear gray sweatpants!! does that make me written by a woman? i would hope so but that’s besides the point.not every person who wears sweatpants immediately makes them written by a woman!spoilers from this point on“You think he’s going to manipulate her into forgiving him and then she won’t need you anymore. You like being needed by her. It makes you feel important. You know Aaron hates you and you think he’s going to keep her away from you. Which just shows you don’t know how strong she is, or truly understand how much she loves you.”“I shouldn’t have to scream that I’m not naïve or being manipulated for Nathan to trust my judgment. I shouldn’t have to beg him to understand that there is a difference between friendship and partnership.”these quotes single handedly ruined this book for me and made me hate nathan.nathan desperately needs therapy.i’m surprised she put up with the attitude that he showed her. i wanted him to be able to work out his feelings on his own so she would never have to put up with a man who cannot communicate his feelings bc communication is key!! instead they got pissed at each other and would put off arguements. then they don’t see each other for a few days and everything is fixed! i do appreciate the boys knocking some sense into him.“There’s a warm, full feeling in my heart when I’m around this team. It’s unfamiliar but familiar at the same time; a contradiction, I know, but so specific that it feels like it was specifically designed for me. It’s the feeling I didn’t know I needed until these guys crashed their way into my life three months ago.”speaking of the boys:i don’t see why people like henry.he made a LOT of backhanded comments to everyone and whether or not he can tell if it’s mean, i’m surprised they put up with him for so long. i do see that he cares for anastasia but from the beginning he was so blunt. there was ONE scene of henry being kind. he wasn’t even funny! he just had no filter and just cannot control his honesty. if he was able to control his honesty, i’d probably like him better.this book was so fast paced for the characters. this all happened within the span of 3 months.3 MONTHS.i get that the idea of the story is supposed to be that they don’t have any miscommunications and have a “healthy” relationship but i’ve found some problems within this situation. they move way too quickly and the way they address it as “we’ve spent so much time together so we’re built different” does not work for me. don’t get me wrong, they had their cute moments but it wasn’t enough to suffice for me.they don’t fight when they’re “frenemies” which i do appreciate but it’s obvious they wanted different things from the beginning. despite nathan knowing what anastasia wanted, they still got jealous whenever one hung out with another person and they didn’t address it. i feel like they sugarcoated everything and it’s clear anastasia doesn’t think on it much simply because she does not know how he feels. i’ve never met a man who’s happy to be her friend rather than upset that she just wants to be friends.here’s where the book gets confusing: they are obviously involved with one another but not exactly in a relationship type way. they don’t even get together until chapter 30. i honestly stopped caring for their relationship bc i was that done with this book. i thought nathan was desperate and i just did not like them together all that much. sure, they can be cute but their whole relationship and personality revolves around fucking one another and when they were away all they would think abt is alone time between them.the supposed “plot” on the back doesn’t happen until mid way. sure, the ice rink breaks as soon as u jump into the book abt 2 chapters in but the second plot point took too long to happen. i wish it would’ve happened sooner to let the book pick up quicker and become shorter. also i loathe aaron in this book. do i really need to talk abt him? i’m pretty sure everyone hates him.i personally would not forgive nathan for what he said at the end. that might just be me being petty but i don’t want to take shit from a man!! i’d deserve better than someone who can’t work out their feelings bc i got my own bullshit to deal with. sometimes i couldn’t see the reasoning behind the things the characters did bc of the way they justified it. sometimes justification works butnot in this case!TW WITHIN THIS BOOK: EATING DISORDERi want to address the eating disorder that is part of the plot within the book but i also don’t want to be insensitive just in case. i just want to say i’m glad it was addressed and talk about! i didn’t like how late they addressed it into the book thoone more thing: i’m convinced them “playing house” is another way of them boning and making it their entire personality for the entirety of a few hours. this book really pushed my limits. it also sounds like something roleplay relatedˏˋ°•*⁀➷icebreaker - 1.75 starswildfire - tbrdaydream - tbrpre-reviewi had a nightmare i rated this book 5 stars. rtc",1

454,"Icebreaker (Maple Hills, #1)","I don’t understand how people can rate this book with 4 or 5 stars. I haven’t read something so unentertaining in a long time and only wasted my time for ten long hours.The book was way too long and too much. Too much drama, too much plot, too much was happening. I was half way into it when I already forgot what happened before because it.was.just.to.much, of everything. I wanted to dnf this book 10% into it, because it was so boring, but I never dnf a book before so I wanted to keep going. But it was just awful. I couldn’t wait until I finally (FINALLY) got to the end. (Have to confess I also skipped a few parts, mainly Anastasias chapters, halfway through the book because these awful, boring scenes weren’t bearable anymore after a few hours into it.)Aaron was a walking red flag since his introduction. I didn’t like him for a second (he gave me major bipolar disorder vibes with his mood swings). His character was awful und I didn’t enjoy a second of him being in this book. I understand that he was the main villain, but he shouldn’t have so much scene time. The main part of this book was for me hating him and I couldn’t enjoy anything beside because the next second he was back again and my mood fell. I don’t understand how people could keep up with him for so long, he clearly was a bad person (even if dumb Anastasia says other wise).Sabrine I liked just fine, but it’s doesn’t sit right with me reading about her behaviors while she is representing a muslim girl (or I suspect she is muslim because most of Algerians are), but I don’t know if she is for sure.Beside her there were too many side characters, I can’t even remember everyone who was there and why they were there.It’s shocking but the one person I disliked more than Aaron was Anastasia herself. Her whole character was so so so unlikable for me. Her freak-outs, how bad she treated Nathan even though he was always nice to her. The on, off, cold, hot she gave him and how she only liked him when she was drunk was annoying and irritating. Sometimes she acted like the biggest child and I hate how no one stood up to her and beat her in place, because she was such a mean person sometimes to the people around her (mainly Nathan who she always attacks without even knowing if he done anything wrong). She deserved to end up losing everything she worked towards. These „getting under his skin“ actions were unnecessary and childish. It was not funny at all and I hate Nathan for playing along with her every time she fucked him over again.It’s paradox how she is portrayed as a dominant, strong willed character with everyone else, but she lets Aaron walk over her over and over again till the last 2 chapters.I really hated her for every second she was present in this book more than I hated Aaron.What was Ryan’s purpose? He was a major part for the first half of the book but in the end he wasn’t even mention. Like he didn’t exist and the author just forgot he was there once. But he also is a person I didn‘t like. He was nice and all but he was interested in Olivia, wants more while laying half naked in a bed with another woman ? Kuddling her ? I wouldn’t want to talk to a boy who is seeing other girls beside me, let alone doing sleepovers with his ex-fuck-buddy.The only part of this book I liked was Nathan’s character. He was cute and polite, respectful, a green flag boy the whole time (even when he was mad that is girlfriend was fucked over and blinded by another man, as he should). He was attentive and always courteous. He cared for others more than he cared for himself. He took care of Anastasia, of his team, his sister. He was totally a golden retriever with a heart of gold. I wish he hadn’t ended up with Anastasia. He clearly deserves something so much better than her. Someone who loves him as equal as he loves, and Anastasia’s wasn’t that. She was just awful to him, treats him poorly and didn’t deserve him or his kindness.This one star is for Nathan and Nathan only.",1

Every single character talked like they were 15 and just found out about sex through giphs on tumblr. And honestly, sex is the only thing they talk about. Every single page. There is nothing but: who's hooking up with who, how many kinky things they've done, waking up and training while wasted from the parties they went to the night before, and how loud his balls are against her thighs when they're having sex.The FMC has a hardcore/severe eating disorder. AND THERE IS LEGIT A SENTENCE WHERE THEY EXCUSE A GUY KNOCKING SOMEONE UP BY SAYING:oh, it wasn't his fault, he doesn't know a lot about pregnancy. he's a good guy, he's just a 25 year old MAN who doesn't understand how sex works. so you gotta give him a pass.But yeah, if you want to know what this one is about, it's just a wattpad book that hasn't been edited.

This book is essentially just them live laugh loving all day.It reminded me a bit ofBinding 13, but with less interesting side characters, although some interactions were still hilarious.While we're on the subject,here's a daily useless remark I felt obligated to share: Henry (random friend) was cute at first, I always have a weakness for antisocial boys, but this one...Never let me come close to a genuinely nice man EVER again, I'll be his villain origin story.

He has SOCKS for random women he hooks up with. Hilarious.Anyway.......I think the best element for me was the figure skating. I'm obsessed with the sport, but there is also something about watching a hardened hockey player and a graceful figure skater falling in love. Total opposite sides of the same ice rink. It's so damn charming.The main couple was really cute in a domestic sort of way. Sometimes all they did was lounge around silently, yet those were moments I've felt the most single. The chemistry was at its peak.I’m curled up on Nathan’s lap under a blanket, his hand tickling up and down my leg and his other arm cradling me like I’m a baby. It sounds strange, but I’m ridiculously comfortable. He’s laughing away with his friends, talking about sports, and sipping on a beer.[...]Every so often he looks down and kisses me on the forehead, checking that I’m comfortable enough and I’m warm enough.Me in my room pretending like my heart isn't melting out my pussy at the sight of this disgustingly cute display.The bad news is this dragged...A LOT.PS: I demand Kitty's book.

462,The Silent Patient,"This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions.In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!?Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios.",1
463,The Silent Patient,"This is easily one of the best mystery/thrillers, if notthebest, I have ever read.Alicia shoots her beloved husband in the face five times, then never speaks another word. Theo, a psychotherapist, is captivated by Alicia's story and wants to help her. He thinks he can get her to speak again and divulge why she killed her husband. What follows is a search for truth in what really happened between Alicia and her husband.First of all, if you haven't read this book yet, you absolutely should. And you should stop reading my review and any other reviews/blurbs/thoughts about this book until you do. Because while I always strive to make my reviews 100% spoiler-free (this one included), there's something to be said for expectations. And there's no way reading anything about this book wouldn't sway your expectations.I made the mistake, after reading this book and loving it, of not only recommending it to a friend, but also talking up how much this book amazed me, how great the reveals were, yada yada yada. And so when she read it, she had built up an inkling of something to come and anticipated it, hence losing the element of surprise. So I inadvertently committed the biggest book faux-paus ever and ruined a fantastic book for a friend. It's something I regret to this day. (Elaine, if you're reading this, I'm so sorry!)I certainly don't want to do that again. So yeah, I'm warning you. Last chance to turn back if you haven't read this book.Okay, now that I'm among only those who are in the know, I feel like I can freely gush. How amazing was that reveal?! I usually have terrible book memory, but I'm certain I will remember that reveal for the rest of my life. It wasn't just what it was, but also how it was executed. Not only did I not see the twist coming, but I was so surprised I stared open-mouthed at my book and reread it multiple times to make sure my brain could comprehend the complete mind bend of what I had just experienced.But to simplify this story down to just its reveal feels like an injustice. At its heart, this is a confounding murder mystery and it includes all of the requisite parts—clues, suspicious persons, and red herrings. We are directed one way, then another. But like any great mystery, the real magic is in its sleight of hand. While we are focused on one thing, really something else is going on altogether. And at the end, we can only wonder at the sheer audacity of what it takes to pull off such a magical feat.The story grabbed me from the very beginning with an intensity that didn't let go. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I was turning the pages as fast as I could, immersed in the experience and loving every moment. It only took me a few hours to get through the whole thing, and at the end my head was definitely left spinning in the best way possible.Recently, I read it again. I wanted to see if the magic of the first time is still there or if, now knowing the twists, the story would feel lesser than. And I'm so happy to report that I loved it just as much the second time around. Now, instead of having to pay attention to the plot, I could really focus on how masterfully Alex Michaelides built up the mystery and its reveal. And it really is something to marvel at.I have to say, books of this genre are always billed as astounding and surprising when most of the time they just feel contrived and silly with no payoff at the end. But wow, does this book deliver! It's so darn satisfying to read such a compulsively addicting story, with twists done right that left me absolutely speechless.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The MaidensThe Fury~~~~~~~~~~~~This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

464,The Silent Patient,"CONGRATULATIONS-Goodreads Choice Awards Mystery & Thriller Winner!I feel like I should preface my review by stating that I have read A LOT of psychological thrillers, and coupling that with the fact that this was my most anticipated read of 2019 gaveThe Silent Patienta great deal of pressure. This will still be an overall positive review, but I felt I had to include some honest thoughts here as well for those readers who may need their expectations in line like I clearly did.The premise here is simply incredible; we have a woman named Alicia Berenson who is accused of murdering her husband and proceeds to clam up and keep quiet for the following six years, living during this time in a mental care facility called The Grove for highly dangerous folks. Enter Theo Faber, psychotherapist extraordinaire and flawed individual. He already has a respectable job elsewhere, but decides to transfer over to The Grove, even though it is a sinking ship, because he is obsessed with Alicia and solving the mystery behind why she murdered her husband. Along the way, we get snippets into Alicia's diary leading up to the murder, alongside of Theo's POV.I can't really give you anything more than this, because this is a novel that depends on you being fooled by the twist. You know, the big twist, the one where every blurb on the cover and every early review gives you a heads up, and perhaps that was part of the issue here for me. It seems these types of books that pull the wool over your eyes and take you by surprise are best enjoyed before anyone else has had a chance to read them. Let's come back around to the fact that I've been reading mysteries, thrillers, and suspense novels for decades, way beforeGone Girlwas written and these domestic dramas with tricky slight-of-hand became all the rage. If you are new-ish to the psych thriller scene, and you whole heartedly enjoyed recent novels such asThe Woman In The Window, you will adore this. It was a well written, compulsive, slow burning build up to an explosive ending. Structurally, it had everything you could ask for, as it was well researched, engaging, and the perfect length of ""includes what we need without being overly winded"".Unfortunately, I've seen this particular twist done numerous times, so I was clued in fairly early to what the big twist would be, and without spoiling or giving anything away, the lay out of the narrative in the second half of the novel is what fully clued me in, because it was too neat and tidy to end any other way. I will say that I was so satisfied and pleased with the way the author chose to close out the final chapter, and regardless of being surprised by the twist or not, it was a classic wrap up that will stand the test of time over the years.I think I'm going to wrap it up here, and please don't let my 3 star rating dissuade you from giving this one a try. Michaelides is talented, and his writing is gripping and keeps you turning the pages regardless of the big twist. I would be honored to read his next novel and will most certainly look for his name in the future. In the meantime I have found so much in this novel worth discussing, from the portrayal of mental health care to the inner workings of various marriages, and think this will make a great winter book club choice for readers around the globe.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy via NetGalley.",3
465,The Silent Patient,"Read anything else on your TBR first. Anything. Better yet, delete The Silent Patient from your TBR. If you do, you'll never know what it feels like to become aware that you could have spent that 4 - 5 hours reading a great book ... or at least a better book.... definitely a book that doesn't do a major disservice to anyone who practices in the mental health field or who lives with a mental health impairment, and maybe even a book that doesn't present misogyny on every page.The Silent Patient fails as a psychological thriller on all fronts. Its narrator lacks any credibility as a psychotherapist, as an employee, as a spouse, as a man. All characters are flat and inauthentic. The plot doesn't hang together. The solution telegraphs itself long before the ending, and still makes no sense. Michaelides wastes time on sub-plots that are irrelevant, introduces red herring characters with no subtlety so the reader is merely annoyed. Offers us a lawyer who is instantly available more than once to meet with someone he seeks not to meet., and a therapist who sees a former (long..... former, like .... years) patient at her home at 10 pm, and then risks malpractice by offering advice to him. And the writing is pedestrian, at best.Aside from its flaws as a psychological thriller, Michaelides demonstrates that he knows nothing about mental health diagnoses, treatments and indicated medications, but the biases he displays in this novel contribute to a culture of misinformation that may discourage a reader who needs treatment for therapy from getting it, and may discourage other readers from complying with a treatment plan that includes prescription medications in amounts that data shows have therapeutic benefits. The girlfriend, then wife, of the narrator, describes herself as ""crazy"" a dozen or so times, and yet this is not relevant to any sort of mental health diagnosis over the span of the novel. In a span of ten pages, he describes a character as being in ""a medicated haze"", but the med he names wouldn't cause that effect at any dosage. One psychotherapist meets with a patient 2 - 3 times and instead of evidencing any interest in the health of the patient, he primarily focuses on how her behavior might be disturbing her spouse. Another psychotherapist agrees to change a patient's prescription med mix on a whim, and overnight, without any plan for a gradual step-down or other concern for patient impact. A third character presses unidentified meds into a patient's hand and requires that she consume them in his/her presence. None of the medical professionals, save the one risking malpractice, demonstrate competency or concern for the welfare of their patients.All of the male characters running this facility repeatedly refer to all of the female patients as ""bitch;"" all of the patients in the facility are women. Every female character displays unpleasant behaviors that range in consequence from minor to severe: unfaithful, gossip-y, violent, vengeful, insecure, impulsive, annoying, tiresome, disloyal.I've written a review of this horrid novel only because I might spare a friend or two. Every time someone deletes this book from his or her TBR without reading it, an angel gets his wings.",1
466,The Silent Patient,"As you will see, it’s an incredible story—of that there is no doubt.Whether you believe it or not is up to you.Ohhhh, I see why this book is getting so much buzz:it is virtually unputdownable.I didn't actually have any plans to readThe Silent Patient. I just happened to see it hanging around in the new releases, took a quick peek, and thought-- why not? Well, I'll tell you why not. You absolutely definitely should NOT read this book if you want to go to sleep and get up for real life stuff in the morning. I read this until my eyes were like ""nope"" and closed on their own.It's very compelling. A psychotherapist called Theo Faber narrates the story and he announces early on that he's pretty ""fucked up"". He worms his way into a new job at the Grove mental health facility because of his fascination with the artist Alicia Berenson, who murdered her husband in an open-and-shut case and hasn't spoken a word since.But let us not forget that while Alicia Berenson may be a murderer, she was also an artist.Theo finds himself connecting with Alicia and feeling a desperate need to figure out why she did it. And, what's more, he wants to figure out why she is silent. What can't she say? What won't she say? The more he digs into her life, her family, and her past, the deeper in he gets.It's a fast-paced ride with short punchy chapters (oh, how easy it is to think ""just one more chapter""). The story has so many threads and little surprises to uncover. More questions arise at every turn. And even those who work out the main aspect of the mystery will probably still enjoy the journey of finding out why, and all the little shocking discoveries made along the way.It is true that those who have read a number of twisty mysteries will likely guess the truth, but I think there's enough goodness here to make it enjoyable anyway. Or it was for me at least.Full of thrills, artistic metaphor, twists and Greek tragedy.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube",4
467,The Silent Patient,"Alicia Berenson is notorious for an event that happened in the past, but since that horrific incident Alicia hasn't spoken a word. Theo Farber, a psychotherapist, has heard of Alicia over the years through the news and is delighted when a job opening becomes available that would allow him to work directly with Alicia. Will Theo get Alicia talking again? What actually happened all those years ago?Yes, this book really is as good as all of the hype. The writing on this was really top rate. Michaelides knew perfectly how to create intrigue and how to use dialogue with varying short and long paragraphs and short and long chapters to create the perfect pacing for this work. It was incredibly page turning, and the author definitely showed his chops as a mystery writer. He could write a master class in mystery writing. And this is his debut novel! What will Michaelides go from here? Personally, I can hardly wait to find out.Theo is gaining information about what happened in the past, but he is also questioning his own abilities. Can he really get Alicia talking? What are the professional boundaries of a psychotherapist? There was a little bit of internal monologue with Theo, but it wasn't boring or drawn out unnecessarily but raised some deep questions, causing the reader to think beyond just the superficial mystery/thriller. There was also some mention of art and its deeper meaning. It helped to create added depth to this book.Overall, yes, yes, and yes! This book is phenomenal if you haven't read it already!

468,The Silent Patient,"She tied her husband to a chair and shot him multiple times. Then she slit her wrists and waited for the police to arrive.At least, that's whatTHEYsay she did. For her part, Alicia Berensonisn't SAYING anything.When Theo Faber, Criminal Psychotherapist, takes a new job atThe Grove, he is well aware of their most infamous patient, Alicia Berenson.She's the woman caught red-handed after killing her husband, who has remained silent ever since.In fact, Theo's primary goal is to work with Alicia. He yearns to get her to reveal what really happened on the night her husband was killed, as he questions the validity of the official story.Through Theo's perspective, his investigation, and Alicia's own diary entries, the Reader is brought along on a hair-raising mystery that is not for the faint of heart.Iabsolutely lovedthis book.This is the type of Thriller that I really enjoy sinking my teeth into. The use of the diary entries, paired with Theo's investigations, made for a perfectly-paced reveal in my opinion!Michaelides is definitely an author to watch. I cannot wait to see what he comes up with next.Highly recommend!",5
469,The Silent Patient,"Wow, I'm still reeling from that ending! A mindblowing, to-die for twist!A fast read that kept me intrigued from beginning to end, although the shocker came at the end. Wait......wait......what just happened? This was how I felt as a read the last few chapters!Alicia Berenson is such a mysterious, intriguing character and I was trying to figure her out the entire novel.  I kept asking myself, ""What is up with Alicia?""She is a famous, talented painter and happily married to her husband, Gabriel. They live in London and have a cozy life.Why would Alicia murder him and then never speak again? You want to know, right? Well, I did and couldn't stop reading until I found out. It is the feeling you have when youjust have to know why!!The novel is narrated by Alicia's psychotherapist Theo Faber,  He is determined to ""fix Alicia"".  I was so invested in learning what the circumstances of Alicia's silence was and had to find out if Theo could save her.Would she ever speak again?READ IT NOW to find out!I wasn't going to read this one, and then requested it on NG and I'm really glad I did.  As you can tell, I really enjoyed it! Sure to be a 2019 FAVORITE !Thanks to Celadon/ NG for my arc. Book is out in Feb 2019 Review posted to blog.",5
470,The Silent Patient,"I hated this book. The women are all tired, cliched stereotypes that often veer into misogyny. For example, Alicia’s aunt is described the first time you meet her as an ugly, old face pressed to a window, and it only gets worse after that because—of course—she’s fat. Her “grotesque” (a word actually used in the book) appearance is apparently a mirror of her evil personality. How creative! The author takes that approach over and over again: young, naturally beautiful women like Alicia and Theo’s wife are worthy of interest, while the female characters Theo can’t find attractive—because they’re ugly, old, large, fat, fake, stupid—are only worth his disdain.Beyond that, the prose was tough to get through. And don’t even get me started on the diary sections, which portray Alicia as a woman who either sits in a coffee shop for hours on end, has sex with her husband, or paints him as Jesus (no, I’m not kidding). The chapters where she couldn’t speak were almost a relief.Overall, the author just seemed more invested in getting to the the clever twist ending than in writing a full-bodied story with women who seem like, you know, actual people.Which is a pity, because that clever twist ending had potential.",1
471,The Silent Patient,"5 shining stars!We finally have a winner. It’s really page-turner, meticulously developed, smartly written book. I liked the final twist and ending of the book. Did my spider sense catch it? In the middle I was suspicious something was wrong but it well played and fooled me once! Shame on me!This is a successful debut novel with different writing technique. It may be sensed that the writer also works for big screen. Fast moving pace, twisty, edgy tricks, reminded me of “Gothika”, “AHS-Asylum”movies landed on Hitchcockian suspicious, dubious atmosphere! Mind games confuse the hell of you and surprises punching your face!There is a character is quite deserved my biggest slap!!! But if I speak about the identity of character, it means I have to give spoiler about murderer’s identity! Great dilemma between revealing unlikable character and getting expelled from GR community because of my big mouth! So mouth zipped. Punches secretly clenched.Just read it and get some pain killers for over usage of your brain cells😊",5
472,The Silent Patient,"Sorry, couldn't finish it. Gave it a hundred pages. The story and characters just didn't hold my attention. Not enough conflict soon enough. Also, the motivation for why the main character wanted to switch hospitals to handle the woman. It might be explained later in the book as a reveal but for me it weakened the structure. Too much of a slow burn for me. I guess I like a book that has a thriller structure or at least closer to one. For me I need conflict on every page that pulls the reader through the text.",2
473,The Silent Patient,"The beginning hooked me in because I was intrigued to learn more about Alicia's story, how her husband was murdered, and why she chose to remain silent. However, the book ended up bordering as a cheesy murder mystery, with the main character acting like a white-knight detective who would question a bunch of cartoonish side characters that just outright admit their motivations or feelings about Alicia. The twist was interesting, but a bit shaky - I think it could have been built up in a more believable way.",2
474,The Silent Patient,"(2.5) This was a solid....mehfor me.I was excited to pick up this psychological thriller because it has been getting some hype but it was a disappointment. Didn't care much for the characters, the twist was so obvious, the writing just okay. The only redeeming quality was the audiobook which made it possible for me to finish this book.Unless you never read thrillers I don't think it's worth it.",2

478,The Silent Patient,"Dear Alex Michaelides,Brav-the-fuck-o dude 👏👏👏""Her silence was like a mirror - reflecting yourself back at you.And it was often an ugly sight.""And that, my friends, sums up this book perfectly.Dark psychological suspense is my favorite genre and books like this one are exactly the reason why.This book is the very definition of a page-turner. From the very first page I was seduced by the magnetic writing style of Alex Michaelides.Nothing is as it seems in this novel. This story is complex and multi-layered with a labyrinth of characters, each playing their part in the development of the plot.The author never once tries to lead you astray with erroneous clues in an attempt to distract you from an obvious conclusion. I never once felt like I had a grasp on how this story was going to play out, which kept me rapt until the last page.The blurb on the back cover says that the book has already been optioned for a movie and I'd like to put forth my recommendations for casting:Haley Bennett as AliciaandOliver Jackson Cohen as Theo(I expect a casting credit)I received an ARC copy of this book from the publisher. All opinions are my own.",5

480,The Silent Patient,"| |blog|tumblr|ko-fi| |“Please don’t let’s get dramatic.”I've been a bithesitantabout writing this review since the majority of readers really enjoyed this debut. Howeversince Goodreads allows us toexpressandrespectour different opinions I don't see any harm in being honest.I didn't hateThe Silent Patientbut I did find thisnovelboth ridiculous and incompetent.Just becauseThe Silent Patienthas a ""twist"" that doesn't mean it should be labelled as being a psychological thriller. There is little to no suspense, the mystery is laughable, the tension largely MIA. Thepsychologyin this one is...well,the depiction of psychiatrist and psychotherapists is at best, laughable, at worst, ignorant.The book hinges completely on its ""twist"", a twist thatalso renders the majority of the narrativecompletely irrelevant.This book seems to meyet anotherweak attempt of jumping on the domestic thriller bandwagon.In short:Calling this a novel seems somewhat misleading. This reads more like some sort ofhackneyedscript.LONG REVIEW AHEAD (if you enjoyed this book I advise you to skip this rant-review)The Silent Patientis a really flawed piece of work. I will try to tackle what I personally thought were the major problems this book had (and yes, this is my subjective opinion):✎THE WRITING(idiotic dialogues + inane monologues + ham-handed metamorphoses + a complete lack of a sense of place)✖ I likeAgatha Christieand she has what I would call a 'dry' style of writing. Her mysteries are heavy on dialogue. The many conversations that her characters have are witty, amusing and or entertaining. The descriptions she provides perfectly render the characters' mannerisms and surroundings.Michaelides' writing mostly consisted in a series of dialogues between two characters and itreads like a script. It would work if what they spoke like actual peoplerather than this:“Perhaps I’m imagining it.But I’m sensing something… Keep an eye on it. Any aggression or competitiveness interferes with the work.You two need to work with each other, not against each other.”“But remember, with greater feeling comes greater danger.”The dialogues/monologuescame across as being incredibly silly and they make the characters sound like children.✖ There wereplenty of dramatic and over-the-top statements and or phrases that really ruinedpotentiallysignificant scenesand or somber moments of contemplation:“Her silence was like a mirror—reflecting yourself back at you.”~“Now I saw the truth.[She] hadn’t saved me—she wasn’t capable of saving anyone. She was no heroine to be admired—just a frightened, fucked-up girl, a cheating liar. This whole mythology ofusthat I had built up […] now collapsed in seconds—like a house of cards in a gust of wind.”~“How was this possible?Had she been acting the whole time? Had she ever loved me?”~“Why did she do it? How could she?”Jeez, melodramatic much?✖ Theo’s narrative was filled withpainfully overdone monologuesthat have little purpose since they don’t make Theo into a realistic and nuanced character and most of the time they do not even further the plot. Alicia’s narrative (that is, her diary) makes no sense but more on that when I tackle her character. It’s safe to say that, given that her diary entries included things such as “It took me a moment to speak. I was so taken aback I didn’t know what to say” and “I feel joyous. I feel full of hope”, I had a hard time ‘immersing’ myself or ‘buying’ into her narrative.Since this book is a ‘domestic thriller’ both Theo and Alicia don’t have sex they ‘fuck’. Because writing ‘we fucked’ makes the story gritty and ‘dark’ [insert laughter here].✖The Greek ‘connection’.Done properly, I usually love it when contemporary books draw parallels from Greek myths and or classics.Done properly.Comparing people to Greek statues and having your main characters referring to themselves as being a ‘Greek hero/heroine’ is the opposite of subtle:“She was a statue; a Greek goddess come to life in my hands.” ~ “He looked like a Greek statue” ~ “the actress playing Alcestis looked like a Greek statue” ~ “my fate was already decided—like in a Greek tragedy” ~ “Casting herself as a tragic heroine”.We have Diomedes who comes from “a long line of Greek shepherds” (and tells Theo that “every Greek knows his tragedies”). And finally we have Alicia’s painting which is entitled Alcestis.Both the painting and Euripides play hadpotential. They would have been enough.We didn’t need the constant reminder thatThe Silent Patientwants to be a ‘tragic play’. Like many other things in this book,the blatant symbolism managed to ruin a potentially good analogy.✖ These characters donotsound British.They talk like Americans(or what Americans sound like in a CSI episode). There are no British cultural references and or British expressions. This book could be set anywhere.✖ The story is set supposedly in the UK. But really, there is 0 sense of place. Who cares about giving your characters a backdrop? Why bother rendering a neighbourhood or an area of London? Who gives a fork about what a room or place looks like? Let's remember: this story could be set anywhere (ornowheregiven how realistic it is).✖ You could say that thefocus on dialogues and flat scenery are reminiscent of a play...which is fine but it doesn’t come across as such.This book just reminds me of a ‘B-movie’ script.There is no tragedy, no pathos , no wit.A 2nd grade play is closer to a 'classic' play than this book is.✖There is this attempt to make the two ‘main’ women ethereal which did provides a few laughs:“Her white dress glowed ghostlike in the torchlight” ~ “I remember so much white everywhere: […] the white of her eyes, her teeth, her skin. I’d never known that skin could be so luminous, so translucent ; ivory white with occasional blue veins visible just beneath the surface, like threads of color in white marble. She was a statue.” ~ “strands of long red hair falling across bony shoulders, blue veins beneath the translucent skin”.✎THE CHARACTERS✖ Theo. Our wannabeTom Ripley. Within a few pages we know that he is obsessed with Alicia (which makes him incredibly unprofessional) and he for the most part he is justsoooodull and whiny. He moans about his childhood,and his wife, Kathy, who is cheating on him because she is a beautiful actress so...that's what they do, isn't it?, andhis attempt(s) to self-fashion himself as some sort of tragic hero fail epically. Afterthe big reveal...well. His character makes even less forking sense. He stalked Alicia before breaking into her house. He must have known learnt about her, or made same 2+2 type of reasoning upon learning of her arrest. And he must have realised why she kept silent, especially after he reads Alcestis.This guy issoooothick.Hisdramatic monologues, constant whinging, and complete lack of awareness(I've said it before this man is thick) made him into a really unbelievable character.✖Alicia...she is beautiful.She loves having sex with her husband and painting. That’s about it. We are told that she was ‘charming’...buthow can she have gained this reputation since she has 0 friendsand her only real relationship is the one she has with Gabriel (her partner or whatever). Jean-Felix is the owner of a gallery but they don’t spend time together or are on friendly terms.Who is she charming to?She is a complete recluse! She lives in London and is good enough painter and yet...she has managed to make 0 connections.Her diary entries make her sound at best guileless and at worst like adementedchild. Her character is just an object.She is there to look beautiful and tragic.She has a fewbasic reactions(she just “looks up” or “looks down”) or she doesthe good ol’ ‘banshee’ act, flinging herself in a sudden ‘rage’ towards Theo or another patient. Wow. Such a deep and complex portrait of abetrayed and traumatised woman.✖The cast of characters consists in cardboard cutouts. Going back to Christie, sometimes exaggerated character can be entertaining. Especially if they are a parodying a certain type of person (the writer, the artist, the gossipy old lady and so forth). Here we have mere ‘sketches’ of people.We have Christian, who doesn’t like Theo because he is amassive bellendbully: “Christian glared at me.” “Christian looked irritated.” “Christian rolled his eyes at me.” “Christian laughed that annoying laugh of his.”We haveProfessor Diomedes who is Greek and is “an unorthodox man’...that’s it folks. That’s his character. Also,I cannot seriously believe that he was so unprofessional and blind about Theo (and his flagrant obsession with Alicia).Yuri is another pointless and unbelievable addition to the story.He is the head psychiatric nurse and comes from Latvia so heobviouslyhas to be weird about women.Makes perfect sense. Then we have Stephanie who has very little page time or importanceTheo having never even know of her existence knows immediately, before she even speaks, that she is Caribbean). We also have the “jolly Caribbean dinner ladies” (who,surprise surprise, are only mentionedonce).We have a few‘ugly’characters who are either ‘mad’ and or violent(Elif, a ‘massive’ Turkish woman, who spends her time shouting or grunting because she is a patient and that’s how ‘ugly’ and mentally ill people behave.Lydia, Alicia’s mean aunt. She is grotesquely ‘fat’ and has lots of cats. She basically just glares, scorns, and spits at people). Paul, Alicia’s cousin, still lives with his mother so he looks like ‘virgin’ and in spite his size he seems ‘stunted’. Kathy and Gabriel arethe antithesis of credible(actors and fashion photographers manage to be self-engrossed and 1 dimensional). We have Gabriel’s brother...who is the typical chip-on-my-shoulder character (he has acne, he is balding, he is just a ‘lawyer’,boohoo). Jean-Felix owns a gallery so he is the embodiment ofsome sort of art-vampire.✎THE NONSENSICAL PLOT✖ Nothing much happens. It’s quite clear thatthe words that exist before the ‘twist’ serve as filler. Theo moans about this and that. That's about 70% of the novel.✖ There area series of stupid thingshappening forno apparent reason.such as Paul hitting Theo with a bat. WHY.✖ The Grove is not a forensic unit. I am sure that Theo should be doing a bit of paperwork to cover his 1 to 1s with Alicia. And everything thathappens in the Grove is extremely unlikely. Rules, guidelines, procedures are flung out of the window.✖ The ‘big twist’is predictable.We know Theo is unreliable.All of his actions towards Alicia, his research and his ‘interviews’ makeno bloody sense. He already knows about her! And unlesshe is incredibly thick, he should do 2+2 and figure out why she isn’t talking. The twist makes his motivations and approach to Alicia completely pointless. Theo hadn’t forgotten what he’d done, and his narrative isn’t in the format of a diary, where he would be deliberately lying and omitting certain things. Why not make this novel into more of a confessional? Or more in the vein ofThe Talented Mr. Ripley,You,Lolita, or evenGentlemen and Players, where we know early on what he has done and we wonder if he will be caught or if he will done something worse.IN CONCLUSIONThe Silent Patientmight notbe the worst novel I’ve read but it’sa badly written, poorly developed book. Worse still,The Silent Patientcomes across as being both pointless and passionless.A ‘twist’ needs—demands—a story. I want to read characters who vaguely resemble or talk like real people. If you want to play with stereotypes (a la Christie) don't make yourcharacters take themselves so seriously.A parody of a certain 'personality' should at least be funny and or amusing.Adding a strong setting and a coherent storyline wouldn’t do any harm either.Overall:The Silent Patientis a messy, flat, painfully dull, 'Hollywood-type' of book.Read more reviews on my blogIf you likedVerity,An Anonymous Girl,The Last Time I Liedor the unintentionally hilariousJane Doe...chances are you will likeThe Silent Patient.",1
481,The Silent Patient,"(Throwback review) Isn't it strange that we immensely love and hate a book at the same time? Many of you might have had such an experience at least once in your lifetime. Well, this book was the one which gave me that feeling.First of all, let me start with what I liked in this book. The writing style of the author is suited for writing a thriller like this. He succeeded in making me glued to the book even after the glaring innuendos that were disparaging to the core kept me exasperated. He worked out the plot twist well. This might be the reason why almost every friend of mine in Goodreads love this book. I must confess now itself that if I was not a Doctor and I didn't know how the healthcare system works, I would also have given this book four or five stars.This is a book which won the best book in the thriller section in Goodreads award last year. If you are promoting a book as a psychological thriller, there are two things which the author should be careful about. One is to get the thriller aspect correct, which the author had succeeded, and the second is to get the Psychological aspect right, which is where the aberration lies here.The author had unabashedly mentioned some things about Psychotherapy in which some are true in some rare cases while some have unfortunately gone entirely wrong. The author has no right to generalise about the health sector as a whole based on some scrupulous activities done by some individuals. You can't even see such a shady Psychiatric institution in any dystopian world. Mr Michaelides, who is a Cambridge product, had an excellent opportunity to produce one of the best thrillers. Unfortunately, he didn't do the adequate research in the psychological aspects needed for this book.There are many mistakes regarding psychotherapy, treatment methods, various disorders, therapy sessions, medical ethics in this book. Initially, Theo, who happens to be a psychotherapist, is strangely saying that his father had a personality disorder which he is mentioning as an illness that went untreated for the duration of his life, which is, in fact, rather absurd. There is no definitive treatment or drug for the management of personality disorders. The only way in which we can manage it is by behavioural modification therapies like the DBT (Dialectical behavioural therapy) and CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy). I am sharing four pictures here for my friends who are utterly perplexed due to being thrown into the crazy world of complicated medical jargon by the author in this novel bolt out of the blue.The author should have done more research on topics like the transference, countertransference, Borderline personality disorder, Narcissistic personality disorder before writing this book.I remember having an entrancing discussion about this book with one of my friends who is a Psychiatrist in D.C. We concluded that we should not be pedantic about it and leave it alone as just another painfully didactic fiction which came in the disguise of a psychological thriller.It is poignant to see Entertainment Weekly calling it ""an unforgettable — and Hollywood-bound — new thriller"" with ""a mix of Hitchcockian suspense, Agatha Christie plotting, and Greek tragedy."" I heard that the silver screen version of this book is in the pipeline. I humbly request Mr Michaelides, who also happens to be a screenwriter to correct all the flaws in the novel in the upcoming movie.I had the expectations of being enraptured by this book before reading it. But unfortunately, I abhorred this book to such an extent that I curtailed from reading other thrillers for some time. All the other thrillers I might read after this one will be desultory attempts. I am sure that I will recover from this one. I am sad that Alex Michaelides missed a golden opportunity to create a masterpiece.",1
482,The Silent Patient,"My thanks to Ben Willis at Orion Publishing Group for sending me a paperback copy of ‘The Silent Patient’ I have given an honest unbiased review in exchange*Alicia Berenson was discovered standing over her husband - he’d been tied to a chair and shot in the face five times. Alicia gives no explanation and refuses to speak. She’s admitted to a psychiatric unit, ‘The Grove’ in North London, and six years later she still hasn’t spoken - not one single word!Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has always been obsessed with Alicia’s story, and when a position presents itself at The Grove for someone with his qualifications, he applies for the job and is successful. Theo is certain that he can get her to talk, even though others have tried and failed.Although Alicia is silent, the narrative speaks to us in a way that she can’t or won’t, throwing the spotlight on the minutiae of her life as a talented artist, and ultimately what led to the events of that fateful night.Theo’s own personal life is laid bare too, and he’s also a very complex character - indeed not unlike Alicia. If Theo’s attempts to encourage Alicia to speak are successful, will it be something he wants to hear? Because beneath Alicia’s silent exterior, she has plenty to say!Clever, and compelling, with a humdinger of a twist- I hope the ‘Silent’ Patient ‘speaks’ to you too!",4
483,The Silent Patient,"4.4/5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️“...we often mistake love for fireworks - for drama and dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still. It's boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant.”HOLY SHIT! Wasn't this a mothefucking page turner? Like I literally read and listened to this in 2 home sittings, and 2 subway sittings. Holy motherfuck! I knew this Greek author could do it!#proudtobegreek. Honestly, all the Greek mentions in this book were porn to me. He wove a whole story so beautifully based on a Greek tragedy, it's wonderful. Anyone who is Greek in here, read this book. Love me some nice representation!This book was split into two sections:1:Theo's point of view2:Alicia's point of viewTheo's point of view is split into two categories... him talking about himself and his wife and him talking about Alicia and himselfAlicia's point of view is seen through her diaryI found myself not as interested in Theo's chapters about his wife as I was in the entirety of the book. I knew it is the kind of story where this part would actually mean something to the main plot and not just to show us aspects about Theo's life and his personality, but they were the least interesting chapters for me nonetheless. Apart from that,the book itself was extremely fast paced, deep and exhilarating.I just couldn't for the life of me, stop turning the pages. You all know your girl lost sleep for this. Yes, I motherfucking did.Was the twist good and unexpected? Yes. Did you have to suspend your disbelief a bit to make it work in your head? Yes. Was it amazing nonetheless? Yes. Listen, it was a really great twist but if Theo had told us from the beginning, it would lose the momentum.So it's a twist based on a character not telling us something he already knew.I find that a tiny bit weak. But it worked with the story and I fucking loved it ok?Overall, I loved this book so much. In this review I talked about the two reasons I didn't give this book 5 stars but don't let it fool you. This is one of the best books I have read this year and it will probably remain in this position once the year ends. It is full of intrigue, interesting characters and dynamics and a very fresh story. Trust me and pick it up. K bye now!",4
484,The Silent Patient,"Alicia Berenson, a famous painter, shoots her fashion photographer husband in the face 5 times, killing him and then never utters another word again. Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist, has been obsessed with Alicia and her silence for years and he finally works his way onto the staff of at the Grove, a secure forensic unit and then manages to secure the position of Alicia's psychotherapist. Very little is really the way it seems in this addictive psychological thriller and it had me on the edge of my seat from the first chapter.I had so many questions about what was happening and what had happened with both Alicia and Theo. Theo is so ready to lie, manipulate, and use people and even though Alicia was the murderer, think I felt more danger from Theo and his shady practices. And then I was hit with twist at the end of the book, which took me by surprise. I knew something was up but I hadn't quite figured it out and was thrilled with how the book took me for ride, tripping me up along the way.Published February 5th 2019",4
485,The Silent Patient,"***NOW AVAILABLE***Well looks like I’m the outlier on this book as I have been reading many glowing 5 star reviews. Maybe I’ve been reading too many thrillers lately. For me to love a thriller all of the characters have to be well developed and intricate to the story, the plot has to be a good one and have more to offer than just the “thrill”, or wow factor at the end of the book. I found the characters to be shallow and the plot seemed to run off in several directions throughout the course of the novel.I should add that a 3* from me means that the book was just an o.k. read for me, not bad but not great enough that I will be thinking of it long after I’ve finished or be recommending it to my friends. Still worth a read :)One thing proved true, this book did have me turning the pages quickly to find out what would happen at the end. However while I was turning these pages quickly, I wasn’t really getting very much out of the story. I felt as though the fact that she wouldn’t speak was the main focus of the book rather than looking into whether she was really guilty or not. I know that she had been tried and found guilty but I had hoped that perhaps the doctors would find other issues worth pursuing regarding her guilt or innocence.There are multiple characters introduced but none of them are really very well described. Dr. Diomedes is the head of the facility and he appoints a new doctor, Theo Faber, who has recently joined the staff to oversee Alicia’s care. She had previously been under the care of another physician but he hadn’t made any progress with her and so it is hoped that this new doctor will help to make her finally speak.The book is narrated by Theo and then later by Alicia as we begin to read her previously hidden diary.The book takes place in “The Grove” a private facility for psychiatric patients. Theo Faber transferred from another facility because he is obsessed with Alicia’s case. We do get to know him through his thoughts about his own marriage to Karen who seems increasingly “busy” and coming home late from rehearsals, she is an actress. This is a storyline that is introduced and somewhat developed and then just left hanging. What really is going on with Theo’s marriage? He seems to be spending all of his time at the facility with Alicia.SPOILER ALERT***Alicia had been a successful artist and Gabriel a photographer of some repute. There really is never any answer to the question of “why”, why would Alicia kill Gabriel. There doesn’t seem to be any evidence that they were unhappy or that Gabriel was unfaithful, there doesn’t seem to have been much research as to why she would kill her husband. She was convicted because she was found at the scene with the gun in her hand, covered in blood because she had slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself.The twist is a good one but doesn’t come until the last 20 pages or so. I had pretty much figured it out by then but I’m sure it will come as a surprise to many.I would say read it without reading lots of reviews, decide for yourself if it is indeed “the debut novel of the year for 2019” as the publisher has written in the blurb for the book! After the last session that Theo had with Alicia he is writing everything down while it was still fresh in his mind and he states ""As you will see, it's an incredible story--of that there is no doubt. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.""I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.",3
486,The Silent Patient,"The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides is a 2019 Celadon Books publication.When this book first started to garner a little buzz, I initially shied away from it. I am still avoiding psychological thrillers for the most part. However, the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive I relented, adding it to my TBR list. After a lengthy wait at the library, I finally obtained a copy, and dived in with no small amount of cautious optimism. Was it worth the wait? Did it live up to the hype?The set- up is instantly intriguing-Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist is oddly obsessed with the well- respected artist, Alicia Berenson, a patient housed in a forensic unit after shooting her husband five times in the face. She hasn’t uttered a word since. Theo sacrifices better and more lucrative opportunities in hopes of becoming her therapist. As he manipulates his way into Alicia’s life, his determination to unlock the secrets of her heart and mind slowly yields a few surprising results. However, all his probing could have a few unforeseen consequences...Anyone who has read a review for this book has, by now, heard about the stunning twist that apparently caught most readers off guard. But, let’s not get too hung up on the twist. In my humble opinion, a mind -blowing twist is a requirement of any and all psychological thrillers. What makes a twist work in the first place is the mystery.Did Alicia kill her husband, as all the evidence suggests? If so, what was her motive? Why hasn’t she uttered a single word in all these years? This is a compelling mystery. Alicia an enigma, to be sure. This is unsettling enough on its own merits.However, the author also examines some hard truths about institutions that rely on funding, which leads to money and power taking precedent over the welfare and health of the patients. Adding in yet another rich layer is the unique and quite interesting mythological parallel woven into the story.It is easy to step into Theo’s narrative as he slowly walks us through Alicia’s past, dropping hints and clues along the way, introducing us to all the possible suspects, while delving into Alicia’s fragile psyche.But, if I am being totally honest, the plot is not all that plausible, and at times the execution warbles. There are some problems within the story, but in my humble opinion, this is how a pure psychological thriller should be presented. The author relies on paranoia and the emotional instability of the characters to build suspense as opposed to grisly, graphic crime scenes. It’s a mind game from start to finish.Now, about that twist-The most important thing to me was that it was singular. No over the top, unnecessary twists added for mere shock value. A good PT doesn’t need more than one, maybe two, depending on the author’s experience or the situation- in my opinion.In this case, the reader is totally blindsided, tapped on the shoulder from behind, by a revelation so shocking, I’ll bet some of you gasped out loud. I know I did! It messed with your head, right? Now THAT’S what I’m talking about!!Of course, after all that buildup and the success of the big plot twist, the ending had to come together, or all was for naught. I was a little concerned for a few minutes, but honestly, the conclusion was the cherry on the cake.The book was worth waiting for, but I am glad I proceeded with caution and kept my expectations in check. The story is not quite strong enough to merit a five -star rating, but I appreciated the pure, traditional understated approach. The author wisely dialed things back, distancing himself from the oversaturated parodies many current psychological thrillers have become. I hope the popularity of this book with inspire more authors to follow this more authentic prototype and restore the psychological thriller back to its former glory.",4

488,The Silent Patient,"The thing about this book is that it’s only the plot twist.The story itself is just leadup to it. Everything after it is just explanation. And there’s no other substance: no compelling characters, no particularly lovely prose, nothing.So at least I was surprised by the twist. Otherwise this would have been so infuriatingly disappointing I would have had to put the book over my face and take deep calming breaths in the dark for upwards of 45 minutes.All of that is to say that this has a very, very, very slow start, and the writing fell very flat for me.Plus it’s not...theleastwoman-hate-y book I’ve ever read.But we all have our things.Bottom line: Meh.-------------i finished this book 3 days ago. i just didn't have anything to say about it.review to come / 2.5? stars-------------dear book,please be scary.or thrilling.or plot twist-y.or surprising.or something. anything!love, me",3
489,The Silent Patient,"3 to 3.5 starsI have a few friends that are probably going to wonder why I am not rating this one higher. I did think it was a decent thriller and I can tell why many rate it high. But, it is also easy for me to tell why someone would rate it low. I am just going to hang out pretty close to the middleThe best part of this book was definitely the resolution. The build up to it was okay, but not all that suspenseful to me. There were a few big moments throughout the book, but it was mainly just exposition. Also, I figured out the ""mystery"" early on. This is not me tooting my own horn like I am an amazing detective. It was more like I stumbled on it by accident. About 1/3 to 1/2 of the way in I thought,""wouldn't it be interesting if . . ."" and that is exactly what happened!The characters were kind of flat to me. I think part of my opinion on them is tainted by the fact that I just finished another thriller, The Whisper Man. In that one, the characters are much more dynamic and the relationships are much more interesting. Despite some twisting and turning, the relationships here are plain vanilla and a bit predictable.I will stress again, especially because I know that many are rating this one highly, that my criticisms above are just little things that I felt and I know for certain that others won't feel at all. So, don't read my review and go in thinking it is going to rate middle of the road for you, too. You might be one who really gets into it!Basically, an entertaining thriller. Not too deep. The perfect book for a quick escape. Easy to read and follow the twists and turns. Solid, but not really exceptional.",3
490,The Silent Patient,"WOW... This is a great book.This is a psychological thriller, and it is one of my favorites. I really did not see the book ending like it did. I cannot say much about this book without giving away to much of the book, but I felt it was a great book with some of the best twist I have read. I think if you did not see the ending coming you will like it, but if you guess the ending will may not like it as much.",5
491,The Silent Patient,"FIVE STARSTHE SILENT PATIENT is a deep, dark tale of murder, love and revenge. This is a contemporary story steeped in a deliciously gothic tone. At the beginning of the book, we have a vicious murder, a frightening asylum setting for the criminally insane, and a suspect who refuses to speak. When Theo steps in to save the day as psychotherapist to the silent Alice, well….you are in for a twisted treat, so I can’t divulge anymore!I went into this book with expectations it would be similar to Alice Feeney’sSometimes I Lieor one of my old favoritesBefore I Go to Sleep. I was wrong, it is so much better! The main characters of Theo and Alice are richly layered with just enough reveals leaked out over time that you will constantly wonder “who is the unreliable narrator here?” (You will doubt yourself over and over and I LOVE THAT!!!).Truly, one of the best books I’ve read this year! I absolutely devoured it. Theo takes you into his head, explaining the psychology involved in certain situations, as if the reader is part conspirator, part solution. There are Freudian quotes sprinkled liberally throughout this mystery--pure delight for armchair psychologists!I listened to the Audible version--Outstanding!",5
492,Book Lovers,"""'i already told you, nora,' he murmurs. 'i'd go anywhere with you.'""OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOD THIS IS MY FAVORITE ROMANCE BOOK EVER NOW EMILY HENRY I'D ACTUALLY DIE FOR YOU I'M SERIOUSi finally read book lovers. and i literally want to DIEthis is about to be a ramble, so just bear with me.here is a nice little dilemma: there’s a bright side and a not so bright side of emily henry’s books.on the bright side, it fills me with hope and optimism and a belief that for one second, i am capable of love.on the not so bright side, it fills me with hope and optimism and a belief that for one second, i am capable of love.do you see that double edged sword?book lovers is my perfect romance. it will never, ever get better for me than this. i know this is such a bold statement, but let me explain why:book lovers had everything i want in a book, let alone a romance. it made me feel seen through nora. the workaholic city girl who’s seen as cold and withdrawn (nora’s ex’s you never even cry in the prologue was a personal attack). the neurotic control freak who’s terrified of even giving a tiny bit of that up. the older sister who would do anything for her younger sister.i don’t think the way i 100% related to nora will ever be replicated in any other book (this book and conversation with friends will always be it for me).this book is actually on my top 5 books EVER. my top 5 (in no particular order) now goes: the secret history, conversation with friends, persuasion, anna karenina, and…BOOK LOVERS.if you’ve been following me…you know how monumental this is for picky romance bitch elle. this makes up for every single horrendous romance book i read last year that i one starred.holy shit. this book is PERFECT. the characters, the chemistry, the emotions, the banter, the romance?? i actually cannot stress how perfect this is.i am picky and i am a cynic. i have been so consistently disappointed by anything romantic in my life. but this book made me actually realistically hopeful for the fist time. because while romance was the main plot, nora and charlie’s respective problems did not get overshadowed. the heavy topics mentioned were nuanced and fleshed out and handled with such a great amount of depth.nora is me. i can’t describe her another way. i have never read a character who so closely resembles my personality (frances from conversation with friends resembles the way i think + my self reflections, but nora’s personality is just completely me). emily henry crawled inside my brain and took my thoughts and my experiences. wow.reading this made me stupidly optimistic that maybe i can too find a very hot and swoon-worthy guy who can deal with me in all my control freak, neurotic, workaholic, bitchy city girl glory. one can dream.see? this is what good romance books do to me. it makes me actually have…(gags) hope.charlie is the perfect combination of sweet and sarcastic and aloof and brooding. also, at one point, he lines up all of his utensils in a row which was just SO hot to me? and the way he’s so blunt and straightforward and honest and heartfelt without being an asshole or cringey. he’s loyal and understanding and never makes nora sacrifice anything, which is something we really don’t see in romance books. god. what a perfect, perfect man.not only that, but this book has THE best banter and chemistry i have ever seen. and i don’t mean that lightly. and charlie. i promised i’d elaborate on charlie in my pre-review, so here is me trying to sum up just how much i love him.and this book. this book is also a love letter to all eldest siblings. the way nora loves her sister and the responsibilities charlie had. anyone who is the eldest sibling or an older sibling will 100% understand. emily henry is always able to write family with such heart and depth, and this is no different.i will never shut up about this book. i’m about to become SO insufferable for the next month.i can’t get over how perfect this book was. i’m going to reread it again tomorrow.",5
493,Book Lovers,"welcome to my main character era.i love emily henry.i’ve loved her since the first incarnation of my reading accounts, when i discovered a million junes based on an act of love from the universe, probably, and never looked back.i loved her fascinating, unique, sometimes creepy always lovely magical realism filled with banter and growth and stunning images.when she moved to romance, her books felt less like My Books, ones written specifically for me, but it was kind of wonderful to see them be The Book for so many other people.and then this one came along.and i hate to center myself again, but…just kidding. this is the same person who genuinely said yesterday that the rain was holding out for her walk home exclusively. i have no problem with indulging in narcissism, so:this one feels pretty made for me.i love sisters, and here our almost-as-important close-second relationship after the romance is between two crazy close sisters.i love nora, our cold and tough and mean but on the inside very kind and lovely and of course book-obsessed protagonist. (it will come as no surprise that i relate to her. or, well, relate on the first and third points.)i love charlie, who passes my single requirement for romance novel love interests with flying colors. (this single requirement is, of course, being obsessed beyond logic with our main character.)i love banter. it is the best part of any romcom and it isn’t close. this has plenty.i love having it all happy ever afters. i love when the magic perfect ending doesn’t just include love, but like 9 other neatly tied up subplots ending with confetti and rose petals or whatever too.i love being a tall girl, and i love that this book recognizes our struggle!!!

494,Book Lovers,"All these years spent thinking I had superhuman self-control, and now I realise I just never put anything I wanted too badly in front of myself.Yeah, I agree with the general consensus that this may be the author's best yet.I actually felt so-so about Henry'sPeople We Meet on Vacationand almost gave this book a miss, but my friend convinced me to pick it up and I am glad I did.Book Loverschecks all my boxes for romance-- fun banter, hardass heroine (can't deal with blushing damsels), a guy who might have his broody moments but isn't a d*ck, and steamy encounters.I'll get my one complaint out of the way and say I think we could have safely lost fifty or so pages of family angst, which pretty much always feels like filler in romance books like this.Outside of that though, this was a hit. In addition to the usual stuff I like, I also really appreciated how the author made use of their careers-- she a literary agent, he an editor --to challenge, point fun at, and subvert the romance genre's tropes.As a badass, hardworking city gal, Nora has been left by multiple past boyfriends for wholesome country women who bake and dutifully pop out kids. She's the b*tch in this trope; career-driven, ambitious, and particular about the shoes she wears, obviously not the kind of woman someone wants to be with in the long term. When her sister suggests a getaway to the country and, who knows, maybe her own country romance, Nora reluctantly comes along. There she meets, not a sexy lumberjack, but none other than Charlie-- a fierce editor from back in the city.I love how this book doesn't change Nora or punish her for being ambitious and hardworking. It's so true that men are allowed to be obsessed with their work, whereas women who do the same are too often treated as if they have an illness. I'm glad that's not the case here. I always hated to see powerful women tamed.",4
495,Book Lovers,"i didn't like this :(but i havereasonsso let's discuss:1. nora. god i so desperately wanted to love her. she's kind of stony and bitchy and so am i, ergo match made in heaven? not so much. the stony exterior was great but the immature center was irritating. i could understand her motives in wanting to keep her sister happy but her inability to solve problems and ask straight forward questions and allow her sister autonomy... big oof.2. libby. her character was never fleshed out enough to be even a little interesting. she has 2 outbursts throughout the story and each time i thought they'd be break throughs in making her have something to really say. but no. she had a different perspective on her upbringing than her sister which was interesting enough but her life wasn't interesting enough to have motivations. she has babies, that's all i gathered.3. charlie mcblandbland. he definitely feels more like gus than alex, which i guess makes sense given the similarities between beach read and book lovers. but beyond a decent sense of humor and some tragic backstory i again, did not find him interesting. i could feel emily henry attempting to make him a perfect match for nora with the older sibling, never picked by girls shtick but the sexual tension fizzled after the first encounter. boo.4. setting was not my fave. i've heard people say it's schitt's creek-y but there aren't enough charming characters to make that a thing.did i like anything?i suppose i can admit that there is some growth on the part of nora. she chases her dreams, lets a man into her life, and finally lets her grown ass sister be a grown ass adult.but that's kind of it. feels mean to do it but it's a 2 star read for me. at least beach read had that jaw dropping moment of unrequited love/mutual pining.",2
496,Book Lovers,"Book Lovers does a lot of things right with subverting Hallmark movies with a cold girlboss protagonist who, instead of changing her ways or mentality, is still appreciated for who she is and what she values, especially by the love interest. I like that being career-oriented, valuing independence, living in the city, and being childless are qualities that aren’t villainized nor expected to change in order to have a happy ending. The banter is fun, and I can see how the MC and love interest pair really well together. What gave the book more depth, though, was its focus on the MC’s own issues and relationship with her sister. This helped round the story to be both a combination of romance and interpersonal/family struggles.Perhaps I just have low standards when it comes to 3rd act conflicts in romance books, but I was impressed with how the author tackled this one. Rather than relying on misunderstandings, the conflicts presented felt more realistic and honest. I was even more surprised that there were not one, but multiple realistic conflicts that made it difficult for the MC to have her happy ending - and I appreciated that, because that's how life actually works. “There’s no happy ending for a woman who wants it all.”Sometimes it gets little info-dumpy for the sake of characterization and relationship building, and one could argue that the love interest isn’t fully developed, but I’m OK with letting these things slide. Book Lovers has much more positive things going on than negative, so I’m totally fine with rounding it up to 5 stars.",5

498,Book Lovers,"i’m already convinced Emily henry personally writes to me in her books and this book just proved it. this book is made for book lovers by a book lover. and it is especially made for the older sister who has a younger sister.i fucking love these characters with all my heart. idk i just feel like Emily can create some of the best characters that eventually become my comfort characters.Nora is complex, deep, funny, and relatable. She’s like blood dripping from fangs as Emily describes it. Charlie says all the right things. i love the way Charlie can read Nora like a book (pun intended) i love the way Emily henry describes the men in her books. Their chemistry was tangible. Their emotions were deep. They are beautifully flawed puzzles pieces that fit together. i admire them so much. if there’s anything emily henry can put her whole ass and tits into, it’s creating the best characters.the ending had me squealing and running laps around the neighborhood. it was so cute and wholesome.Emily henry’s writing is so unique to me and refreshing. she’s always been one of my comfort authors. i feel like she’s THAT white woman who is MY white woman. she writes for poc first, i’m convinced. she deserves to get her ass ate for birthing this masterpiece that’s all.also i think i love this just as much as Beach Read. like i can’t choose one over the other. i hold them both dear to my heart.",5
499,Book Lovers,"i wish i was capable of a teaspoon of the banter, humour, and snark that comes out of charlie and noras mouths. they are seriously a match made in heaven.but OTPs are nothing new for EH. she has a real gift when it comes to creating a connection and understanding between two people. i loved her YA books, but writing adult romance is her true calling in life.what i adored most about this particular book is how it doesnt take itself seriously. there is some serious themes and content, but the overall vibe is very ‘lets poke fun at hallmark movies,’ which i enjoyed. the big city girl in a small town trope always works for me, so it was fun to have her fall for a big city boy as they are both stuck in the small town together. both charlie and nora work in publishing, so i think the story might feel too meta at times for some readers, but i personally didnt mind it.i think this is a fantastic addition to EHs bibliography. if you enjoyed her other books, you will definitely want to add this to your TBR, as its very much the same charm and wittiness and romance she has made herself known for.a massive thanks to berkley for the ARC!!↠5 stars",5
500,Book Lovers,"Read by a book lover who didn't love this book🙂Don't get me wrong, it's no doubt so well written. The prologue and the first few chapters are brilliant. But soon after, it became incredibly dull for me. It didn't have the 'wow factor.' The characters are just bleh (sorry not sorry). I found Nora to be slightly more likable than Prem's dick- Charlie (Dating Dr Dil reference that has the potential to ruin any love interest named Charlie). So Charlie is just bland...like the rest of the book.The concept is not new. I found it to be similar to Beach Read but in a very uninteresting manner. I wanted to like this book but simply couldn't. It did not work for me. But I would still suggest to give it a try, you might end up liking it more than me🤷‍♀️",2
501,Book Lovers,LMAO WHAT IS THISSSSi have never struggled through a romance book as much as i did with this one??? nora? mid. charlie? mid. libby? mid.i’m sorry but there is not a single thing about this book that makes up for the fact that there is no substance to it. it feels like emily henry considered every trope that sells and decided to bunch them all up and incorporated them into this mess of a book. some of it was just so unappealing. i’m so disappointed:(i was so into the siblings relationship until they unironically referred to each other as “sissy” PUH-LEASE,1
502,Book Lovers,"I'm usually not big on romance...Quite frankly I'm often hoping the main female character will realize that the douche-canoe she's dating needs to be dumped but... this one was cute!

509,Book Lovers,"5 Huge Stars""I'm not ashamed of my upbringing, but the more you tell a person about yourself, the more power you hand over.""I've been trying to write a review for this book that was about the actual book and not just a bunch of TMI about me, but...the struggle is real. For that reason, I will probably be keeping this short so as not to overwhelm ya'll with a bunch of personal information no ones cares about.As all we crazy power readers know, sometimes it's timing...sometimes it's your mood...sometimes it's that you feel as if the characters were madefromyou and that you justgetthem.This book was all three for me. And I just loved everything about it.The pop culture references...the witty banter...the tongue in cheek meta-talk about romance novels and their cliched characters...the writing itself. All of it. Loved it. Every second. I mean, just look at this:""This place looks like a Cracker Barrel had a baby with a honky-tonk, and now that baby is a teenager who doesn't shower enough and chews on his sweatshirt sleeves.""^I wish I had written that.What did I love most though?Nora.I ADORED her.Because I basically AM her.In so many ways. And, crazy as it sounds, being with her in these pages made me feel like I was hanging out with a friend who accepted me for exactly who I am.Here are some of my favorite quotes:""...barking heartless advice from the seat of her Peloton bike. You can tell she's evil because her hair is an unnatural blond, slicked back a la Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, and also, she hates Christmas decorations.""""That's the thing about women. There's no good way to be. Wear your emotions on your sleeve and you're hysterical. Keep them tucked away where your boyfriend doesn't have to tend to them and you're a heartless bitch.""""I'm a career woman with a weekly housekeeping service, a spare bedroom I turned into a shoe closet, and a Sephora credit card. I don't imagine my dream man is a lobster hunter.""""Mom's theory was that youthful skin would make a woman more money...good underwear would make her more confident...and good books would make her happy.""""'And what, just because I don't want kids, I would supposedly punish a pregnant woman for making a different decision than me? My favorite person's a pregnant woman! And I'm obsessed with my nieces. Not every decision a woman makes is some grand indictment on other women's lives.'""""I hate when I have to think about what my face is doing, especially because I'm never convinced it's translating.""""'I hated being a kid...I'd have no idea how to get someone else through it, and I definitely wouldn't enjoy it. I like them, but I don't want to be responsible for any.'""As a blond woman who is obsessed with books, skincare, Peloton, and my spare room closet...and who also works in a super male-dominated field with resting bitch face and zero desire for children...yes. Yes, I loved Nora.I also loved Charlie and just Nora and Charlie together. Their banter was absolutely delicious and the way they just understood each other...the things romance dreams are made of, folks.Anyway, I'll stop this gush fest here as I've pretty much slobbered all over the computer screen. There is more, but again, TMI. Plus, the Peloton is calling my name.",5
510,Book Lovers,"✨...I would…take the vasectomy over this✨To get it out in the open:No this is not a bitter rivals book at all, no she’s really not an ice queen and it’s literally not a secret, no he is most certainly not Roy Kent (even accidentally), and no the romance isn’t ultimately central to the story. I found this to be more of a sister relationship story with a romance subplot. The romance/relationship was basically reserved acquaintances to quick fondling friends. I thought I could love it but I just couldn’t keep making excuses or trying to convince myself that the next page would have the moment I’ve been reading for.If I was really trying to start something, I’d call this Frozen fan fiction.I mean seriously the word frigid is used enough, and the amount of ice/ice queen/frozen/ice in my body/I’m literally a block of ice with eyes language is astounding.I honestly don’t foresee many people having my same reaction to this book. I think it’s a fine, easy read but absolutely nothing special. Emily Henry’s name attached will make it special to a lot of readers and that’s fine. Sally Thorne is that kind of author for me. I thought it had potential, a lot of it, but it ultimately fell so flat. That disappointment made me the most upset. I gave it 2.5 stars for the “fine” easiness of it, but I didn’t round up because I think it could’ve been more than fine but it wasn’t and that’s the boob punch.Full review below. Sorry if I’ve wrecked your dreams of this one. Personally, I didn’t like it but I’ve been told I’m petty. This is the part I should say “but I hope you love the book!” But my previously established petty ass will forever and always choose to write about how misery loves company and that I’m saving you a seat.✨Overview:I was hopeful. I read the first 67% of this book super fast. I was t h r i l l e d that I was enjoying my time. I love to love books. I want to love books. It’s so much easier to love books. But I think looking back on that first two-thirds of the book, I was ignoring small and irritating things because I r e a l l y wanted to love this book. The relationship was cute, if surface level, and while the book was absolutely not rivals to lovers, I still liked the set up.But I was waiting for that spark to happen. That b i g revelation in the relationship when tensions are high and trust is fragile. The “I have a l w a y s loved you” painted bedroom or even the errant vasectomy (iykyk) big reveal. Something shocking or surprising or different.My kingdom for s o m e t h i n g.Anything. I really thought we’d get one. Instead I got a whole lotta Libby (main heroine’s sister), a weirdly placed Hallmark “Big City Person turned Small Town Person and Local Store Savior” moment, and book metaphors. So many book metaphors. (Thinking about it now, the “something” twist was here I guess…but it’s not regarding the romantic relationship so no dice and it wasn’t even interesting. It made a could be interesting plot point uninteresting.)✨Steam:I knew the last third of the book would feature their inevitable sex scene, but before we got to the Big Penetration Sensation, the moment that would wrap this book up with a bow, I was finally trapped by too many irritating things. They piled up to a height I couldn’t ignore; a height that cast a m o s t a g g r i e v e d shadow over the nice and tidy nothing special five-orgasms-in-one-sex-scene sex scene.Since I was already annoyed by the time we got to The Sex, the language was just way too flowery and metaphorical for me. I don’t care what the idea of Charlie feels like. Or just how much he resembles a book. I just want to know how he feels in your v a g i n a.The phrase “we fall into each other” made me want to gag. Just say you fucked goddamnit y’all are falling into each other all over the place! Ya topsyturvy mofos.I will say the sex was definitely more than I thought we’d get. There were three almost sex scenes prior to the Rolie Polie Olie fan fiction. The language went to the extent of “nipples” and “erection” but they did their jobs. The three prior scenes were each hot because the locales were super hot: front door, midnight pond, library. I think this is Emily’s hottest book. I would be fine with this sex/steam level in another book… with the one caveat that I actually like the rest of the book.✨Characters:Libby pushed me too far with her not being able to understand that Nora had a job and couldn’t just take three weeks off from work. Nora only worked until 5PM and took O N E phone call and Libby just had to puppy dog eye it. Nora was so self-sacrificial when it came to Libby. Yes I was annoyed at Libby, but goddamn girl take a hint and stop trying to help! She kept *covertly* throwing money at her sister it was weird. She gave up a lot of things and was about to do it again! She got some huge news and was like “but I’m so selfish for even wanting this during Libby’s midlife Hallmark crisis.” And when Nora finally got to lay into Libby, we were interrupted in such an eye roll way. Literally for fuck’s sake. It was my Rocky montage cut short by an untied shoelace and a face-plant into a bunch of stairs.I thought Charlie was pretty okay until he took a stab on the now communal blade of self-sacrifice. Out of nowhere, and only for the sake of previously non-existent tension, ol Chuck just had to fuck up his entire life for zero reasons. Nobody asked you for this rite of stoically unhappy passage sir. It was too much.This book was supposed to be a bloodthirsty shark and her grunting, broody nemesis. We got a minnow and a dude in a hoodie.She wasn’t really frigid, icy, or unfeeling at all. He wasn’t Roy Kent. He wore black once and I grunted more than he did. They had one semi-bad lunch two years ago that apparently made them rivals (it didn’t).I get that “underneath it all” she wasn’t supposed to be frigid or icy, but literally her exterior was just as nice and normal as her lukewarm inner self.✨Plot:He was an editor; she was an agent. He rejected a book (about an old man’s dog dying, fun!) she pitched. Two years pass and now that profound dog death book is a best seller. Her sister is having a Moment and wants to travel to the real town of this—thankfully—fictional dog death book. A book described as if that Sarah Machlaclan commercial just ended with a basket of dead puppies. The agent finds the editor is also in the obscure small town, a big *shock.*She shows him the die-puppy-die author’s most recent manuscript and it’s so good! brilliant! fucking amazing! perfect! for no reason at all because it’s frankly quite bad!(You really don’t get any actual details to turn the idea of that manuscript into a plot that makes sense so… gotta trust their Midas touches there I guess.)Since the author is *fragile,* frigid shark lady (?) must make sure the mean stormcloud dude (?) isn’t too mean. Yes the shark is actually being nice because she’s literally a nice person who rides a Peloton because she likes it. She was nothing at all like Margaret Tate—I love Margaret Tate. There’s nothing beneath the surface of either of the main characters, at least nothing intriguing. You get the basic plot points that check off the basic plot point list (including a great love for lists!). Her peloton is shoved so far down your throat you’re basically training for the Tour de France. The author seemed to think that owning a Peloton is the hallmark of a bitchy person so if she just! keeps! mentioning! pelofuckington! we’ll have to start to believe Nora is an unfeeling ice cube with thighs of steel.Of course, it’s really supposed to show us that nice people can be blonde and ride Pelotons too, but it was just… poorly done.I thought the concept was fun at the beginning: Nora is the Big City girlfriend that the Big City boyfriend in a Hallmark movie dumps for the Small Town baker/Christmas tree farm heiress/struggling bed and breakfast owner because the Big City girlfriend is too blonde and too toned from the stationary bike she wants to fuck more than him. Cool but just so… not about that at all? How can that character be so boring??? Nora never proved to me that she had ever been a poisonous bitch worthy of Bob Spaulding’s scorn. Although she did declare herself “Heathcliff”…but I also think she likes Heathcliff…so back to square one.✨Conclusion:By trying to subvert so many tropes, this book just reverted back to every other trope.Congratulations ya played yourself. I think parts were definitely meant to be tropey, butI don’t think the book really meant to be so wholly predictable and unsurprising.There was nothing about this book that would make me pick it up again or anything that makes it stand out from the crowd. The relationship was so…blah by the end. Maybe I’m the frigid wench because I felt nothing akin to warm and fuzzy.Again, I liked this book for a lot of the book, but that was basically allhinged on the assumption that the relationship would go somewhere interesting and I’d be naming him the honorary mayor of my vagina.Once it was clear I wasn’t going to let Charles anywhere near a large pair of ceremonial scissors, the shiny, bright ribbon fell away and I was pissed. All the small annoying things just snowballed into Heat Miser territory and I literally broke into a musical number. So sorry family.That emotional and romantic payoff ending (and the big “I love you” “prove it” scene) was sacrificed for pages and pages of Libby and her bookstore charity case.The relationship got like the last two pages. Of course, more than a few pages were devoted to their “gut-wrenching” but oh so “righteous” split up. I initially said this was Emily Henry’s most romancey romance but I take it back. It ended up being way more about Nora and Libby than about Nora and Charlie. It is evident in the scope of the ending.Just go watch The Proposal instead.⭐️⭐️.5/5 🌶🌶.75/5Spoilerish idfk: P.S. Really, when a character hasn’t cried for over a decade, there are certain expectations in a romance. Just saying. You don’t wait the whole book to cry and then cry over something other than the penis attached to the love of your life. You don’t make it your entire character trait and then wait until cry number four to cry over him. Ya just don’t.*Thank you to the publisher for an advanced review copy! I really thought we had one bois I really did.",2
511,Book Lovers,"Reading romances is ruining me, but I’ll never stop. Stories like these are too good to pass up.Something about the stories that Emily Henry that hits all the right places. This woman just knows what the fuck she’s doing.“It’s never taken effort—that’s what made me fall in love with reading: the instant floating sensation, the dissolution of real-world problems, every worry suddenly safely on the other side of some metaphysical surface.”————————————So, this is love…This is a 6 🌟 worthy read. Nothing less and everything more.My feelings towards this book are bordering on not normal. They’re intense.Anyone else experience slight breathing problems when they are *that* immersed in a story? Because the writing is so good and the characters are even good-er and you can’t wrap your mind around the fact that a story like this exists because of how well it speaks to you?Okay, I’m calming. I’m calming down.All I really knew going into this was that this was a book about books and I kept it that way intentionally. That’s all I needed to know. Partially because I like going into books somewhat blind but also because I trust Emily Henry to write a story that has all the right ingredients.And I was right. I got everything that I was expecting and wanted and way more! Once I reached the ending and closed up the book, I felt calm and rejuvenated and fulfilled.Thanks to all the crying.I can’t wait to reread this again. It’s reread-worthy.Thanks a million to Viking Books UK for sending me an ARC.————————————Books about books just hit different.“It follows literary agent Nora Stephens, a book-obsessed type-A go-getter who gives everything she has to her career but would really rather be the heroine of her own story.”I mean… 😍",5
512,Book Lovers,"Featured in this vlog:https://youtu.be/uXzba5_oHAMEmily Henry is an incredible talent and this book proves that she’s brilliant at writing nuanced protagonists with stunning romantic chemistry. Nora and Charlie were just pitch perfect together. I will however say that I think this book is poorly marketed by labeling this as “rivals to lovers” because they simply are not rivals. They barely know each other and have had a vaguely bad first meeting but that does not a rival make. But I digress, they were fantastic together and Charlie made me swoon so many times! I loved all of their scenes and their love confessions actually made me cry.If only the book was solely about them, however this book also focuses on Nora’s complex dynamic with her younger sister, Libby, and while I think that dynamic was well explored I personally simply did not care. It takes up so much of the narrative and so much mental space for Nora that her romance actually felt like a side plot to her relationship with Libby. The story just did not feel balanced particularly because it is marketed as a romance and her relationship with Charlie is not centralized nearly as much as her relationship with Libby.Also this book is incredibly meta and because the characters are in the publishing industry, they are hyper aware of the character archetypes and narrative tropes they fall into. Which is cute at first but felt a bit grating to me after a while.I’m conflicted, love Nora and Charlie, but I’m not sure I loved the book.3.5 stars",3

Emily Henry just has such a knack for writing books that feel like they were written specifically *for me* and I truly have yet to be disappointed. While I don’t know that this is my favorite of her novels (I love them all so much that it’s honestly kind of pointless to try to play favorites aside from writing this review lol), I am confident that the ending of this book is not only my favorite of her endings, but possibly one of my favorites book endings of all time? I read the last 50 pages twice and cried just as hard at the ending both times. I couldn't have dreamed up a better conclusion if I tried. Oh, also, Charlie is an absolute dream boat and I love love loved both him and Nora SO. FUCKING. MUCH.

515,Book Lovers,The writing and the characters. No. Was looking for a good read with good character development and good chemistry. One of those books which look like it was written in a hurry.And the cover could have been so much better 😩,2
516,Book Lovers,"I was disappointed byBook Lovers, here's a review in point form:• My biggest issue with this book is thatI simply didn't feel strongly about any of it.When I read a romance novel, I need to feelstronglyabout said romance--it can be a fun, lighthearted romance, or an angsty, hardhitting romance, but regardless of tone, all I want at the end of the day is to feel deeply invested in the characters' relationship. Needless to say, I didn't feel that way about Nora and Charlie.I didn't feel one way or the other about them, really. Their interactions werefine--and frankly, the worst thing aside from outright hating a romance is to think that it wasfine.Fineis boring; it's lukewarm; it's forgettable. (Unsurprisingly enough, I've already started to forget this book even though I literally finished it yesterday.)• As to why I thought the romance was mediocre, there are a lot of reasons. Namely, it wasn't developed slowly enough.There wasn't enough of a buildup, and the buildup is the best part of the romance: the tentativeness, the second-guessing yourself, the realization that you actuallylikethis person, the tension--all of that was missing here. With the exception of their first encounter, Nora and Charlie pretty much immediately hit it off, and, like, good for them, but it's not very interesting for me as a reader to just have all that fun buildup stuff almost entirely skipped over.• Emily Henry writes some really great banter in this (it's one of the few things I truly loved about this book), but banter does not a good story make, andthe overarching structure of the romantic plotline was lacking. It was too vanilla in that it just wasn't dramatic enough: there was very little conflict, or a sense of there being narrative ups and downs.There were inconveniences and half-truths and little misunderstandings, sure, but there was just no underlying sense of actually significant highs and lows in the story (at least with regard to the romantic plotline).•I feel like the whole time I was reading this, I was waiting for something to impress me--some ""wow"" moment that would stop me in my tracks--but it just never came.Part of that is the hype--a third Emily Henry romance!!!--and part of that was just my own expectations: I wasn't especially taken withBeach Read, but IlovedPeople We Meet on Vacation--structurally, it's one of the most well executed romances I've ever read--and I thought (or hoped) that Henry's stories were on an upward trajectory. Sadly, this was a major step down for me.It wasn't bad, but it was underwhelming,which ultimately means give it a couple of weeks and I will pretty much have completely forgotten about this book.• Some additional little gripes: first,the writing is overly sentimental sometimes, especially when Nora is waxing poetic about how much she loves New York and how much of a City Person she is. Like okay, we get it, you love the bodegas and trains or whatever, no need to tell us about it for the umpteenth time.• Second, as withBeach Read,the fictional novel that Henry makes up for this book--a novel that Nora's author client, Dusty, is in the process of writing--soundsawful.Like it truly sounds so bad, and the fact that the characters talk about it like it's a literary masterpiece that they simplyhaveto get their hands on boggled my mind.• And third, I found it really annoying how Nora constantly had to babysit Dusty. Nora's workaholic tendencies are a big part of the book, so it was surprising to me that this was never addressed in any way. Nora is fielding phone calls from this lady left and right to coddle her and give her pep talks and make sure she's doing okay and like!!! Sure it's your job to make sure your client feels supported and all, but the way that it's written here makes it sound like Nora is just there to manage Dusty's emotions 24/7. That's not part of your job, Nora !!!!!",3
517,Book Lovers,"I think my ranking of Book Lovers in the EH canon is 3rd out of the 5 that I've read. I was kicking and squealing at the banter, the writing was superb as always, and I really enjoyed reading the ""grumpy x grumpy"" dynamic which was very unique to the typical romance/WF novel. I didn't feel the same level of /completely understood/ as a person that i felt from the characters of January Andrews or Alex Nilson, but there were still definitely moments when I just started crying because certain lines were so me. I think audiences will love this just as much as they've loved Henry's prior two adult novels; it carries the same charm and authenticity that shines through the EH canon.",4
518,Book Lovers,"once i was sending a fr to a girl and her question was ‘which book girl are you?’ i thought of hundreds of books i’ve read and many characters that i adore sm but then i realised none of them was similar to me bc i couldn’t find a girl that i’m connected.. well till now bc i literally felt noratouching my soulin a level where none of the characters i’ve read so far did.honestly i can understand why many people don’t like this book bc it’s classified as a romance book but i don’t think it is?romance was like sub-plot, i felt like main topic that embroidered in it was nora’s relationships with the people in her life and trying to understand herself. i mean charlie is the love interest of this book but libby (sister of nora) was mentioned more than him. but i don’t think it makes the book worse bc every word that has been said and every decision that has been made by them was incredibly selfless, everyone is trying to give another a better life than their own andthey are tangled in this beautiful and sad madness🥹nora; the. love. i. have. for. this. woman. she is INCREDIBLYselfless, intelligent and strong. nora and libby lost their mother in a young age and since nora is the older one, she takes care of both of them ever since. when their mother passed away, she left school and started to work in two jobs to secure a life especially for libby. close to the end, libby got mad at her bc all she is focused was her job and she explained that the reason was not because she doesn’t have a life, but because she can’t bare the thought of losing the life that their mother wanted for them. she has to know that libby’s family is okay at all costs, and these made her a blade for people who don’t know her, cold and ruthless. this quote explains it so well;“That’s the thing about women. There’s no good way to be one. Wear your emotions on your sleeve and you’re hysterical. Keep them tucked away where your boyfriend doesn’t have to tend to them and you’re a heartless bitch.”there are things i adore from this woman other than her selfless behaviour, for example she can’t stand unorganised and broken things. she is constantly trying to make everything in order by preparing lists and fixing every broken thing and when she gets panicked or anxious she focuses on the things she can control, such as her lists. she has an incredible control over her emotions, she loves her tears bc they never disappoint her by showing up at crowded places.i even love her physical features, she is 180 cms tall and naturally have big foot. she is not tiny, she is not cute, she is not fragile andshe definitely doesn’t give a single fuck if you don’t like her opinion. she is cold to the people she’s not close to, she is protective over people who are valuable to her, she is strong af, she is professional and intelligent in her job. god please let me be her in my future years too🧎🏽‍♀️her journey of discovering herself was amazing, in the end she realised that she was thinking that she can control herself in a preterhuman level but actually she was holding her wishes back. and at the end ‘would my mother like this?’ turns into‘would i like this?’. and she eventually understand that loving someone doesn’t mean that you have to put them over yourself for your whole life, you can follow different paths and your love will never be gone;”Maybe it’s possible to have more than one home. Maybe it’s possible to belong in a hundred different ways to a hundred different people and places.”charlie; sigh. he is literally male version of nora and there was no option for me to not adore him too. even though his problems were different than nora’s, they practically have the same core, being ruthless and cold, valuing their jobs and fear of not being enough and wanted.he is so smart and elegant that you don’t even stand a chance to not to like him. he hates his town due to his childhood but still makes sacrifices by leaving the city he loved so much to help his parents save their bookshop. he never complained that his sister (who was supposed to take over the bookshop) found love in italy and moved there and made him the only person who is able to run the business even he despises everything in that place. he is selfless like nora, but it doesn’t show bc he always pushes his emotions back and whennora compared him to a cat? i died dead.nora & charlie; the sophistication. the intelligence. the banter. the communication. there is no single thing that i disliked about their relationship. because they are so similar to each other; the way they understand each other, the way they communicate, the way they can sense what the other needs.. i have never read a couple that has this healthy relationship in my life. i like sunshine x grumpy trope so much but i realised i’m a sucker for grumpy x grumpy 😭”How do you do that?”His brow furrows. “Do what?”“Say the right thing.”The corner of his mouth quirks. “No one thinks that.”“I do.”His lashes splay across his cheeks as his gaze drops.“Maybe I just say the right thing for you.”do you see this quote? it is the entire summary of this book;charlie feels not wanted in town by his family? nora asks him to stay there to show she wants him to.nora feels torn apart between her city and her love? charlie makes sure she is going back bc he knows she would be happier in nyc even though he is not there.there were so many scenes to prove this but i couldn’t take notes bc i was bawling my eyes out. the way they make fun of what will they write on nora’s headstone, charlie calling her a shark and loves her devilish smile, the way they outdo each other by their intelligence, nora trying to make charlie understand that his wishes are important too, charlie giving his flat and job to nora bc he won’t be able to go back, their constant trust and need for each other… they are made for each other;”So if you’re the ‘wrong kind of woman,’ then I’m the wrong kind of man.”and the way he talks about her;”You’re a fighter,” he says. “When you care about something, you won’t let anything fucking touch it. I’ve never met anyone who cares as much as you do. Do you know what most people would give to have someone like that in their life?””Just because not everyone gets you doesn't mean you’re wrong.“i loved everything about this book with all my heart. and thanks to emily henry for making us readers a part of this book too;”Nora.” He just barely smiles. “You’re in books. Of course you don’t have a life. None of us do. There’s always something too good to read.”*dies happily* 🥹sep 20:*nervous cough* i’m scared to write a review bc like.. 20 people told me they didn’t like this- rtc *writesinlowercase*sep 17:third time’s the charm, pls be the book that get me into the emily henry hype 🕯️🤞🏻",5

520,"Twisted Love (Twisted, #1)","2.75 stars✩⋆when i saw that this book has groveling, best friend's brother, grumpy/sunshine trope,touch her and i'll kill you,i hate everyone but you, a bed-sharing scene, great friend group, and revenge plan (???), i ran so fast and downloaded this real quick. plus, this was being hyped in booktok so might as well read it.i don't know why but this book just made me evaluate my life-myself. why do you ask? well,WARNING FOR NON ROMANCE READERS THIS ⤵ QUOTE IS SPICY OK BYE:""And your pussy is mine. Every inch of you belongs to me, and if you ever let another man touch you- he'll end up in pieces, and you'll end up tied to my bed and fucked in every hole until my name is the only one you remember. Do you understand?""and at first i was likebecause there's things you need to know about me when it comes to my taste for irl men:1.i hate bossy men (pls- i'm bossy enough as it is)2.toxic? i rebuke this negative energy.3.if you threaten to kill someone if they so much as touch me, therapy or 911?4.if you call me questionable nicknames while having sex, BYE ✋and normally, my attitude iswhy do menbut when i read this? i don't know myself anymore.i don't know what came over me but suddenly i... i um.. that quote above... i LiKe it... so if you know me, no you don't.but anyways, going back to the book, i like bothAva(h) andAlex(H) as individual characters. Alex is literally THE definition of a ""fictional character"" because that man is too perfect. basically, he has an IQ of 160, created a software thingy that made him a multimillionaire in high school and became the COO of a real estate agent development or something and has Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory aaand knows Krav Maga AAAND apparently fucks like a porn star? i-that's too much perfection ma'am.i thought Ava and her friend group were also fucking perfect because✧Bridgetis a literal princess (i'm not joking)✧Julesis jessica rabbit (??) apparently (also, fingers cross for a Jules and Josh book)✧Stellais this influencer who has 400k followers (???)can i be a part of this fictional friend group pls and thx.i thought the romance was cute in the beginning. usually, in a brother's best friend book the girl isalwayspining for the guy while the guy plays a martyr act and becomes a ho to ""push"" the girl away even though he has feelings for her. i'm glad that's not the case here and love the fact that Ava was even a little indifferent towards him at first. and honestly? the smut scenes were kinda hot.overall,this is a very chill book. at least for me. though there are sometw (spoilers) // parental deaths, violence, and child abuse-`,✎WHY NOT A HIGHER RATING?➳since uh, when?i really did think the romance and the wholeOperation Emotionthing in the beginning was cute, though, their feelings for one another went from 0 to 100 very fast because Alex really went from not caring that Ava was having a nightmare and acting all cold and ""heartless"" to:""She was mine. She just didn't know it yet. I hadn't known it myself until I saw her in Colton's arms and every instinct raged at me to tear her away. To claim what belonged to me.""i only sensed attraction but i didn't get the feeling they were already at the ""she's mine, he's mine"" stage. one chapter he's acting all nonchalant and cold and then in the next he “desires” her and tells us how badly he wants her and i was like bish when? most of the things he talked about in his pov was about his revenge and a little bit of attraction and with ava's pov it was all the operation emotion so them having intense feelings for one another felt kinda quick.their banter was cute the scenes were cute but personally it wasn’t enough for me to be convinced with his new macho man personality towards her. there wasn’t enough depth to be honest. like i didnt get the vibes he cared enough for her to call her “his” because even when he saw her having night terrors in the beginning, i got the vibes he didnt care for her that much and still acted like she was a nuisance.➳telling >>> showingwhen they got together after the first time they had sex there was a lot of telling >>> showing of how they are as a couple and that really bugs me because i'm the type of person who wants to knoweverything. apparently, they went on dates, alex was suddenly making jokes (?), and they talk through the night but because of the 0 to 100 energy and telling >>> showing, I. STILL. DONT. SEE. THEM. DOING. ALL. THAT. like- what do they even talk about?? and because of this, i wasn't really convinced with their “love”, i just didnt feel it becausei wantedallthe details of how they are as a couple and we didn't really get that. once they have sex, most of the romance were written in the inner monologue and it's mainly because the last half focused more on the revenge plot. also, even the the grovelling was telling >>> showing. noo, i need more.➳Viciousreincarnatedno, but everyone is right tho- i can definitely see the Vicious in Alex. he likes fucking classy women, has insomnia, and has a revenge plan that includes the heroine. i see no difference.➳OW dramadon't worry, it's nothing bad but i just find it icky when Alex says that the OW fucks like a porn star or when he was about to go on a ""date"" with the OW (don't worry, Ava ruined his plans) or when the OW says this to Ava's face:""Alex doesn’t do either of those things. It’s well known amongst a certain segment of D.C.’s female population. No kissing, no face-to-face contact during sex. But he will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars. Call you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut.""and then Ava thinks this is hot. personally, if someone says this to my face about the guy i'm into, i will dip because that's an ick for me (please blame my virgo sun and my high standards). you're telling me you're gonna fuck your girl the same way you've fucked your past hookups? ew no thx.-`,✎OVERALL THOUGHTSagain, i thought the romance was cute but it was just ok. the first half was full of cute moments but the last half kinda went down with all the telling >>> showing and i was kinda disappointed with the groveling because of this. like- you're just gonna describe how Alex has grovelled for a YEAR in just a page? no ma'am i want to seeeverything. also, i wanted more scenes of them of how they are as a couple because i just don't see Alex being all soft towards Ava.i'm excited for the next book, aka Bridget's book tho! i love the whole princess/bodyguard, forbidden trope. plus, her future mans name isRHYS. that name will forever be sacred so this fictional man who has the privilege of being named after that sacred name better live up to my high af standards.»»━━Twisted series━━««#1: twisted love— ava x alex ➳2.75 stars#2:twisted games— bridget x rhys ➳tbr#3:twisted hate— jules x josh ➳tbr#4:twisted lies— stella x christian ➳tbr",3
521,"Twisted Love (Twisted, #1)","OH BOYYYYYYY! LET'S GOOOOOOOOLet me hype myself up before I write this one.Another absurdly overhyped book. Everyone tells me this series is good and the later books are better. I don't doubt it. I don't think Ana is a bad writer, her writing is tolerable and sometimes even enjoyable.Can't say the same thing for her characters.NOTHINGin this book or even it's cover are congruent. Ana thought it would be fun to attemptevery single trope in the history of the universewith a single story, so you can't really tell if this is a romcom, a dark romance or just a joke.You get brother's best friend, neighbor, nightmare tropes, who did this to you, my parents died or tried to kill me, ex psycho boyfriend, billionaire CEO who doesn't date, grumpy-sunshine, family members who want to steal your money and not a single one of these were executed properly. I honestly felt like I was watching a Spanish telenovela.However, I HAVE TO MENTION thebesttrope of all. The one that brought tears to my eyes. The""I AM NOT LIKE OTHER GUYS!!!!!""but I will talk exactly like Christian Grey every time I get the chance. (so he kind is like one guy)Alex, our main character. CEO, billionaire, with an IQ of 190, hates beer, he is not scared of anything, not even bears. Won't kiss during sex, because he hates intimacy. He hates birthdays because everyone has one. He thinks everyone wants him for his magnificent shlong. He has been controlling his family's company since he was 14, because he was always knew he would be CEO one day and his uncle would listen to his 14 YEAR OLD DEMANDS. He also slut shames his own friends.IT IS LIKE I AM READING THE WORST TINDER BIO EVER WRITTEN.But yet quite possible to exist out there somewhere, the bio under some guy named Rey who lives in Florida and is a republican who hates women.He also says people feared him at 11, because his parents were killed and he swore revenge. It's like a wish version of Batman.Except Batman is actually cool.He apparently had a therapist after his parents died. Someone PLEASE GO TAKE THAT GUY'S license, because it obviously didn't work.Alex, and I quote:""Is not a TOY, so don't play with him unless you want to get hurt"" WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS WERE YOU PLAYING WITH WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD YOU PSYCOPATH.But yeah, Alex's broken record was to please: ""stop trying to humanize me, I am your bad guy."" He also guarantees people that""biological reactions can be mastered""Good fucking luck next time you have to sneeze BRO. Hope you don't fucking explodeOur female main character was the SUNSHINE OF THE PARTY! The most giggly adorable girl who apparently ""fucks like a porn star"" (this author had a really really really weird obsession with porn stars since she mentioned them not once, but four times during her entire book)Our FMC had her own mother try to drown her, then proceeded to kill herself from guilt. Her ex cheated on her multiple times, abused her physically BUT SHE IS SUUUUUUUUUCH A SUNSHINE and all she needs is to get dicked down to still see the good in people. Fuck therapy.It's so hilarious that in the desperate need to make this book a tiktok sensation... she added so many things that absolutely don't go together for the sake of hype, but guess what? Tiktok is that predictable.She succeeded.Now, moving on to the sex scenes. Probably the most hilarious thing I have ever read in my life. Christian Grey comparison aside, we get the most AMAZING LINES I HAVE EVER READ in my book blogger career.""I am turning you into my fuck doll""(?????????????? I mean if you want herunresponsive... I have something to tell ya...We might need to call you a new therapist, or maybe get you into jail.I haven't decided yet.)He literally describes the view of her on his bed as a:""sacrificial virgin waiting defilement""Every time she puts her hand on his dick, she""can feel the power it emanates"".I mean, by all means, put a cape on it and give it a marvel contract.Well, anyways... a bunch of stupid things happen, this book is MASSIVELY long for some UNKNOWN reason, just like Alex's penis. Near the end, our HEROOOOO threatens the mean girl to destroy HER company, because he has that sort of power, if she doesn't tell him where his girlfriend is. It has the same energy as:""my daddy is a lawyer""in third grade.It pains me to say this entire review constitutes of quotes from this book, because honestly? It's all I needed. It's embarrassing enough on it's own. I hardly did any work here.Maybe I will read the next one since you guys love it so much, let's see.Anyways, my stomach hurts from laughing.*wipes sweat off brows*",1

I FUCKING KNOW IT. it comes out july 29th btw",3
534,"Twisted Love (Twisted, #1)",Here me out: Alex kept talking about how Ava won’t be able to handle his “dark side” also referring to sex so I kind of expected him to be into idk maybe BDSM but nooo. He just liked other stuff than the missionary position. I expected more for how dramatic he was about it so I kind of laughed out loud when I read that.I also didn’t really like the way he talked and he would say the most random sexual phrases that made zero sense at that time so I just kept cringing when he talked.Let’s not even talk about that one specific scene… (cough y/n singing this is my fight song).Plot wise I was invested because of Ava’s past and I wanted to know about this fictional world but I didn’t personally vibe with the plot twist. It made sense but also not at all?,1

542,"Twisted Love (Twisted, #1)","2.5 - 3 stars.🔹Overall feelings:〰 Mmm this is honestly such a hard review to write because this was such a confusing reading experience for me. On one hand, I really liked this book but on the other, I really didn’t. I will try to be as thorough as I possibly can in this review so let’s get on with it...🔹What I liked:✏Characters:〰 Here’s the thing, I liked the characters, I really did. Both Ava and Alex were loveable and the side characters were also interesting and intriguing. I even liked Bridget and wasn’t bothered by the fact that she was aliteralprincess (which, granted, is utterly unbelievable but I still found that aspect to be amusing despite its utter incredulity).✏Tropes:〰 The writing style was good and the book literally had all the tropes that I usually adore (brother’s best friend, grumpy/sunshine pairing...) and they were actually well done.〰 I really liked the fact that Ava’s brother did not forgive Alex at the end. Honestly, I thought that was very realistic considering Alex’s betrayal of their friendship and the way he manipulated both Josh and Ava. I also found that aspect quite refresh since it leaves their friendship open for further development later on in the series (in Josh and Jules’ book).✏Representation:〰 We have a beautiful Asian heroine and a hero of Ukrainian descent, which we just love to see. I also really appreciated all the small details that the author included to help us learn more about the Chinese culture; that aspect was honestly well done and seamlessly integrated in the story.〰 The first half of the book was really entertaining and I was sure that this would become a very fun and quick read for me. The second half however is where things started to go south in my opinion and this is why...🔹What I did not like:✏Plot:〰 During the second half of the book I started getting the feeling that I was watching a bad soap opera. Things started becoming incredibly unbelievable and cheesy. For instance, the whole thing with Ava’s father was such a cliché that I was honestly surprised that none of the author’s beta readers had told her to cut out this “plot twist”. The writing in these instances also needed rework since they reinforced the feeling that I was watching a Disney villain giving his speech and congratulating himself on his wickedness. This is an example of what I mean:“Michael’s face remained anguished for several more seconds before it twisted and morphed into a hideous mask. His eyes gleamed with delighted malice, and his mouth spread into a mocking smile. [...] ‘Bravo’. He slow-clapped. ‘I almost had you,’ he told me. ‘You should’ve seen yourself’I swear, Mrs. James was real,’he mimicked, laughing.”〰 And don’t even get me started on how Micheal was the man who supposedly killed his parents only to find out that Alex’s uncle was actually behind the whole thing. I would genuinely be shocked if anyonewasshocked by this “turn of events”.✏Aspects of the writing style and characterization:〰 And this is what I personally think was my biggest issue with this book. The novel does an awful lot of ‘telling’ instead of ‘showing’. Both characters go from not knowing each other to being madly in love in a short amount of time. And the thing is? They’ve supposedly been seeing each other and getting to know each other for months by that point. But we as readers are only told of this passage of time instead of shown the moments that they spent together. This is not something that can work in a romance novel. We need to see the main characters slowly opening up to each other and starting to like each other in order for us to believe in their romance. This is why some romances that are set within the span of a single week work. Because its not about how many months the main characters have known each other, it’s about how valuable and detailed each interaction between the two is.〰 This happened once again when it came to the groveling aspect. A literalyearpasses in which the hero is supposedly groveling and begging the heroine to take him back. However, readers are once again not shown any part of said groveling. This is what I mean:“Alex and I had developed a new... well, I wasn’t sure if I could call it a friendship, but it was a step up from whatever we had when he arrived in London a year ago.”〰 Ummm, I’m sorry what? You can’t go from having the heroine say that she will never forgive the hero to having her say something like ‘Alex and I developed a friendship over the past year’. If you do that then you can’t expect your readers to believe in the legitimacy of said friendship because guess what (and I cannot stress this enough):👏Passage of time alone does not a convincing relationship make.👏We need to see the development between the characters in order to root for them because frankly? By that point I neither believed in Ava and Alex’s love nor did I believe in Alex’s remorse because I hadn’t been able to see him truly grovel. That said, I honestly hope that this aspect of the novel gets better in the second installment.🔹Final thoughts:〰 If you read any of my ‘pre-reading’ updates then you know that I had incredibly high expectations for this book. I had never read any of this author’s works before but this novel contained all of the tropes that I usually adore. The snippets that I saw on the author’s instagram page also reinforced my belief that this was definitely a book that I would enjoy. Hell, when I first added this on Goodreads it literally only had about 20 or 25 other people who had also added it (so I truly found it very early on). That said, while I wouldn’t necessarily say that I was disappointed or let down by the execution in this book (because, as I previously mentioned, I enjoyed many aspects of it), I will still say that I think many things needed rework and further editing.〰 Finally, I do think that I might read the sequel since I truly enjoyed the friendship group in here and I do think that this author has a lot of potential. So do I recommend this book? I think this could be the perfect example of a guilty pleasure read in my opinion. Many things needed to be done differently but this wasn’t a horrible read in any way.———————Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/rose_books2/—————————————————————————-PRE-READING UPDATES:———————-Ok but I just stalked the author’s instagram and now I’m pretty freaking excited about this😩———————-Mmmm I think I’m intriguedFr tho, gotta love the grumpy/sunshine trope loll.",3

549,"Twisted Love (Twisted, #1)",3.75 stars rounded up! A bit unrealistic and Alex definitely wouldn't be my time in real life BUT I still really enjoyed this book and I WILL be reading the rest of the series. This book is brothers best friend which is a trope I always love. And the way Alex would literally burn down the world for Ava is intense but also 😮‍💨😍. Alex is very possessive alpha male vibes thoooo so if you like that you'll love this book and if that's not your thing then this one probably isn't for you.,4
550,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","Update:It's been three months since i wrote this review and since then i've seen a lot of posts, and i've read a lot of reviews and my thoughts have changed to some extent so let me just mention some other things:- A lot of people have acccused me for ""still loving Rhysand"". I have not mentioned even once that i agree with what he did, that i agree with all the colonizing stuff whatever. My review solely focused on Nesta and Cassian. But for the sake of mentioning it: No i do not agree with what Rhysand did. I do not support him. I do not support his actions. And in my (personal) opinion, SJM gave his character a 180 degree turn from the man we all met and fell in love with in ACOMAF. A character i genuinely used to like, now forever destroyed. RIP.- And Rhysand should NOT be thehigh king that's plain colonization.- I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH THAT IT'S HIGH TIME SJM GIVE TAMLIN WHAT HE DESERVES. He has suffered, he isnot a tool, he is also ahuman beingfae. He made some horrible mistakes. So did Feyre, so did Rhys, so did everyone.SJM needs to stop making tam tam a punch bag.He doesn't deserve all this hate. He cannot be a plain white character. He can never be perfect. But he has suffered enough.- She needs to add POC or not so perfect characters by now. It's completely her choice but it's becoming tiring to read about ""TIME's 100 most beautiful people of all time"" all the time.- She needs to stop giving people SO MUCH POWERS idk it weirdly creeps me out.- Lucien. That's it. He shoudn't be a punch bag for the IC along with tam tam.---------------✨hardcore Nesta and Cassian fans need not engage. shoo !!✨She drew up short. “I’m not afraid of anything.”but you will be afraid of me when i rant about you. beach.Let me first answer a few questions to make you better understand whether you should read it or not.1. Will you like this book?This book is too character driven. If you like Nesta, if you can tolerate her bitchy behaviour and even applaud it AND if you can tolerate Cassian talking about his ahm parts every two pages AND if you can bear through the cringey sex talk then this book is definitely for you.2. What about side characters?We see them time and again but this book solely focuses on Nesta and Cassian. The side characters are just ... there. They don't play any special part. Altho we are introduced to some new characters but meh.3. Will you like the plot?The plot (for me) is nearly non existent. We are hyped up for it and then when the whole things plays it, it feels so dumb. If you like TOO character driven plots then this book is for you.4. Does Nesta redeem herself?If you call apologizing to everyone in the last 100 pages and can forgive what she did then yes. But for me no. She didn't redeem herself.5. Will you like the romance?Feysand is something superior. So don't expect that level of chemistry. I think it's less romance and more fun, sexy times (probably why i didn't like it).Now on to the point which is this book. oh this book. oh this damn freaking pathetic book. this has been: one of the worst experiences of my life. I'm freaking salty and i need a refund of my expectations.Let me make something clear. This book actually made me realize that i love the original trilogy a lot. likea lot. And along with this, it made me realize that Feyre is a pretty cool character. Better than both of her sisters actually.Now, what are the actual good things in this book you may askanything that is not Cassian and Nesta• MOR and LUCIEN 🥺🥺• AZRIEL MY SMOL BABY•oh my god NYX. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa my little babies have their own baby now i'm so proud. AND SJM DID THAT BGDFJKHGHDFJKG, PLS DEAR AUTHOR stop threatning their lives let them live happily and oh my god DID I MENTION THEY HAD A BABY 😭😭😭 and he said Feyre Darling and she told him no goodbyes Rhys *ugly crying*• the endThis book was entriely useless. Things this book has include:• cringey talk• Nesta and Cassian (what's their ship name?) scaring me to death.• bad writing (sorry SJM but it was BAD)• Nesta's inner fire blah blah• Nesta eating my brain•Cassian's cock rubbing against the seam of his pantsevery two pages (literally i'm not even joking)• bad sex• Nesta screaming about how she succs• mate• Nesta thinking she owns the world• everyone looking at Nesta and falling to their knees (hulk smash)• everyone looking at Nesta and sayingmother save youwtffffffff• Nesta getting a new superpower every 50 pages. i mean it. LITERALLY• NESTA AND CASSIAN BEING OH SO PRETTY• a lot of boring girl talk• Cassian and Nesta doing it everywhere• boring Nesta things which i skipped• Nesta being a bitch and apologizing in the last 50 pages or sth and everyone forgives herrrrrrrrrrrrrr• some boring side characters• an absolutely boring plotline• and as soon as things between Nesta and Cassian are resolved, the plot was dissolved into thin airBasically, this book sucked. badly. I wanted to crawl into a freaking hole and die. my eyes are literally bleeding from the amount of stupidity in this book.AND THE SIMILARITIES I CAN DRAW BETWEEN THIS BOOK AND ACOMAF(but let's be real ACOMAF is superior with a really good plotline, an actual love letter for people to heal, good chemistry, excellent characters and with an amazing ending).Nestaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. THE BITCH. She did nothing, nothing while Feyre provided for them AND STILL SHE BLAMES EVERY SINGLE PERSON. Like she was mad that Feyre found a new family but basically nesta did everything in her power to push Feyre out of the picture when they were human. I do get it that some people protect themselves by using angry words or whatever BUT to me she just seemed like aselfish bitch. And when everyone finally grew sick of her bullshit she's like: oh my god everyone hates me. yes i do. i do hate you. (Update:Someone told me i was being disrespectful towards people who suffer from PTSD. Well it certainly wasn't what i was saying but if, in anyway, my words have hurt you then I'm extremely sorry. BUT Nesta's PTSD doesn't justify her behaviour. Let me take an example from this book. Isn't tam-tam suffering from PTSD? But the way she treated him?! was that perfectly fine? The point is that this isn't only about her PTSD. She wasn't suffering from such a thing before going into the Cauldron. If you read ACOTAR from the beginning you'll see what kind of character Nesta was. If she treats other people suffering from depression like Feyre, Rhys, Tam-tam, oh the way she talks to Lucien then how can anyone even expect that i give her space - when she doesn't give that to others? )and just to show her ✨superior powers✨we are constantly told that:• Amren shivered (ohhh scary)• her power ... is death herself (dramatic much?)• Rhysand's face grew white (*eye roll*)• Mother save you all (okay but pls shut up with that line)and her POV was so boring, i could watch the grass grow or paint dry instead this. It was so bland after she had mentioned about 1000 times in only the first 200 pages thatshe is angry. okay we get it. Now stop. But sadly Nesta didn't stop. All she could think about was: Cassian's cock, how unworthy she is (for his cock),the fire within her wanting to bursttttttttttttttt or sth. ffs.and that pathetic chapter where: they are the cause of each other's release. R E L E A S E. ffffffsssss. and in a matter of few days Nesta goes from being a hardcore beach to being the prissy princess. color me unimpressed dude. it wasn't even 300 pages and she was already soooo much out of her character i can't even ---the girl said to Elain:“Spare me the bullshit, please.”I read in a review that Elain didn't try to help Nesta. SHE DID. she was there for her. but Ms. Prissy Princess was too into herself to see that. And then she kept raving about Elain choosing Feyre yeah yeah shut up.and she literally said Cassian tastes like crackling embers?? C R A C K L I N G E M B E R S. and then fire roared in her blood and there was an extremely cringey makeout scene after that. Oh the sex scenes were so cringey, i skipped them whole 😌✊and Cassian. oh the bastard. He makes such stupid jokes, and their is a single thought in his head: his cock. 👏👏👏 he has zero sense, idk why people even like him. his POV was soooooooooooooooooooooo boringgggggggggggggg and i was so sick of reading every two minutes that he wants to fuck Nesta OKAY WE GET IT NOW MOVE ON THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.and there is the non existent plot. ughhhhh something i was so interested about, but it wasn't given the attention it needed. Basically, everything that happened in the main plot was to give Nesta more superpowers *rolls eyes*I've said it before, i'll say it again. Mass is an amazing writer. I love her ToG series and ACOTAR trilogy as a whole. But you can't argue with the fact that Nesta is a pretty toxic character whose redeeming qualties came at about page 600+ and for me that's too late.Let's just hope the next book is A HUGE BOOK ABOUT AZRIEL because no one deserves it more than him 😭 Pls SJM give him the book he deserves.------------that cover is 2020 in the flesh",1
551,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","Spoilers hidden because I’m not a dickThis review gonna be a lili bit of raving about this book by itself VS ranting how it was as a continuation of Maas’s seriesHonestly, my biggest challenge going into this book was all my preconceptions of this world and its characters.The stakes were high.Cassianis one of the biggest favorites in the fandomWhereas Nesta has a reputation for being a....So going into it, the book was better when I tried to block out all the nasty shit in previous books and high expectations.This isn’t the start of a new ✨Maas✨series, just a standalone romance happening in same world.I highly recommend that mindset cuz then it's less disappointing. Moving on,꧁The Characters꧂I have never likedNesta Acheron. sorry not sorry. I didn’t like her much in the previous books but I acknowledge that her character has potential for such depth that Maas really tried to develop here.But did it work?Typically these characters dynamics would usually have me ✨screaming✨with a bloodthirsty heroine and spitfire cocky guy who always comes back for her!!I’ve always loved Cassian. But i didnt*quite*love his POV.I felt like thru an attempt of making his character more dimensional, we lost some of his key characteristics as the flirtatous badasswho uses humor and adrenaline to cope... Yes it was amazing getting insight into his thoughts and Maas’s writing style easily adopted this dual perspective. I just wish we got more of the Cassian that trained Freye and let her punch out as needed while cracking jokes at Rhysands expensive.Maas is known for her growling, purring, overprotective, asshole, alpha males. BUT I LOVEEE ITTTTAnd his relationship with Nesta was so well developed. He knows Nesta as a victim, killer, broken girl, self-sufficient woman, and general badass.He's seen it alll and he keeps coming back for her.Together, these two were the perfect combination fora hot chaotic relationshipthat had you swooning, cackling, and gasping.I don't think Nesta will ever be my fav characterhowever her story really speaks to mental health for someone who reacts/protects themselves with sharp words and angerSome describe Nesta as ambitious and authoritative character but to me she was veryselfish, cold, and distant. She did nothing to help Feyre provide for their family and spent the money Freye earned on frivolous items. THEN in fey world went on whole refusing to train/ help others but demanding they protect ONE of her sisters?!*fuck off*In this book, She*finally*had moments of -well i’m tired of not being able to protect myself. LIKE YES BITCH THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL BEEN SAYING THIS WHOLE TIMESo on that element, I was sooo glad she was actually making progress and decisions!At the same time, I found myself disappointed with the Inner Circle*gasp*I know, I was sad about it too. I understood why they were done with her shit. Because, same.But the constant bashing of Nesta's drinking, sex, and weight were low blows especially compared to the violence and weight loss Freyre went thru. hypocrites much? I fully recognize this isn’t reflective of the characters we knowbut its Nesta’s perspective of the charactersacting towards her...*Shrug*꧁The Maas Quality꧂Honestly, sad to report no major twists. It was just a really good, borderline dark, romance driven by character development and lottttasexy sexy fun timessince its not longer YAIf I had just randomly picked this up, then this book would’ve been off the charts with such dynamic characters, beautiful worldbuilding, and an okay plot.But in comparison with her others, this book seemed kinda basic and was missing some intricate detail plot twists that you usually can count on with Maas.To sum up it was an epic story of redemption-- Of a girl finding herself again after tragedy. And along the way she makes friends, and a lover who listens to her who supports her rough recovery, and not always her actions.Somehow this book felt soooo long and overly descriptive.. but also was not enough. No idea how that happens but there it is.The next threat/enemy makes logical sense. So I liked thatI wanted Nesta to get fierce FOR her sisters and be finally willing to fight FOR them. I lovesome badass sisters dynamicsof teasing each other, bitching at each other but would do anything for each other in the end!Didn't really quite get that.I was constantly underwhelmed by Nesta. She talks lotta shit but what has she actually done?She has continuously refused to show initiative in her own life and failed to provide for herself. Instead, she constantly chose to lean on the resources of others for her survival.All she has done is complain.Complainabout her human life while refusing to work and save herself or her sisters.Complainabout the happiness her lili sister found while refusing to be part of it.Complainabout the only people willing to fight and save humans while refusing to train or learn to fight FOR HERSELF.iM bOrEd and AnGeReD by the dismissive bullshit that defined her character up to this point in the seriesThis book showed some sparks of greatness! Taking initiative in her life! Using all that spitfire and backbone to make something for herself! But in the end, it kinda failed to live up to the fierce powerful Nesta I was hoping she would transform into.Reading this book you can’t help but compare to Maas’ other great heroines.I think the big difference is that Aelin always kept moving forward. And Bryce was a little shit. But Nesta handled her depression by freezing and becomingnasty.Which is just really hard to read sometimes.Overall, I’m glad I read this book but it won’t be a major re-read like most Maas books. The book stands on the friendship the characters build, Nesta overcoming her despair and FINALLY developing her interesting powers. I greatly enjoyed the character dynamics of how Cassian and Nesta are such strong complex characters, but I wanted their romance to be more epic and to sweep me away. I love this world and all the creatures and BADASS FEMALE WARRIORS but the plot was lacking and I hate the power change that a lot of Maas’ characters are undergoing.If you are teetering whether to read this book, I gotta tell you to lower your expectations and try to forget the bullshit of Nesta’s past in order to just fully enjoy this book. It was pretty great seeing the Inner Circle’s relationships in the aftermath of Wings and Ruin, especially through Nesta’s harsh eye that hardcore READS THESE BITCHES and all their flaws. Plus it gives some foreshadowing and builds excitement for which characters might be next.It was a good romance, but it wasn’t a great Maas book.ALSO I’M STIL FRIGGEN PISSED ABOUT THAT COVER-------------------------------------------------------------------------Pre-Book thoughtsI have never likedNesta.sorry not sorry. I didn’t like her much in the previous books but I acknowledge that her character does have potential for such depthSome describe Nesta as ambitious and authoritative character but to me she was veryselfish, cold, and distant. She did nothing to help Feyre provide for their family and spent the money Freye earned on frivolous items. THEN in fey world goes on whole refusing to train/ help others but demanding they protect ONE of her sisters?!*fuck off*Just the idea of a sister knowingly fucking over another in how she treated Freyre as human for YEARS ... it actually hurts my heart a little bit .... that kinda selfishnessBut Cassian liking her will probably MAKE me like her more*god i hope so cuz he deserves the best*I just sick of Nesta's unrelenting nastiness while also hoping she resolves her trauma and that Cassian finds the happiness he deservesWish listIt’d be kinda cool to find out that she was doing something—sacrificing—to help the familythat Freyre never knewback when they were humans behind the wallShe just needsSOME redeeming qualityfor all the times she constantly bitching and lashing out at everyone. Some reason for why the whole Cassian ignoring thing and treating her sis Feyre like dirt*shaking my fucking head*Also generally she way 2 protective and angry towards people for there not to be some sorta backstory or event behind it hahahCover:ehhh I not really a fan of this style... also don’t think it really suited for Cassian with the hardcore Autumn court theme and colors. This just seems like such a let-down and step-down compared to the artful creativity and beauty of Crescent City*frowny face*But its Maas so of courseeeee imma read it*duhhhh*",3
552,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","EDIT: this kind of blew up so I just wanted to say that if you're one of those people writing essays in the comment section to try to change my mind: I don't care lol 😭 good for you for being passionate about something but I'm not here to read a think piece on why you disagree, stream red velvet tho xThe following will contain major spoilers.Nobody is surprised. I knew absolutely nothing would make this book good, save SJM deciding not to write it altogether.Now, I have to make it clear upfront: IloveNesta. I really resonate with the way that she deals with her own emotions and is consequently treated by the people around her. That being said, I loathe SJM’s books. I only begrudgingly pushed through this for Nesta, and even that wasn’t worth it.Nothingcould have made this worth it.I’m not here to give a criticism of the plot or politics, because I’m sure nobody cares (I don’t). I’m also not here to judge the sex aspect of this book, although I know many people have chosen to critique that. Instead, I’d like to cover the three cardinal sins this book committed:respect, rebirth, and rhysand.RespectACOSF starts off with our heroine using drinking and sex as her coping mechanism. The third book in the ACOTAR trilogy left our main characters, especially Nesta, heavily traumatized. She witnessed her good-for-nothing father come back after he didnothingfor her or her sisters as children and try to fight Hybern. She watches as he dies in front of her. She watches as thousands of Illyrian soldiers die. She watches as Cassian is nearly killed multiple times in front of her. She’s underweight, depressed, has PTSD, and gets shit all because of it.No, in fact, she’spunishedfor it.The straw that broke the camels back is the fact that she spent 500 gold on beer and gambling. Now, the problem isn’t that she drank or gambled. It’s that she used this money-which is HILARIOUS considering that Rhysand owns five houses and pays each Inner circle member a salary that is so grotesquely huge it’s described in previous books as being more than they’ll ever need in their lifetimes. Rhysand is even completely fine with the fact that Velaris is full of so-called “slums” but oh, no, NESTA can’t be living in one! It’s fine if poor people exist, she’s just not allowed to be one of them because it’s “embarrassing” to them. Obviously, they cut her off completely, DESTROYED the entire neighborhood she lived in (has anyone wondered what the fuck happened to the other people living there lmao? are they just homeless now?), and ship her off to a sexist, homophobic war camp with the one person she doesn’t want to be around because being depressed is just /such/ a sin.She is repeatedly berated by every member in the court. Some lovely examples:>Cassian tells her that everyone “fucking hates (her)” and later makes this out to be “oh, I just said that but I didn’t really mean it.”>During one of their sex scenes she asks him if his friends won’t be angry with him for sleeping with her because she’s so aware of the fact that they hate her.>“Perhaps you can find it in yourself to try a little harder this year.”>He jokes that she might order him to kill himself, and she asks him if he really thinks she’s capable of that. Because this entire time they’ve made her feel like sheisa monster.>Mor tells her that she “never deserved the benefit of the doubt that good people like (Cassian) give her” and also says that she should be thrown into the court of nightmares. For anyone unaware, the court of nightmares is where her homophobic and abusive family is.>Amren constantly makes fun of her appearance and berates her for having sex. She tells her she looks awful at every opportunity, and always chalks it up to be because she sleeps around and drinks too much.>Rhysand gets his own section for abhorrent comments.There is no end to it. Every chapter brought a character insulting her for justexisting.Her weight problems are described fucking atrociously. The first time Cassian even sees her in the book he comments on how she’s “skin and bones” but guys, he still wants to tap that. Every time her weight is mentioned is either to insult her for starving herself because, need I remind you, she’s DEPRESSED, or it’s for Cassian to point out while he talks about how hot she is.All of this. All 768 pages of insult after insult after humiliation and pointless paragraphs forNestato apologize tothem.Because it’s /her/ fault she’s depressed. It’s /her/ fault she has PTSD. It’s /her/ fault and she needs to change for everyone else. Because everyone forced her to leave against her will because theylovedher, something they make sure to remind her of every single damn chapter. Nesta is disrespected by everyone throughout the entire book and is rewarded for it by being the one who must respect them instead.RebirthYou have no idea how excited I was back when I was an ACOTAR fan and Nesta was rebirthed as a High Fae and got her powers from the cauldron. It was like watching someone so similar to me-someone who was mean, and opinionated, andboldhold all the power in the world. I wanted to see how SJM would write her journey of becoming physically and mentally strong-of mastering her powers.We see glimpses of it. How her eyes shine with fire. How she sears the stairs she walks on with a single finger. The light emanating from her. The way she is single-handedly more powerful than Rhysand, who was said to be the strongest High Lord. It was incredible.And then she gave it all up.That’s it. Journey’s over. She gave up all of the power she had, but not before using it to mutate her pelvis so that she would be able to birth an Illyrian baby without dying.Yeah. That’s all.RhysandI have never met a character whom I loathe more than Rhysand. Perfect, feminist king Rhysand who loves giving women a choice so long as they pick the one he wants them to. He’s the most worthless, pathetic, egomaniac asshole I’ve ever read about. His name is mentioned 791 times, which is 791 times too many.It’s made very clear from the get-go that he hates Nesta. He’s aggressive toward her in a way that makes me want to strangle him every time he speaks. Every comment toward her or about her is an ill-intended remark.Nesta makes what he knows of him clear early on: “Any offering Rhysand threw her way was solely out of love for Feyre.”Wait for it, things are about to get comedic.When Nesta finds out about Feyre’s pregnancy, Rhysand looks at her threateningly, because of course he thinks she’s a danger to his kid. It says, “Rhysand was not only male, but a Fae male, and he would eliminate any threats to his mate and child.”Here comes the funny part—Absolutely hilarious to me that Rhysand wants to be the white vanilla king who loves women (and is definitely not misogynistic) and his wife SO MUCH that he hid from her the fact that her giving birth could potentially kill her.Oh yeah!Because wanting to protect your mate (gag) involves lying to her about her own body and child. He strictly forbids anyone tells her about it, so, naturally, Nesta tells her.Now, I’m not going to sit here and pretend like she had good intentions. She was just doing it to be an ass. But at least she told the god damn woman that the kid inside of her was going to KILL HER! And then, Feminist king Rhysand declared, and-I-quote, “Get Nesta out of this city. Right now. Before I fucking kill her.”Round of applause for our cracker saltine lord ruler Rhyse Hall, everybody.I have no other words. No words for how every single time Nesta dared to stand up to the awful way she was treated by him Cassian would get angry ather.As if Rhys was some infallible God who could do no wrong and must never be criticized. No matter how large his wrongdoing was, it was always her fault. Always her who was the problem.I just feel like...I don't know. I like Cassian, or I did, at least. I think that a good love interest should both support the heroine and call her out when she's being a dick, but relentlessly siding against her is just so ??? What's even the point? His entire family hates her guts, and he doesn't do much to make her think otherwise or to comfort her about it. He definitely doesn't act like he doesn't share some of their views. I don't see how a male lead placing his family over his girl could be very romantic?Concluding thoughts and my 13th reasonThis is the worst book Sarah J Maas has ever written, and that’s saying a lot. From her worthless white feminism to the complete and utter mind-numbing torture I had to face through this Bible-length tome, I could not have thought of a worse thing to read. It’s sad because I truly love Nesta Archeron so much, but this book made it evident that Sarah Janet hates her and wants to give her the worst story ever. Also, Feysand baby had a stupid name. SorryEDIT:frequently asked questions so that you can stop asking them:Why would you read something you know you'll hate?It's a free country! Why did you read this entire review if you knew you would hate it? (Yes, I /am/ a miserable person. I enjoy writing hate reviews. I think it's funny)It's a fiction book, it doesn't need to be realistic.By mistreating mental illness and eating disorders in fiction you perpetuate the idea in real life. The thing is, writing about something is not an endorsement, but neither is it a condemnation. SJM could have written about these situations in a way that was respectful, but, at least in my opinion, she completely missed the mark. I'm not saying she shouldn't have written about Nesta's mental health and weight issues. I'm saying that the way she wrote about them made it seem like they were just...her fault? Do you know what I mean? Like, as someone who has received comments about my weight many times, I felt deeply uncomfortable by how people treated her.If that's what you think then what do you think about... (enter character/ship I didn't mention)?I like Gwen? I don't have any further thoughts.Do you think having mental illness excuses someone to be a bad person?Mental illness is an explanation, not an excuse. It /explains/ why Nesta wants to be left alone. It /explains/ why she has a hard time being around anyone in the Inner Circle. It /explains/ her complicated feelings toward them. Nesta was already a mean person before this book—the actual question is whether or not any of her rude behaviorneedsto be excused in the first place. And that's for you to think on. Personally, I don't care.What Red Velvet song?All of them!",1
553,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","*This review contains no spoilers.*(very scared and had to edit my review after i pressed control + f and saw how many times i used the word ""fuck""). i have grammatically de-fucked this review. enjoy.)Ranting and RavingLet's get one thing clear: I am a hard core SJM fan. I have read and loved every book this woman has ever written. But can I be real a second? This book was shit, and I hated everything.CharactersI hatedevery single personin this book. Well, except Azriel (he can have me any day). But everyone else can die.I don't understand how you can make a fantastic, wonderful trilogy about love, friendship, healing, and everything beautiful in this world, and then come out with a disgusting, trashy, smutty ""romance"" that has absolutely no plot, shitty character growth,and an overall shitty book.Not to mention the cover. What is that, anyway??? An orange mask? A tiger?SJM took her perfectly developed characters and pretty much just let them rot. From the first three books, I loved every single person. Everyone. Now I hate Feyre. I hate Rhysand. I hate Cassian. I hate Amren. I hate Mor. For ** sake, IdespiseElain. Why is she a character? Why does sheexist? What does she add to the book? What role does she play, other than to collect people’s sympathy and make them feel sorry for her? I’m sorry (not), butElain is a ** idiot.I cannot STAND this hoe. Sarah, please write her death. I can't deal with her constant whining and bitching, running to Rhys and Cassian and telling them she wants to go back to the human world, just because Nesta was being nasty. Elain, you've been living with your sister your entire life, and you choosenowto complain about how much of a bitch she is? Where were you the past eighteen years? Please, sweetie, grow a spine.I loved Feyre and Rhysso much(note *past tense*). I would've done anything for them. Now I despise them with every atom in my body. The entire book is just themfucking, and Rhys bragging to Cassian that they’re fucking. And nowFeyre and Rhys have a childand now my life is over. I hated this book. I hated everything. Shit, have I mentioned that?Now, on to the next bitch of the month: Cassian. Why the ** do I hate Cassian now (who I ADORED in ACOTAR)? Well, for a simple question, there's an equally simple answer. Mostly because Cassian doesn't know how to keep his cock in his pants, and all he can think about is Nesta sUcKinG it and fUckInG it and doing whatever kinky shit they did that I can't even mention with a straight face. I hate you, Cassian. Ihateyou. Get me characters whose livesdon'trevolve around their OTP and who think about thingsotherthan fucking, bucking and yucking the love of their life. Which—not to mention—Cassian and Nesta don't even seem toloveeach other. It's all about the rElEaSe for them, because apparently, these fictional bitches have so much sexual tension that they can't help rubbing up on each other every twenty ** pages. Bye. Every one of you nasty lil bitches disgust me.Wait, you'restillnot done talking about the shitty characters? No bitch I'm really not, because I'm so angry at how many trees died for this pathetic book.So the next shitty character I’ll be talking about is none other than Amren the hoe and Mor the bird. I honestly feel a little bad talking shit about them just because I adored them so much in the trilogy, but this shit has got to be talked about.Heads-up to all those authors out there: when you are describing a character and how pOwErFuL they are, please. please.pleasedo not get other powerful characters to ""shiver"" or ""pale"" when they are around the character you want to MAKE powerful. It is the cringiest thing I have ever read in my life. It’s so painful. Come up with some unique way to describe their power and make readers admire them, NOT get powerful characters like Amren to ""shiver"" and Rhys to ""pale"" when they are around Nesta. I don't necessarilyhateMor and Amren, but they’ve become so ** irrelevant in the fourth book that there's really no point in talking about them anymore.Character ArcThe character growth in this book actually made me laugh. It was so minimal that it was astonishing. This shit is LAUGHABLE. It was just Nesta apologizing to everyone because she realized everyone ** hated her guts and she had no one to go to. How can apologies possibly show character growth? I agree, Nesta's bitchy behavior throughout the book was inexcusable. However, that was why I liked her.It would've been better if she continued being the bitchy little shit she was, but rushing her character growth towards the last 100 pages is stupid and inexcusable and straight up lazy, and it was a complete waste of my time.Love InterestNow let's get into why the ** I hate Rhysand's guts. Mind you, I used to love this hoe. I used to LOVE him. Like I would’ve died for him. Now? I’m just glad I was never faced with that decision. If I was in Prythian, I wouldn't even want to breathe the sameairas him.First of all, Rhysand is the only form of character growth in this entire book. I'm sorry, did I say character growth? I meant to say characterdepletion. Rhysand has accomplished it, y'all. He has accomplished his unbecoming. Where was that sweet, kind, playful man that healed Feyre and helped her and everyone around him? Where the ** did he go, because I sure couldn't find him.Rhysand is a ** jerk. Throughout the book he brags to Cassian about fucking Feyre nonstop. You have sentences like:""'Feyre initiated this round.' Cassian could hear the pure male satisfaction in Rhys' voice as he said it.""""I dismissed the maids bc I don't want them hearing what we're up to.""Cassian, laughing: ""Give the poor female a break""Rhysand: ""We're taking a break.For now."" (Did this bitch really just sayfor now?)But really though, why the FUCK is this necessary? Does Sarah J. Maas think it's attractive for a male to talk about his girlfriend like that? What has she done to perfectly amazing characters? I am confusion? And disappointment? Now he is an egotistical jerk, a typical overprotective alpha male (*coughs* did someone say Rowan? - I despised him in EoS), and a ** shitty ass friend. Bye, Rhys. You are cancelled and we arenotgetting a refund.I wouldn't go so far to say that ACOTAR was one of myfavorite fantasy seriesever, but it was definitely up there. Now, it is down there. Way down. I don't ever want to read about these thirsty whores ever again.PlotHold up, there was a ** plot? LMAOOOOOOO there was nothing in this book resembling anything of the sort. There was no plot whatsoever, to the point that there weren't even any plot holes. In order to have plot holes, you must havesomesemblance of a plot. I was justwaitingfor some crazy SJM shit to go down, for her to pull some astonishing bullshit on us, for some hoe to declare war on another hoe. But then the book just ended. And I was so confused. I didn't understand. I thought someone had ripped the last 200 pages from the back of my book. Alas, it was not my book's fault. It was the author's.Additional PointsI woke up at 9:38 AM to write this review because my hatred is overwhelming. I hate it. I hate everything. I wanted to die reading this. Nesta is oh-so-powerful because her power is ""pure death"", as Rhys puts it. I just ... I couldn't even. I couldn't stand this book. The only person that was tolerable in the slightest was Azriel, who I would let do anything to me if we're being honest. I love him so much, but everyone else in this book has turned shitty and disgusting. The other character who Isort oflike is Nesta, who everyone says is a selfish bitch, but that's really the only reason why I like her.I was going to reread ACOMAF and the rest of that damn series before I started this book, but now I can't even bring myself to, because then I'll just end up remembering the utter failure that was ACOSF. I'm not putting up with these characters anymore. Y'all can all die and I would laugh. Which is certainly a surprise, since I balled my eyes out when I thought Rhys was dead in ACOWAR. Now Imyselfwould brandish the knife on him. I’d gladly throw him in that ** cauldron while cackling and sit there watching that bitch burn (that sounds really evil and i should delete this sentence but i won’t because i’m feeling resentful and bitter)Overall, I hate this book with every ounce of sanity in my bones. If you're looking for a book with some steamy, smutty romance, then by all means, this might end up being your favorite book! But for those of us who have brains and who are sensible human beings and actually like to havecontentin a book, with likable characters, who like to have a plot driven story, just go home. Get your money back. Don't even get yourself hype about this book. I walked down that path, and honestly, there is no going back.And trust me, I know how popular SJM is. I can't scroll through the GR homepage without seeing some unsuspecting victim starting ACOSF. People probably won't stop talking about it for the next few months, which is unfortunate, because it's trash. I genuinely feel like this dumb shit is overshadowing some really top-tier books, so I'm going to redirect y'all to my favorite series of all time, An Ember in the Ashes. Read all four books, it'll do you some good, especially after shit like ACOSF fucks with your sanity. AEITA will put this trashy, slutty book to shameful tears.-1,000 starsCheck out my new blog",1
554,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","1 STAR.Nesta Acheron is the only interesting character that SJM has ever managed to write and yet she was treated like complete and utter shit throughout this whole book.THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF THE STORY BUT INSTEAD A DISCUSSION OF SJM’S HORRIBLE “FEMINISM” AND HOW SHE DID NESTA ARCHERON DIRTY.SPOILERS BELOW.I knew before even starting this book that I would dislike the journey that SJM had obviously planned for Nesta but I elected to power through because I genuinely liked Nesta’s character and she resonated with me on a personal level. I shouldn’t have.Within the first few chapters of this book, I was already infuriated beyond belief. Not even 20 pages into the damned thing and we have Cassian, who is worried about thin and unhealthy Nesta has gotten when he suddenly goes off on a mental tangent about her “magnificent breasts”. What the fuck? Unfortunately for us all, this is not even the worst thing to happen to Nesta in the first chapter. We are immediately greeted with Nesta being furiously slut-shamed by her once-friend Amren and our captain feminist Rhysand agrees.“ “Though I bet it’s hard to look good,” Amren went on, “when you’re out until the darkest hours of the night, drinking yourself stupid and fucking anything that comes your way.” … Rhys seemed inclined to agree with Amren. “It seems Rhysand, who is famous for always LETTING women have a choice, does not agree when it comes to women he doesn’t like. Furthermore, Amren’s blatant slut-shaming is brushed off;“ - did Nesta notice the faint glimmer of worry in Amren’s smoky eyes-understand how rare it was? ”Who literally gives a shit. I don’t care if this is the first time Amren has ever been concerned for someone, you don’t say that type of shit to your supposed friend.Poor Nesta is then evicted from her home and ordered into doing what Feyre and Captain Feminist Rhysand want or she will be forced into the human world where she has no place and would be shunned. Some sister, huh? Not only this but Feyre and Rhysand take it upon themselves to tear down a whole block of APARTMENTS where PEOPLE LIVE just because they don’t like that Nesta stays there. SJM has not even tried to stop her privilege from seeping through her characters and if I didn’t already loathe Rhysand I would most definitely be leading the mob to his door at this point. And so Nesta is forced to obey Mr “You always have a choice” Rhysand and attend training with Cassian.We’ll skip a few chapters; Cassian whines and lusts and does a remarkable performance as a “Nice Guy” tm until Nesta insults his precious perfect High Lord and he tells that her everybody hates her. Everybody. Now, it’s remarkably obvious to even the characters in this god forsaken story that Nesta has been struggling after the war (after all it was the supposed reason they sent her away) and yet dear old Cassian gets upset that Nesta doesn’t like his bitch of a High Lord and tells her that everyone hates her. Everyone, you can assume, includes her sisters and himself. This gets resolved in typical SJM style with a “I didn’t mean it, I was angry” apology that is literally faker than me in my online lectures.We move on to some sort of conflict and Rhysand and Co. decide to “ask” Nesta to do something incredibly dangerous, the last time she had done it resulted in the capture of her younger sister Elain. Of course, Nesta doesn’t exactly want to do that and so our quirky inner circle quickly remind her that her aforementioned sister can do instead. The sister that Nesta would die to protect, that one? Yeah. And so, our lovely little Nesta is once more forced into doing what President Feminist wants because her only other option is to sacrifice her sister’s safety. But yeah, you always have a choice, right?Speaking of choices… time for the big one.It’s revealed to us that our darling couple Feysand are with child, cue cheers! Except, the baby has wings and giving birth to him will probably kill Feyre. Rhysand obviously goes around and makes everyone swear not to tell Feyre for… reasons? Captain Choice not telling his wife, mate whatever, that the child she’s carrying will pretty much kill her? Feminism.Now, this stays a secret for a while until Nesta finds out that the glamorous Inner Circle have been discussing her and taking votes on what is or isn’t essential for her to know about her own powers. So, Nesta’s pissed (as she very well should be) and has a confrontation that leads to her telling Feyre the truth about her little fae baby. Shock horror, Rhysand isn’t pleased. In fact, I believe his exact words were:“Get Nesta out of this city. Right now … Before I fucking kill her.”Charmer.Sure, Nesta only told Feyre the truth because she was angry and wanted to hurt her, but I hardly think Nesta is the villain in this situation. Yet she’s treated like one by everyone except Feyre (this is perhaps the only time Feyre has shown some sense). Not only that, Rhysand literally threatens to kill her. When I tell you, I had to put this book down because I was SO INFURIATED, I could barely breathe. If a man ever did that shit to me, he’d be dead in a ditch. But unsurprisingly, SJM pins the blame on Nesta.When I tell you, I could rant about SJM’s purported “feminism” for hours I am not lying. This review could go on for another 20 pages if I wanted to. However, spending that much energy on SJM would be a new low, even for me. So, a wrap-up.A Court of Silver Flames is potentially the worst book I have ever read, especially in terms of character development. We start with Nesta, traumatised and lashing out, and what do we finish with? A Nesta who had to go and beg for everyone’s forgiveness and nobody, not once, apologised to her despite everything I’ve just discussed. I think maybe Feyre apologised once and Rhysand buys her dresses at the end like … are you SHITTING me?!Throughout this story, Nesta finds her own little group of friends and this is probably the only good thing about this stupid fucking book. Nesta’s friendship with two other women was surprisingly heart-warming at times and perhaps the only thing SJM did not screw up completely.This book was a complete and utter fucking monstrosity and I sincerely hope SJM never writes another book again.Fuck you,Allana",1
555,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","4.25 stars“So Nesta had become a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she'd found it had devoured her too.”I am irrationally annoyed by how much I enjoyed this.I read the reviews and was prepared to snicker my way through the purring, the ridiculous sex scenes, and constant assertions of ""my mate."" However *sigh* this series just does something to my cold cynical heart. I laugh at it, but I am incapable of hating it.So take my hand, lovelies. Let us venture into my detailed thoughts, which I have thoughtfully assembled into a list with no discernible pattern or theme:-Nesta is so bitchy sometimes. I get that it's complex and there's a certain feminism in portraying someone like her as a protagonist instead of a villain, but jeez, girl. Learn some basic manners. I occasionally wonder if SJM went too far in making Nesta the selfish stepsister in ACOTAR. It's hard to shake off that image. She does attempt to justify it in this book by explaining that Nesta was angry at her father for giving up and not providing for his daughters. Nesta was ready to let them all starve to prove a point-Rhys says to Nesta, “Of course you have a choice. You always have a choice here,” like he didn’t force Nesta out of her flat, force her to live in one of his residences where she can't leave, force her to train with Cassian, force her to work at the library, etc. Surely there are better ways to stage an intervention. I know they did it out of love, but Tamlin did what he did out of love, too-Speaking of, everyone hates Tamlin because he gave Nesta and Elain to the King of Hybern (which he did to save Feyre), but when Rhys threatens to kill Nesta if she hurts Feyre, that’s somehow okay.Nesta literally had to flee for her life after telling Feyre the truth about her pregnancy-Rhys and Feyre are supposedly equals, but he refuses to tell Feyre about the dangers of her pregnancy. Nesta is portrayed as the bad guy for telling her sister the truth-Can we stop worshiping Rhys now? Please?-I like that Nesta asks Cassian how he likes his blowjob. It normalizes communication during sex-SJM is too lazy to think of actual names for magical places and items. Under The Mountain sounds ominous if you think about it, but then there’s the Harp, the Mask, and the Crown-Ireally liked Nesta's character arc: her struggle with trauma and depression, her cold rage at her father for refusing to provide for them and the steel pride that prevents her for apologizing to Feyre for her past behavior, the self-loathing and insecurity, the female solidarity with other victims of sexual assault and misogyny. On that last note, I've never understood why Nesta and Elain were so upset with being being transformed into beautiful, powerful High Fae back during ACOWAR. SJM explains it more by linking the violent act of being forced inside the Cauldron and changed against her will with rape/sexual assault.-While I adore the themes mentioned above, SJM writes the same arc over and over. All of her female protagonists (Aelin, Feyre, that girl from House of Earth and Blood) wrestle with crippling depression at some point. She recycles plots and characters and writing phrases. Gets pretty old-The ending is thematically confusing.Nesta and her friends are thrown into the Illyrian Rite of Passage thing, which has traditionally forbidden female warriors because sexism. They get through it together without magic, symbolically smashing the patriarchy. This ties in with all the themes ACOSF has been pushing.Feyre's childbirth near the end is where it gets confusing. Both Feyre and her kid die, but Nesta saves them by stopping time and bargaining with Death (or the Cauldron, can't remember). She alters the shape of Feyre's pelvis so a kid with wings can pass through and transforms hers as well for her far-off future kid with Cassian. In exchange, Nesta gives up some of the power she took from the Cauldron, but gets to keep a little because God forbid a SJM character is anything less than overpowered.Thematically, the childbirth scene doesn't make sense in terms of the book's overall plot. What is the implication? That women have to sacrifice power in order to have kids? That doesn't fit the whole feminist angle.Maybe the scene can be interpreted as Nesta finally repairing her bond with Feyre? ASOSF has seen Nesta feeling disconnected from her family (guilt over her dead father, anger towards Elaine for supposedly turning her back on her, both rage and guilt regarding Feyre). Here, Nesta is restoring family by saving her sister and nephew's lives. She communes with the Mother, the harbringer of life. It contrasts her power of death, which is connected to her feelings of rage and desolation. Nesta believes she is too prickly to love, but through her hand (and better mental health), life blooms.That's a better interpretation than SJM had a baby in real life and wanted to work in motherhood somewhere. Also, Feyre has been resurrected twice now.

THIS MEANS, DON’T READ THE DAMN BOOK IF YOU DON’T WANT TO READ SMUT AND THEN RUN YOUR DAMN MOUTH! I DON’T READ MUCH SMUT, BUT I DAMN WELL KNEW IT WAS IN THE BOOK!! THIS BOOK MEANT A LOT TO ME FOR REASONS DOWN BELOW AND I’M TIRED OF ACCIDENTALLY SEEING A BIT OF CRAP REVIEWS. OH PLEASE, TAKE ME OFF YOUR FRIENDS LIST IF YOU DON’T LIKE WHAT I SAY SO IT WILL BE EASIER ON ME TO CLEAN MY FRIENDS LIST!! I’VE HAD IT WITH PEOPLE!! I WANT TO DEDICATE MY TIME TO RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS TO MY WONDERFUL REAL FRIENDS ON HERE AND IN LIFE. NOT WASTE TIME ON BOOK DRAMA!! (Funny how no one skimmed the smut they bitch about) 😉🤣😂😏My thoughts are wayyyy down below. And if anyone doesn’t like what I say or the book that I love so much or the author just go eff off! I don’t give a rats ass what you think. I’ve already deleted and blocked a person I didn’t particularly like their comment on my review so...😘This is a whole damn mood for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!When I read fantasy books I try to remember to put on my favorite YouTube music. It just sets the mood!https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6nRFaOF...In the beginningAnd in the endThere was DarknessAnd nothing more***I have this image coming from my UK woman on a booksleeve! 😏Nesta didn’t, couldn't, move as Cassian leaned in to whisper in her ear, ""The first time I saw that look on your face, you were still human. Still human, and I nearly went to my knees before you."" His breath caressed the shell of her ear and she couldn’t stop her eyes from fluttering shut. His smile brushed against her temple. ""Your power is a song, and one I’ve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta.""I didn’t have a clue how much I would love this damn book! It’s my favorite out of all of the series so far.I’ve been deeply hurt mentally and physically in my life. I used to be in a fighting school until my physical/medical shit has mostly taken things away from me. I have a couple real life girl friends, but nothing like this book, oh how I wish!! So, this book hit all of the feels for me!Nesta is an asshole, but she has some reasons with mental trauma - I can relate - I’ve got a lot of mental issues myself but not for the same reasons.I loved the fighting and strengthening scenes, I so much loved this in my life and miss it tremendously. I love the girl friends made and the girl empowerment in the book. These women went through hell!!I love Cassian so much. I love Nesta! I love all of the family and I love that damn house! Oh if I could have a house like that!!I love some of the things Sarah said in the acknowledgments.This book made me cry tears of sadness and happiness!The strength these women showed through the help of Nesta and Cas and Az were amazing. But ultimately they did it themselves. I love finding characters that are like this as I can try my hardest to be the same way. Among the many things I deal with I fight wanting to kill myself. It’s been really bad lately and I’m working with my doctors and my nature. These characters made me so happy, which I don’t have a lot of happiness and I’m so grateful. There’s only so much a person can hide about themselves trying to act all happy on the other side of the internet.Anyway, I loved this book dearly.And if it didn’t have enough action for you or was too smutty or written without certain characters and bullshit you wanted, f*ck off and write your own damn book and quit your damn bitching. I’m just sayin, I haven’t read any shit reviews and I won’t. I’m keeping to my own happiness of the book.Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾",5
557,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","No one is a bigger Nessian stan than me...so imagine my surprise at this rating.This reviewWILL CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERSso please read at your own risk if you haven't finished or picked up the book. But to adequately rant (like, truly rant) about all the ways this book didn't work for me we just need to air it all out without an vague mentions of what went down in this book.My biggest problem with this book started and ended with Rhys and Feyre. Y'all, I truly doNOTcare about them anymore. They had their time to shine and they did...so can we please move on? The second I read about Rhys having his shield up around Feyre so no one could detect her scent I was 1000% sure she was pregnant and pissed the fuck off because I knew somehow this was going to circle all the way back around them. And sure enough Rhys went off to be an absolute piece of garbage and not tell Feyre that she would die delivering their child since it had wings. So, when NestaFINALLYhas her big moment to show how much she's grown as a character it's overshadowed by Feyre going into labor and almost dying. Which pissed me off in itself, however, I made it 730 pages and nearly put this book down because of how triggering it was. A warning would have been nice instead of having to read about a lifeless child being born because some of us have actually been dealt that shitty card in life and would rather not have to relive those moments. I was truly ready to vomit and ended up having to skim those pages.Next up, and almost just as disappointing was the romance between Nesta and Cassian. I have loved them since day one and was so looking forward to watch their love story unravel. On one hand, I loved the physical aspect of it. SJM upped her smut game for sure in this one but that's pretty much where it ended. There was something major missing between the two of them that left me feeling next to nothing for them and all the tension between the two of them in the prior books was so far out the window. Truly a letdown and please don't even get me started on how abysmally underwhelming the ""mate"" reveal was.Third, was Nesta's growth. Just like I loved Nesta and Cassian together, I loved Nesta by herself. She's always been one of my favorite characters in this series even when she was a shitty person. So, I was always looking forward to the day when we would get Nesta's story because she needed a major glow up growth wise and usually SJM is really great at writing good, solid growth in her characters. But again, this fell so short that majority of it just seemed physical instead of mental. While I'm aware she has a lot of growing to do and this book was essentially her realizing that it leads me to wonder...did we really need 750 pages just to get to that point? I think not.The only, and when I say only I really mean it, thing I thoroughly enjoyed in this story was the ""Valkyrie"" training and the friendship that Nesta, Emerie, and Gywn had. I was flying through the part were the girls were thrown into the Blood Rite and cheering them on to make it all the way to the top of Ramiel. But that's basically it...and to get that little enjoyment in 750 pages is just a total fail for me.Of course, even though this book totally didn't cut it for me and left me beyond furious (Rhys & Feyre, I'm looking at you) I'm still a clown and will buy the next book when it comes out because I need to see what in the hell SJM is doing with these characters. Specifically Mor..why was she nonexistent this entire book? And Azriel... are him and Elain mates or not? Because I will riot if they are, he deserves so much more than miss garden girl.Okay, rant over 🙃",2
558,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","""So Nesta became a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she'd found it had devoured her, too.""Trigger warnings for depression, suicidal thoughts, sexual assault.Just out of respect for this book, I feel like I should be going through a mourning phase, sit with this story a little while longer and let it simmer, rather than trying to move on. I can't even begin to tell you how much of a therapeutic reading experience this was.It had all the SJM trademarks, great friendships, great emphasis on found families, great character development, and even greater sex. Of course.I'd call this Part 2 toA Court of Mist and Fury. It echoes that book very much in terms of the themes discussed such as severe depression and going through the process of healing from trauma, which she very much highlights is never linear.With Nesta that depression took on a different, more aggressive form:•	Nesta is a stone-cold bitch. I relate.•	Her anger was fierce. I relate.•	She pushed people away with her attitude. On purpose. I relate.•	Lack of self-worth. I relate.•	Extreme discomfort to emotions so anger is the easiest option. I relate.Do we see a pattern developing here?”Did she count–was she worth being counted? It was the question that sent everything crumpling inside her.”She had every right to be one (anyone that has carried this much anger and depression on their shoulders knows how much this weighs you down and debilitates you), though I initially hated how her anger would attack anyone that remotely showed any care. But your circumstances shape you. Trauma leaves an imprint. Hurt people hurt people. She was trapped in a vicious cycle of self-loathing and hatred and grief and it took a tremendous toll on her mental well-being. All due to her dysfunctional childhood, her body being invaded without permission and being thrust into a world she was conditioned to hate.I could write essays on Nesta’s character. I adore what Sarah J Maas did with this. There was so much attention to detail when it came to Nesta’s overall well-being, all which attributed to her growth and healing and it blew me away. It became about the little things, celebrating the small growths, embracing setbacks and moving forward in your own way and your own time.This is very much a character driven book, which is probably why I loved it so much. I’ll take that over plot any day, especially when it’s done well. However, there is a plot present. The world-building become even more epic in this book. It was so much more solid, since it was built upon from the other books in the series. I mean, that House? I want one!I didn’t want this book to end – it could’ve been longer. This almost felt like an extensive prologue. We just got to see the cusp of her capabilities asNestaand I’m craving more of her. It was incredible to see her personality come forth and shine through, behind all the layers she hid behind for so, so long.———————————————TITLE! 😭😭😭😭 I can’t believe we get to go back to this world again soon. And be with these characters.MY EMOTIONS!",5
559,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","All the Stars ⭐️✨⭐️✨⭐️I know a lot of people don't like her...but Nesta is my favorite ACoTAR character, and has been since the end of book one/beginning book two.I love female characters who are unashamedly prickly...who have defensive outer shells and soft inner cores...who secretlycarethat people don't like them...but also simultaneously don't give a shit.Ever since Maas has been dangling the Nesta/Cassian pairing in front of us like so much chocolate, I have been dying for the focus to be on them. And afterA Court of Frost and Starlight(which I also really enjoyed, although I know a lot of people didn't), I was basically pining for their story.Enter the announcement and wait for this book...the long, loooooooong wait...Then it came out and I inhaled it.

Seriously, this was so fucking good, I could cry, folks.Nesta's transformation was amazing...her and Cassian's transformation together was amazing...their banter was amazing...Rhy and Feyre as side characters were amazing...the main plot and all the sub plots were….amazing...I think I’ve officially used up the word “amazing” for the day, so I’ll move on.Simply put: I just loved everything about this book and enjoyed every single page.Also, Maas is not even pretending anymore, you guys. This book was NOT young/new adult. It was FULL-ONadult. And it was...fucking delicious.I'm already starting a re-read.",5
560,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","going into this book, it already had two strikes against it:strike 1- i hate nesta with every fibre of my beingstrike 2- i hate the mid-series cover change to something so low budgetso not a great start.but honestly, shame on me for doubting queen SJM.she took a character i hate and made me admire, sympathise, and root for her until the very end.i dont quite love nesta (i may forgive her nasty behaviour, but i will never forget it) and she wont be my favourite character any time soon (i wanted soooo much more feyre, rhys, and az), but wow. her character development, her growth, her understanding, her progression. its all a thing to behold.her story is something i think us readers needed, even if we didnt originally want it.and i love how good cassian is to and for her. i fully support them as a duo.so SJM did the impossible - she made like nesta. who would have thought.↠4.5 stars",5

566,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","Did I read this 757-page novel in one day?Yes.Do I have any regrets?No.This was my most anticipated book of the year, which is shocking.It's no secret that I don't like this series.ACOMAF and ACOWAR had basically no plot. Rhys and Feyre are annoying to me because they are perfect and have no flaws and that's boring. I literally could not care less about any of the other characters besides Nesta, Cassian, and Azriel. SJM also uses repetitive language, and I swear she gets paid per ellipsis. There are many things I don't like about these books.But dang it, are they entertaining! And I would be lying if I didn't say that I shipped Cassian and Nesta like I never have anyone before!I was so ready for this ship to sail. And now that it has, I gotta say, I'm disappointed. I wantedmore. I can't even tell you what I wanted more of. I just wanted more of it. I think I hyped this up in my mind so much that there was no way it could ever live up to it. I wasn't consumed by the romance the way I wanted to be.I wanted an epic love story and I didn't get one.The whole romance felt 'meh' to me, which sucks since it's the main reason I read this book. I wanted the angst, the longing, the pining, the yearning! You romance readers know what I'm talking about. Instead, I got a lot of sex scenes. And while I don't mind it, I wanted more romance than sex. It didn't live up to my expectations.I also liked but didn't love the characters. I used to love Nesta, and while I liked her growth and seeing her overcome her trauma, she didn'tfeellike the Nesta I liked so much in ACOWAR. Maybe it's just my disappointment, but she and Cassian felt off to me. Just slightly out of character when compared to what I'd seen before. Then again, people are different from different perspectives.Having seen it all before from Feyre's POV means that we got a biased, not necessarily accurate representation of who they are.That brings me to the fact that I actually liked the Inner Circle more in this book than before. I still don't love them and think they're all lowkey horrible in their own way, but I was more ok with them. Maybe because unlike Feyre, who saw them as perfect people who could do no wrong, Nesta isn't afraid to point out their flaws. Unfortunately, Cassian is blind to the fact that Rhys has flaws at all. It bothered me so much how angry and borderline violent he'd become whenever Nesta mentioned she didn't like Rhys. I also hated how Cassian was so unbothered when Rhys threatened to kill his mate. I kept waiting for Cass to stand up for Nesta in front of Rhys. It didn't happen. I don't know why everyone in this series insists on acting like Rhys is the greatest thing since sliced bread.All of that said,I did enjoy watching Nesta come into her own, and find happiness with her new friends. I also loved Nesta's relationship with the House. The House and Nesta is a friendship I didn't know I needed. By far the best relationship in the book.!!!THE FOLLOWING IS A SPOILER!!!I hate that Nesta had to lose her power. She was death incarnate and could wield insanely powerful objects as no one else could. Then it was taken away. It's like SJM didn't want her to be a match to the ever-perfect and powerful Rhys. Same with Amren in ACOWAR. Why can't powerful women stay powerful? Also, while I'm all for girl power, Nesta and her friends shouldn't have won the Blood Rite. How do girls who have been training for three months win against warriors that have been training for years? It makes no sense.!!!SPOILER OVER!!!Also, this had a weak plot.All of the books in this series do if I'm honest. It's definitely a character-focused novel. The plot feels distant from the story. It's worse because the plot of this is very obviously a setup to other novels. The villain in this story was irrelevant, they didn't even make an appearance until the end.It feels like the introductory book in a series,which I suppose it is, but I still didn't like it. This made the book feel longer than it was, and it was already pretty gosh darn long (not that it stopped me from reading it in one go).Overall, this book was OK. Nothing more. Nothing less. I am still eagerly awaiting Azriel's book.Also!! Apparently, Feyre doesn't suck at painting! Shocking right! This is the first time that her paintings were described in detail and people actually commented on their beauty rather than just vaguely acknowledging them. In my mind she still sucks though.Ok, now I'm about to get controversial. Don't come for me, I don't have the energy for it.Apparently, all the SJM haters have been bullying people for buying this book because it's not diverse enough? WTF.If you don't want to read this book, don't. If you don't want to buy this book, don't. If you're mad because the author is writing the story she wants with the characters she wants, go read other books. It's truly that simple.Don't bully people for spending their money how they want and for reading what they want. As far as I know, Sarah J. Maas hasn't disrespected anyone in her books. Sure, her books are hella white. But if it bothers you, go read more diverse books. Don't be an asshole to people who want to read this. And don't be a hypocrite and tell people that you don't support the story but then say you're gonna pirate it because you're still interested in reading it.Read it or don't. That's all there is to it.- Sincerely, a person of color who is entirely impartial toward SJM",3
567,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","Edit:As much as I loved the romance and smut in the book, I don’t understand how it won in the Fantasy category. It’s so unfair to the other books :((Quick Warning:Have an aspirin handy because what goes down in this book will mess with your heart.Reading this book felt like having a cold breeze brush my face after being out in the hot sun; of honey-ginger tea making its way down my sore throat. It gave me an adrenaline rush I don't think even confronting a Polar Bear would've given me.This book was definitely flawed and I wasn’t a huge fan of the plot (if there was one). Nesta and Cassian’s relationship however was like a weightless joy. Every conversation, every emotion had so much depth and every character grew in their own roundabout way.This book highlights the ramifications of the War with Hybern- Nesta's trauma and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. After losing her mother at a very young age, having to watch her father's neck being snapped right after he told her how much he loved her, being turned into a High Fae against her will, and the pain of almost losing her sister Elaine, broke something in her. Everybody has their own way of dealing with trauma. Nesta deals with it by building an invisible wall around herself and pushing away the people that love her the most by hurting them with her acid words.As she embarks on a journey towards self-development, she finds that the only one who can decimate the wall around her isCassian- A fierce Illyrian warrior and the General Commander of the Night Court.As her wall keeps degenerating over time, a deliciously romantic and sex-drenched relationship develops between them. There's obviously LOTS of steamy, ragingly passionate scenes but what is most appealing in their relationship is the minor displays of affection and the respect they have for each other and will set your soul on fire.They each challenge the status quo and reveal themselves to be stronger than anyone imagined through rigorous training and practice.I love howSarah J Maasredeemed Nesta's character in tiny steps and not like how she redeemed Rhysand in ACoMaF. Nesta's journey toward self-love wasn't smooth. She kept falling down, picking herself back up only to realize she fell deeper. This falling-down-climbing-back-up-thing went on for a while and it was so raw and real that my tear glands vowed to empty every drop from my body.For all those who hate Nesta after reading ACoFaS, let me tell you: I come from the same place. But do not let that stop you from reading this book because what's the worse that can happen, hmm? You will either hate it in which case you can always DNF it or get back to it later. But if you love it, then there's no stopping you from jumping around like a maniac. But if you don't even try, you will never know, will you?",3

569,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","First Read:5 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Second Read:5 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️It feels like coming home after a long journey.That is precisely what I feel whenever I read aSarah J Maasbook. WhileThrone of Glassis my favorite series butACOTARis special to me. It helped me during one of the most difficult periods of my life and in particular,ACOMAF.I have no words to describe the beautiful familiarity of returning to a world you know you have always missed.I swear I could almost feel the gentle breeze of Velaris caressing me, welcoming me back while knowing that the story will start from a very dark place.Because this isNesta'sstory.In the beginningAnd in the endThere was DarknessAnd nothing more.I will be writing two sections of the review soon:• a non-spoiler section that will come first• a spoiler section because I DO need to highlight some points.----------Non-spoiler review----------Nesta'shealing journey was not a smooth one. I did not expect it to be. She clawed her way out of the the darkness that engulfed her ever since she had turned into a Fae.For her to heal, Nesta had to rip her soul apart to find her self again.I will tell you that I disliked Nesta so much in the ACOTAR books, I just kept a tight hold on the grudge against her.But Nesta is not a person that was meant to be liked. She is vicious and her sharpest weapon has always been her tongue. She could inflict a wound so deep with a mere word. But I came to realizeNesta is the most ""human"" character among all of them.Humanity does not equal good morals necessarily, Nesta is heavily flawed and her flaws are what makes her human.She is guilt-ridden to the point she allows her guilt to rot within her, poisoning most of the traits that makes her a good person. She carries such a deep disdain towards herself that she acts on it and you often see it in the form of lashing words.Why does she allow this to happen to her? Because she holds onto one belief:She deserves it.When I started seeing Nesta's soul more clearly after she began to tear it open, I felt my soul resonate with hers to the point that I cried.She was a prisoner in her own head, reliving certain deaths and nightmares that she can no longer see the light in the world. She can no longer see the goodness in her.It was powerful. It was raw. It was ugly.It was devastatingly beautiful in a way.That is what Nesta's healing looked like. She was such a damaged person inside that she gave up on the hope of healing herself.Does that mean all is forgotten about Nesta's past behavior? About the fact that she hurt and wronged many people? That she at many moments was a horrid person?The answer is No, and this is what makes Nesta's healing journey so impactful and emotional.Her trauma after the Cauldron and the War wrapped its adamant chains around her. The devastating war still haunts her and pulls her back from that light at the end of the tunnel where her family await her, a family that are bent on believing that she chose to remain in the darkness.No one was willing to go deep into the darkness to her and gift her a fragment of light that will guide her steps out.No one was willing to go as far as to shatter those chains and spare her from that misery.No one except forCassian.Nesta and Cassian's romance was maddening, passionate and wild.They were feral with each other, they were mad for one another, they were perfect for each other. I expected no less of them.Sarah J Maaswas not kidding when she mentioned that this was the filthiest book she has written so far.I was very impressed with her writing style, I really enjoy seeing an author's journey throughout the years and how much they grow. Of course, ACOSF comes with its own set of flaws and issues but it does not ruin the overall experience for me.If it shredded my emotions, if it made me cry, if my heart felt attached to this world after turning the very last page. It deserves a 5-star rating from me regardless of the issues and flaws that I will highlight in the spoiler section.Not to mention now that I adore Nesta, I adore the person she had become in the end and this is coming from a person that never liked her in the previous books.A Court of Silver Flamesis sexy, emotionally gripping and powerful.WARNINGI will go into detail about the book in the other section of this review below which will contain MAJOR SPOILERS, so please this is a heads up for those that have not read the books to not continue further unless they are willing to be spoiled.--------MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD--------Spoiler-review:The following review will be summed up in points because this is the best way to sort my thoughts and make sure I left nothing out.Yes people I am about to let it all out.Also, this is my own experience and my opinion should not be treated as a fact. To each of us their own unique reading experiences. I do not want to ruin anyone's experience and I do not want someone to ruin mine.So, let's get on with it!*ACOSF'sbackbone wasNestaand her found family:Gwyn and Emerie. I adore their precious bond and the fact that they are badass female characters whom are also passionate readers of smutty romances. I love that Nesta found other friends outside the IC, they all found something in each other and helped one another heal.* TheHouseis my new favorite character.* Unpopular opinion but I am glad to seeRhysandplaying the High Lord role. Of course we'd find him to be more broody since we are no longer seeing him fromFeyre'sperspective, we are seeing him in his true element. I've noticed that a few readers said they didn't like Rhys in this book, well.. Rhysand isn't the epitome of perfection many make him out to be and I appreciate that because he is heavily flawed too and yes I do like Rhysand.* My heart bursts with so much love forCassian! He wasn't without flaws too but I finally saw the raw version of him.* Although I was in no rush to seeFeyre'spregnancy, yet it warmed my heart because Feyre deserves that kind of happiness after everything she went through. Of course I cried when she announced that she was pregnant I already suspected it early on.* It's refreshing to see theInner Circlefrom two other perspectives especially Nesta's and their treatment of her as if she was a hopeless case. Not saying that Nesta wasn't at fault here but they too are not cutting her some slack.* I think in regards to theromanceI have a few things I want to address: there were some romantic scenes that felt repetitive from ACOMAF + the intimate scenes were sometimes spicy in a good way and sometimes sloppy with weird descriptions.* I loved seeingNesta'sgrowth because it was beautiful and ugly at the same time and you can easily notice the shifting points in her healing.* I rolled my eyes at theNessianmating bond, sorry everyone. I let it slip because I grew fond of them both but I do not want the romance to always be attached to some invisible bond. It's supposed to be rare we already had that with Rhys and Feyre.* Theplotdid not feel stable, it felt like it went to so many different directions. I was kind of hoping there would be more politics and human queens involved but it's not like I wasn't happy to where it ended up.* I was missing the open-conversation I was looking forward to between Nesta and the Inner Circle, both acknowledging their wrongs.* The rareRed starblasting through the sky that rattled Rhys, freaked out Cassian and the Priesstesses is none other thanAelin!.* Can we talk about the fact thatHelionwanted to enter the Night Court in a Golden Chariot led by four white horses with manes of golden fire and Rhys was like no so he settled for a Pegasus still having the best entrance of any character in the book.* the whole High King situation is a big No No. I love the dynamic of the Seasonal and Solar Courts and that what makes Prythian unique. Making Rhys a High King would ruin that and the fact that each Court is associated with its High Lord's power. I've had it with Rhys beingthe most powerful high lord in historyso I do not need him to be upgraded to a High King especially not with using weapons that are the products of Nesta's power. That's giving Rhys way more power.* The scene that hit me the most was when Nesta let it all out. I cried because I am familiar with that level of self-loath.* I cried at the scene when Feyre was giving birth, it was intense and so emotional. Deep down I knew SJM wouldn't just end it here but it did not stop my heart from breaking.* The aftermath was so precious.* I do not mind thatNestalost the power she took from the Cauldron. She will lead the Valkyries whom she revived with her two other friends. She will grow even stronger without relying on powerful magic that makes her a target of other enemies. Her power has been a heavy weight lifted off her shoulders, and she gave them away in the most emotional and beautiful way.* Unpopular opinion: I have no issues withAzriel's POVbecause this is the first time we are exposed to his thoughts and he definitely was not OOC. Azriel is not some dark cinnamon roll, he is a deep inner turmoil. I find his notion of love and thoughts of Elain to be unhealthy. He has no experience with love besides the 500 year old unrequited love for Mor which brings me to ask... how come Az would get over Mor, his 500 year old crush just for Elain? They have not even spoken about their feelings. Anyhow, I do believe Azriel to be at a very dark place and it saddens me that many readers disliked him after this. Azriel has always kept to himself, he was never brought into the light, he does not know what love truly is. Having an Archeron sister does not guarantee the happiness his brothers found, this is a very wrong mindset.* Yes, I've said it before and I'll say it again:Azrielneeds a ray of sunshine kind of character and we find that inGwyn. I think she is perfect for him and there is a reason SJM gave her the spotlight in his POV. Her name literally means happiness, blessing, white, fair while Az's is God is my help and Azrael the Angel of Death. Such a stark contrast, like yin and yang.* I hope SJM won't useGwyn, a SA survivor, as a plot-device for Elriel and then discard her that is too cruel.* Yes, not all Illyrian brothers should end up with every Archeron sister so I'll be rooting for Azriel and Gwyn in the next book.* Also, many people calledRhysa hypocrite for his actions with Azriel. No, what he did makes sense and he is pulling rank because this is how Rhys asserts his role as High Lord with a responsibility toward his court. Az ignored the Mor question, Az did not express his love or feelings towards Elain only his desire to have her and I'm pretty sure there would've been a different reaction from Rhys if Az told him that he genuinely loves her. With a baby on the way, Rhys won't risk any more conflicts that targets him and his family nor will he risk alliances with the other courts because of Azriel. How many times throughout the books did Rhys ask something of Azriel like to stop spying or not engage in a battle and he refuses until Rhys pulls the High Lord act on him and tells him that's it's anorder, people forget how stubborn Azriel can be.* I appreciate the fact that this book gave us a new perspective to theInner Circleand their flaws. I still adore them.I may add points later on, I'm not quite sure I covered everything but I hope I did.Another note I would add is please be careful with posting spoilers in the comments. Try to be vague about it because it will still show on Goodreads feed to other readers that haven't read the book.Remember that this is my own personal experience of the book and my own personal opinions that in no way invalidate your own, so please do not invalidate mine if you do not agree with it.ACOMAF remains at the top but ACOSF managed to take over the second place, I will definitely be rereading it some time in the future.This is the longest review I have written so far, so thank you for sticking around.",5
570,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","“Forgiveness is not that easy.”“Forgiveness is something we also grant ourselves.”So did I really wait three years for ACOSF only to binge read it in 14 hours with 0 sleep? Yeah I did and it wasso worth it.And before you start looking for it in this review, yes we find out what was in the box and yes we find out if they are mates or not but no I will NOT spoil those in this review. I also included links to the bonus scenes at the bottom.SPOILERS BELOWSo I’m just gonna go ahead and say SJM fed us so good after almost three years! So many theories were proven and the filler chapters were giving me life. It’s perfect for those who’ve followed her series as they come out and have had to endure the torturous wait for more.But first thing’s first:what thehellhappened to the conflict that was building up in ACOFAS?I can’t have been the only one bamboozled with the way Sarah conveniently just resolved The One Big Thing that could have been the center of ACOSF. You should’ve seen my face when Cassian mentioned that Kallon DIED IN THE PREVIOUS RITE without a fuss. Like? What? Isn’t…that… why… we’re here…. ? No? Okay?And alsowhat happened to the “You’re coming with me to the Illyrian Mountains” bit?Again, another misdirection (for lack of a better word) on what we were expecting ACOSF to be. Soooo many people, me included, were expecting Nesta to move in with Cassian in a small cottage to actually live in the Windhaven Camp! I’m actually pretty sad that that didn’t come to pass BUT I’m not complaining with how things turned out.WITH THAT SAID;1. Put simply, the wait was worth it.I loved this book.I loved the plot.I loved NessianI loved the smut!!!!!!I loved the House of Wind.I loved Eris.I loved MOR (I know I’m surprised at how that turned out too).I loved Azriel-the-chaperone!“You two need a chaperone up here?”Yes. No. Yes. “I thought you were the chaperone.”Az threw him a wicked smile. “I’m not entirely sure I’m enough.”The full quote is even better than I could have hoped for!2. Another thing I love about ACOSF was the passage of time!The entire book spans about a little over a year, which justifies the crazy amount of events that happen in this behemoth of a book.Remember when the entire TOG series was said to have happened in onlyone year? Yeah I didn’t like that.3. I have a feeling that the red star that shot through the sky was Aelin falling through Prythian in KOA!PLEASE TELL ME YOU GUYS SAW IT TOO.“The mood hadn’t been helped by a rare red star blasting across the sky one day—an ill omen, Nesta had heard the priestesses muttering. Cassian reported that even Rhys had been rattled by it, seeming unusually contemplative afterward. But Nesta suspected that the omen wasn’t the only thing contributing to Rhys’s solemnity. Feyre was only two months from giving birth, and they still knew nothing about how to save her.”4. I’m just gonna take a minute here to talk about the smut.So ACOSF is officially an adult book and it shows in the smut! There is so much of it and I have only one complaint - that SJM did not flesh out a particular 34+35 scene. She no longer uses her oh-so-famous “velvet wrapped steel” innuendos. We go straight to the point with “cock” and even the word “cunt” now.It also goes without saying that the smut is decidedly more intense than what we've seen from her previous books. SJM was not kidding at all when she said she's descended into new levels of filthy when writing ACOSF.I did, however, still have some slight issues with the bookFor one, I didnotlove how Feysand hijacked certain parts of this book *cough cough the ending cough cough* It’s a Nessian book and yet Feysand is still the center of their world. No, I’m living in Nesta’s world. I want it to be all about her!I also had a slight disconnect with Nesta’s character although I can’t tell if she was acting out of character or if she was just grossly misrepresented in books 1-3 since we read it from Feyre’s POV. Nevertheless, I still love how she arced as a character and how she healed.START MAJOR SPOILERS SECTIONEnding spoilerI’m very sad that Nesta pulled an Aelin and lost majority of her powers in the end. I loved powerful!Nesta. I loved that everyone was afraid of her. I loved that she was rewriting Prythian history by merely existing. Gods that are older than Prythian itself were afraid of her. I hate how she gave that up in the end. What is it with women being rendered powerless in these books (Aelin and Amren)?Nesta spoilerI am also upset that Nesta ended up melding back with the IC? Everyone was expecting her to move out to Illyria and have her own family outside of the Night Court - I wanted that for her too. But, oh well.Azriel POV spoiler (Bonus scenehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folder...)I’m SO excited to see where his story goes. I’m not a heavy shipper for Elriel or Moriel or Azgwyn (??) but I’m interested to see who gets to be with Azriel in the end!Feysand POV spoiler (Bonus scenehttps://www.reddit.com/r/acotar/comme...ORhttps://wetransfer.com/downloads/abec...)THAT TEASER OF RHYSAND’S LAST NAME??? GIVE IT TO US SARAH WE ARE SO CLOSE.Generic spoiler…..And is anyone else scared that not even one minor character died… That’s kinda sus….END MAJOR SPOILERS SECTIONAll in all, I would give this 4.8 stars because it was just so good, save for the extremely high expectations which were kinda curbed with her sudden plot change.The Azriel bonus scene was also super interesting and I’m excited to see what book 5 has in store for us!So I'm gonna go and digest this for a few days before rereading it all over againbecause I am a slut for Nessian.———PRE ACOSF RELEASE PREDICTIONS BELOWBecause Feb 2021 is coming nearer, I'm going to post my expectations for ACOSF because I'm a simp for Nessian.These will be a mix of stories from ACOTAR 1-3 I want told from their POVs as well as their own character arcs!FOR CASSIAN> More about his upbringing and his mother> Him wrecking oneBUILDINGin the Summer Court that resulted in him being banned lol> His first encounter with Bryaxis> Cassian taking Mor’s v*rginity> What the hell was in that box he threw into the Sidra 😭😭😭😭> Training the female Illyrians and Nesta> Seeing him more as a General Commander and not the class clown/comic relief in the IC that we saw him from Feyre’s POV. I need to see Warrior!CassianFOR NESTA> Learning more about her bond with her mother> Exploring her powers and what she is> Her initial days in Velaris after being Made> Acknowledging her destructive habits and learning to heal> I want to see Amren vs Nesta OR Mor vs Nesta and have Nesta KICK THEIR ASSES> Nesta and Emerie bonding>NESTA IN ILLYRIAN LEATHERS AND WALLOPING CASSIAN IN THE RING> Nesta taking the Rite!!!!> Kicking some Illyrian butts who try to make her feel inferior> Finding her own Inner Circle because I’ll be damned if she works for Rhys> Speaking of Rhys, I wanna see Nesta make him cry (I love Rhys but we all know he and Nesta hate each other lol)> Have her let go of Elain and finally be her own person with her own life that isn’t all about protecting her younger sisterThese are just off the top of my head but obvs there are more angsty Nessian scenes that Ineeeeeedto happen or else I will die",5

How strongly and personally it touched me.This is not an easy book to read and understand.I guess that part of its rawness and bittersweet tones are to blame on the fact that it's told from Nesta's pov, a character who was firstly written to be hated and who probably hates herself more than the audience ever could and eventually did.She's a very intense fictional person, and I'd lie if I said she didn't frustrate me to no end in more than one occasion.But I guess that's exactly what SJM wanted from this character.I could literally feel the self-hatred exude from the pages. The self-sabotaging, the way Nesta, who's never been a saint but who maybe was programmed to feel like she was one, denies herself everything that makes her feel even remotely worthy of light.I know how that feels, and I wanted to see what she would do to use her pain, her trauma and her past to mold herself into a new, damaged yet not spoilt, perpetually-evolving creature.I wasn't disappointed.I actually got more than I expected, because I eventually ended up falling in love with all the nuances this character possesses.Not one of them had offered to help save the Archeron family from poverty.They had thrown them all, mere children and a crumbling man, to the wolves.So Nesta had become a wolf. Armed herself with invisible teeth and claws, and learned to strike faster, deeper, more lethally. Had relished it. But when the time came to put away the wolf, she’d found it had devoured her, too.I must admit I never really was a fan of Nesta, but I didn't really ever hate her, either. I was simply indifferent to her and her antics, especially considering I knew being ACOTAR a Beauty and the Beast retelling, at least one of the sisters must be an asshole, and that's Nesta for you.I started getting interested in her as a character at the start of ACOWAR and, confession time, I mainly did it because of a pretty awesome Nessian fanart I've seen on instagram.Oh, don't judge me.The point is, as weak as I am for a good and steamy romance, it takes more than fantart and a few stolen glances to make me appreciate a difficult character, and if SJM managed to steal my heart with her Nesta, in the end, it means she did a great job that goes way beyond ships and smut.For the majority of the previous novels, Nesta is an unlikeable character, and for obvious reasons, the author doesn't want you to like her, so that it feels even more genuine when you start seeing there's good in her, and that she's perfectly nuanced, just like a real person.“There can be nothing more than sex, Cassian.”His jaw tightened, and he seemed to struggle with some internal battle before he said darkly, “Then I’ll take whatever you offer me.” He leaned in, his body still not touching hers, and said against her ear, “And I’ll take you however you wish me to.”Her toes curled on the stones, her hair dripping. “And if I wish to take you?”He smiled against her ear. “Then I’ll beg you to ride me into oblivion.”I want to discuss her character's journey in this review, because the book itself was good and the plot -the amount that was there, at least- was okay, but A Court of Silver Flames is a charcater-driven novel where the protagonist wasn't always a good person.For example, I've read at least a dozen reviews complaining about how this book makes you love Nesta and hate the rest of the original characters, or the opposite, and I can't say I don't see wher they come from, but I was lucky enough to fall in neither of these two categories since I've ended up loving Nesta and loving the other characters, as well, at the same time.They didn't always treat her with kindness, but I feel like they treated her in a very realistic way.When someone keeps pushing their luck, it's only a matter of time before people lose their patience.I loved how they each had a chance to connect and tangle their story with Nesta's, getting to know her, getting loved and understood by her, all of them finally getting a second chance at redemption and healing.One of the scenes I loved the most, is in fact, towards the end when Rhys kneels in front of Nesta after she's saved both Feyre and her baby's life. I lost it completely when they hugged.Nesta isn't an easy person to get along with. She's got a past that pretty much justifies her actions, but the way she choses to handle the consequences is all her own. And that's the point I feel like we need to remember. All her flaws are on display right from the start and there are moments when it even gets worse, but it's all part of her journey.It's only when you reach rock bottom that you can do anything but go up, right?“You could have ruled the world with your power,” he said carefully.“I don’t want to rule the world.” Her eyes were unguarded in a way he had never seen. Mate, she had called him.“What do you want?” Cassian managed to ask, voice rasping.She smiled, and damn if it wasn’t the loveliest thing he’d ever seen. “You.”“You’ve had me from the moment you met me.”She tucked a strand of hair behind an arched ear. “I know.”I loved how Nesta's relationship with Elain and Feyre was addressed. Elain could never do anything wrong in Nesta's eyes and the moment she (presumably) turned her back on her, Nesta was forcefully faced with a truth she wasn't ready to see, or better, that she didn't want to see.Same thing with Feyre. I felt like the sybolism of Feyre hanging paintings of everyone but Nesta in the new, opulent house she and her husband created, was for Nesta worse than any offense the inner circle ever thrown her way (and not without merit).One of the things Nesta resented most about about Feyre, in fact, is the fact that Nesta needed her to survive but Feyre didn't need her in return. Feyre was nothing but kind to her, all the time, but she hit her in the most subtle of ways, in a way that is more important to Feyre than words.Mind it, I don't mean what Nesta did and how she acted in the past is condonable, I'm just saying there's a reason behind her actions, reasons that will definitely help you (I don't say like, because you're allowed to still not like a character even if their past is justified) understand her a bit more.Nesta, as I see her, didn't like the hate and anger she felt all the time, especially towards her little sister. She, in fact, hated it and hated herself for feeling it.I've seen reviewers claim Nesta's friendship with Gwyn and Emerie made no sense, since she already had two sisters she could connect and make up with; I see their point, but I feel like Nesta was re-discovering herself and creating bonds tentatively presenting herself as the new person she was trying to become.Her relationship with the House, for example, was my absolute favorite. In my opinion, the fact that the House was stubborn, sweet, sarcastic in its own special way, warm and curious, added to the knowledge that Nesta Made it, makes me wonder (and hope) if that's exactly how Nesta sees her true self, if that's what she'd like others to see her.Rhys lifted his head. “This is a bad idea.”Cassian winked. “That should be written on the Night Court crest.”I loved seeing her through the eyes of someone who didn't fully know the darkest sides of her trauma and grief; I feel like it gave Nesta a glimps of what her life with her sisters could have been had her mother not gaslighted her into needing to be perfect at all costs, filling her head with conjectures and prejudices and depriving her from being free to decide what to do with her personality and future.And that's where Cassian finally jumps in. God bless that guy, honestly.I absolutely LOVED how he wasn't afraid to call her out on her bullshit but still knew (my god, he justknew) she needed some love despite it all, simple as that, and without asking anything in return.And sure, both Feyre and Elain loved Nesta, but I feel like the relationship the three sisters always had was always taunted by what they had to endure for and with one another.Feyre and Rhys will always own my heart, but Cassian and Nesta gave me the best emotions and I will never forget how beautiful they are together.And, holy shitNesta at the end, deciding she one day will want to have a baby with her Cassian completely destroyed me in the sweetest of ways. I don't consider motherhood as something essential, something you need to experience because it's mandatory to feel like a real woman. If a person feels complete and accomplished without ever having kids, I totally support it, but as a mother who has a problematic mother, I think it's one more proof of the fact that Nesta's journey is heading to a genuinely happy path.“I’ll be with you every step of the way,” he whispered into her palm. “Just don’t lock me out. You want to walk in silence for a week, I’m fine with that. So long as you talk to me at the end of it.”Plotwise speaking, there wasn't much going on, but I enjoyed it, nonetheless.One of the chapters I liked the most is when Nesta, Cassian and Azriel (instert Brooklyn99 BoyleMy fantasy threesome!gif) went to the Bog of Oorid looking for the Mask.I was fucking terrified by the whole Kelpie encounter.And the gift sharing moment was e v e r y t h i n g.I love Az with all my heart sigh.Also, I adored basically every scene with Gwyn and Emerie, especially when they were together.Maas's writing is exquisite as usual. I'll never stop being amazed by how vividly I can picture in my mind the scenes she describes.The only plotline I wish was handled a little better was the Rhys/Feyre andyou know whatone. Every choice Rhys made fromthatpoint, felt a bit uncharacteristical and not well thought enough.I decided to blame it on the emotion, because I refuse to think our Rhys would be anything but pragmatic when it comes to his Feyre's safety.Sorry if all of this makes little sense. This book and this character in particular made me really emotional in a way I'd never thought I'd feel toward a fantasy book carachter.Oh, and to lighten up the mood after this sob fest...this book also taught me something I've suspected for a while now, and that is, that everyone in acotar wants a piece of Azriel. Who am I to disagree.Nesta could hardly remember words. But she found them when she whispered into the darkness, “Stay with me.”A shudder rocked through him, but he only smiled as he tucked her into his side.And warm and safe and home at last in Cassian’s arms, Nesta slept.Ooooh, and in case you're wondering what my Nesta and Cassian look like...HERE.Drool with me.And thank me later.(they were made byartworks_by_rokiiwith AI and Photoshop, and they're PURE PERFECTION.)",5
572,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","✅Reread -Sept 2023This was a whole new reading experience. I got so much to say, so jumping right in.Why I rated it 1 star when I read it the first time-1. I read the whole series in one go instead of pacing myself or giving a break in between the ACOTAR world. Reading it immediately after ACOWAR and ACOFAS backfired. It led me to bebored.2. I thought it wastoo smutty.Which it still is fyi but this did not concern me in my reread oddly.3. I hadnot liked Nesta.Jumping straight from Feyre's journey was not an ideal decision. Feyre had a trilogy, so spending a lot of time with her compared to just one book of Nesta's did make an impact. I was still angry with Nesta and her treatment of Feyre.4. I simplyforgot about the majority of eventsthat were correlated to the Crescent City series when I made my GR account and rated it.Why I give it 5 stars now-1. Ipaced myself.Gave myself some time in between ACOWAR, AOCFAS and ACOSF. This worked brilliantly for me. There was proper balance.2. Idid not expect muchas I was concerned about how this reread will go. With my expectations low, the reread ended surprising me.3.I ADORED Nestathis time around. I found her journey admirable, relatable and far more understandable. Her struggles were portrayed in such a raw manner and the way she overcame them bit by bit was chef's kiss. I too, like the other characters had not given her a fair chance but when I did the way she blossomed into a wonderful character was worth rereading!! Nesta is such a badass and although I am not saying she was not wrong before (she was) but I understand now.I see Nesta Archeron, her being, and she is worthy.4.Romance and banterwas so fun. Cassian is such a softie and marshmallow at heart. I swear I just wanna give him a big bear hug.5. I loved reading about thepossibilities of different worlds connecting.There's so much that can happen.6. Theendingwas so emotional. I swear I was sobbing.Some things that might be controversial but I wanna state my take on it-1. I see people call Rhysand an arrogant asshole a lot in reference to his persona in this book.I disagree.Sure, he was harsh a bit but never arrogant, never an asshole. Rhys was always honest, never lying to anyone or Nesta. He has his mate to look after, his court to look after. People think that just cause he is Feyre's mate that's all there is to him. Wrong! Rhys is also High Lord. Trained to be a leader and warrior, he talks and acts like one. He doesn't have to act soft towards others he doesn't know well. And Nesta was that one person, he did not know.Just cause someone criticizes you, does not mean they are your enemy.The amount of hate Rhys gets is just uncalled for imo.2. This might not be so controversial butNesta's powers???The thing that happened at the end should not have happened. That's all I'll say to keep it spoiler free lol.Without elaborating much on my private life, I just wanna say- I felt Nesta's journey deeply and it resonated with me. There have been some changes in my own life since the last time I read this book and all I say to Nesta is, I get it.Man, I just had a completely new experience reading this lmao. Am sitting here as I draft my review, thinking wtf did I read the first time😂🙈~•~•~It's time to give Nesta another chance. The first time I read it, I thought it was kinda boring and too smutty (I know I know😭🫣) but hopefully this reread will be better.",5

574,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","”Your power is a song, and one I’ve waited a very, very long time to hear, Nesta”.Aviso: la primera parte de esta reseña va a estar libre despoilersy les diré cuando empiecen a aparecer para que puedan dejar de leerla si no quieren saber qué pasa.No sé por qué me sigo sorprendiendo de que Sarah J. Maas lo logre una y otra vez. Es absolutamente impresionante lo que esta mujer puede llegar a transmitir con sus palabras. De verdad, leyendo ACOSF sentí que me destrozaban hasta lo más hondo y que luego, poco a poco, me iban reconstruyendo y poniendo cada pieza en su lugar.Como muchos aquí, debo confesar que no estaba tan emocionada por este libro porque se centraría en Nesta. Pero, así mismo, tengo que admitir que me comí todas y cada una de mis reservas y que, leyendo cada página, entendí profundamente a Nesta, sus traumas, su sufrimiento, su personalidad, la culpa que siente todo el tiempo y la sensación de que nunca eres lo suficientemente bueno para nadie. Y no sólo la entendí, sino que me sentí jodidamente identificada. Y, claro, luego me di cuenta de que odiaba tantísimo a Nesta porque reflejaba las partes más horribles de mí misma.ACOSF es un libro tremendamente intenso y lleno de emociones, de momentos de confrontar los sentimientos más oscuros, de arrepentimientos, rabia y odio. Pero también es una historia que lleva a Nesta en un camino que le permite enfrentar todos los demonios que tiene por dentro, todas las cosas que se ha guardado durante años, las decisiones que le quitaron de las manos y su odio hacia sí misma. Y, a pesar de lo oscuro que es el pozo en el que está y de lo duro que es el camino, Nesta se va a dar cuenta de que siempre va a existir alguien al otro lado de esa oscuridad para tenderle una mano, para caminar junto a ella y para recordarle una y otra vez que sí que se merece el amor de sus amigos y de su familia. Que nunca va a estar sola.En serio, no les puedo decir con palabras lo hondo que me llegó esta historia al corazón. Sí, es el libro máshotde Sarah J. Maas y todas esas escenas están diseñadas para ser leídas mientras estás en una tina llena de hielo porque… joder. Y obviamente las marqué todas y casi me da un infarto leyendo otras. Y también mucha envidia. Pero más allá de eso, creo que eran una forma súper poderosa de comunicar lo mucho que Nesta necesitaba una distracción, salirse de sus pensamientos durante unos momentos… u horas (because Fae lovers, jajaja) porque estar dentro de su cabeza era demasiado doloroso. Y la entiendo.Y Cassian… ay, ¿cómo puede existir alguien tan bueno, valiente, sensible y paciente? Si amaron a Cassian en los libros anteriores, en este van a querer abrazarlo (y más cosas, ejem) hasta que todo esté bien para él. No se pueden imaginar todo lo que conocemos sobre Cassian en ACOSF, sobre su pasado, sus sentimientos, sus miedos y, sobre todo, cómo es tan genuino como para siempre demostrar lo mucho que le importan quienes son cercanos para él, todo lo que estaría dispuesto a hacer y soportar por ellos. En este libro, Cassian enfrenta toda la tormenta de proporciones épicas que significa estar cerca de Nesta, pero lo hace porque sabe que ella está en un lugar oscuro, que está luchando por salir de allí y él la entiende… porque ha estado él mismo en ese camino antes. Joder, es que, de verdad… después de leer este tipo de cosas, ves a las personas del mundo real y te das cuenta de que eso no existe. Ojalá todos pudiéramos tener la certeza de que, cuando salgamos de nuestros momentos más oscuros, siempre va a estar alguien allí esperándonos para decirnos que todo va a estar bien o incluso sólo para sonreírnos o abrazarnos.Ahora, obviamente todo el libro no se centra únicamente en Nesta y Cassian, sino que Sarah J. Maas nos presenta una nueva amenaza que puede, nuevamente, destruir todas las Cortes e incluso afectar al mundo de los humanos. Pero esta es una amenaza mucho más antigua, poderosa y letal de lo que el Rey de Hybern pudo llegar a ser. Más adelante hablaré de ello, pero me gustó que hubiera una historia paralela de conflicto, de magia arcana y de monstruos que no pueden volver a caminar libremente por el mundo.Antes de empezar con la sección despoilers, tengo que decirles que amé profundamente volver a ver a los personajes que adoro. Feyre, Rhysand, Mor, Amren y Azriel no son solamente sombras en el fondo de las escenas de ACOSF, sino que siguen siendo importantes y están allí para los momentos más críticos. Ahora, que ellos sean ligeramente menos importantes en este libro que Cassian y Nesta no quiere decir que Sarah J. Maas no los vaya a usar para rompernos el corazón, triturar los pedacitos, sumergirlos en ácido y luego incinerarlos. De verdad, es tremendo… Y lo único que diré, y que discutiré más a fondo más adelante, es que les juro que no pude parar de llorar con el último 10% del libro. Y no precisamente de felicidad.Vamos con losspoilersy con Isa perdiendo la cabeza… de nuevo.•••1. Sí, vamos a hablar de la dedicatoria del libro. Cuando la leí al principio dije como “oh, vaya, bueno”, pero ahora que la estoy releyendo y estoy escribiendo esta reseña, puedo decirles que casi lloro. Dice”For every Nesta out there, climb the mountain”.2. Las pesadillas que tiene Nesta nos dan una pista de todo lo que está batallando por dentro desde que la sumergieron en elCauldrony, joder, poco a poco entendemos por qué es como es. Nadie que lidie con pesadillas que describe como el frío antes de las estrellas, el vacío antes del infierno, puede siquiera fingir estar bien.3. ¿Cómo me atreví a juzgar a Nesta sin saber que ella sentía la inmortalidad como un fuego eterno y no como una serena juventud? Son estas pequeñas frases las que nos dan, incluso en las primeras páginas, las pistas que necesitamos para ver lo destrozada que está, que toda su mala actitud es una coraza para protegerse.4. Me rompe el corazón ver a Cassian al principio del libro admitiendo que el fuego helado de los ojos de Nesta siempre había sido una tentación para él. Y es que justo lo piensa cuando está en su apartamento destartalado en donde ella se ha estadofuckinga cuantos machos Fae quisiera y bebiendo hasta perder el conocimiento… Y lo peor es que Nesta tiene a un macho en su cuarto en ese momento. Agh.5. Y luego ella admite para sí misma que todo ese sexo con desconocidos, el alcohol y la música la ayuda a apagar un poco ese fuego frío y oscuro que la consume desde que la forzaron a entrar alCauldron. Nesta siempre ha estado muy rota y siento que la hemos juzgado demasiado sin saber exactamente lo mal que lo estaba pasando dentro de su cabeza.6. Lo triste es que hay una cita que dice que ese sexo no la hacía sentir nada más allá de un momento fugaz de liberación de ese poder cataclísmico que hay dentro de ella. Pero luego se ríe un poco y dice que incluso los siglos de experiencia que algunos machos Fae tienen no los hacen buenos en la cama, jajaja.7. EL HORROR del momento en el que Cassian vuelve a ese apartamento y le dice que se nota que ni siquiera se ha dignado a cambiar las sábanas entre sus visitantes PORQUE PUEDE OLERLOS. Dioses, en serio Nesta está en un punto muy bajo en ese momento.8. Es tremendo cuando Feyre y los demás le dan un ultimátum a Nesta: o accede a entrenar con Cassian por las mañanas y a ayudar a las acólitas de la biblioteca por las tardes e intenta enderezar su vida o la van a enviar de vuelta al mundo humano. Esa pelea y esa conversación son durísimas, pero tenían que darle un empujón para que empezara a salir de ese pozo.9. AMO A RHYSAND. Hay un momento en el que está hablando con Cassian después de la “intervention” de Nesta. Y Cass le dice que tiene que volver a entrenar porque no querría que Feyre, sumate, encontrara partes blandas en su cuerpo. Y RHYS RESPONDE QUE ELLA NUNCA ENCUENTRA NADA BLANDO Y OMG, JAJAJA. Y luego hablan de que Rhys les dio el día libre a los sirvientes y Cassian cree que es para que no los escuchen pelear después de lo de Nesta, pero Rhys le dice que no son las peleas lo que no quiere que escuchen, AIUDA.10. Se me rompió MAL el corazón cuando Cassian vio el retrato de Feyre y Rhys juntos, sus anillos y a ellos mismos y lo invadió ese sentimiento de querer lo que ellos tienen, a alguien especial a su lado. POBRECILLO MÍO.11. Ay, dioses, y más adelante Cassian dice que tiene que alejarse mucho de la casa del río porque no quiere ni oírlo ni sentir su poder cuando Rhys… acabe. PERO ES QUE ESO NO ES TODO. Luego menciona como quien no quiere la cosa que, cuando eran más jóvenes, Az, Rhys y Cassian se f*llaban a muchísimas hembras Y GENERALMENTE EN LA MISMA HABITACIÓN. ¿ES QUE NADIE VA A HABLAR DE ESTO? O sea… dioses. A mí nadie me puede quitar de la cabeza que esos tres…you know. QUIERO UNFANFICDE ESTO YA MISMO.12. AMO cada vez que Cassian molesta a Nesta recordándole lo mucho que le gusta leer novelas eróticas, jajaja.13. Uf, también me rompe el corazón los momentos en los que Nesta admite para sí misma que sabe lo desagradable que es con los demás, lo dura que es la coraza que la rodea y lo asustada que está ella misma de ese pozo infinito de poder oscuro que tiene dentro de ella. Y hay una cita en la que dice que siempre se sintió cómoda siendo como un lobo, como un depredador, pero que cuando llegó el momento de eliminar a ese ser feroz, se dio cuenta de que la había devorado incluso a ella.14. Ehhh… ¿podemos hablar de que Rhys sigue siendo un loquillo? Es que le habla por el vínculo mental a Cassian en medio de dos… eh…roundscon Feyre,if you know what I mean.15. A ver, todos sabemos que, tarde o temprano, Cassian y Nesta van a hacerlo sobre todas las superficies de la Casa, pero es que toda la tensión previa es la que me matabaaaaaa. ¡La tensión y las frases con doble sentido y los gruñidos bajos! En el primer día de entrenamiento, Cassian le dice a Nesta, con voz súper grave, que le alegra que se haya levantado lista para jugar. Y ELLA SE DERRITE AUNQUE NUNCA LO ACEPTARÁ EN VOZ ALTA… todavía.16. PERO LO QUE SÍ RECUERDA ES ESE MOMENTO EN LA BATALLA FINAL, ahhhh. O sea, cuando pensaron que iban a morir y él la besó y le dijo que desearía haber tenido más tiempo, pero que la encontrará en esta vida y las siguientes. Es que me muero. Y Nesta admite mentalmente que nunca deja de pensar en ese momento. Ayyyyyy, ya bésenseeeee.17. Sarah J. Maas me quiere matar porque luego Nesta dice que si Cassian cree que todo esto de entrenar va a terminar con ella subiéndose a su cama, que está muy equivocado. Y él dice que eso está clarísimo, que él no se va a subir a la cama de ella, PORQUE ES ELLA QUIEN VA A SUPLICAR ESTAR EN LA CAMA DE CASSIAN. AYUDA, NECESITO AGUA FRÍA.18. Y no soy la única que necesita hielo porque cuando Cassian ve a Nesta en losIllyrian leathersde entrenar, que son pantalones y equipo muy ajustado, el pobre casi muere y empieza a fantasear sobre todo lo que haría quitándole esos pantalones y… uf.19. Y justo después de esas fantasías Cassian recuerda que no ha tenido más compañía que su mano desde hace más de dos años, cuando lo hizo duro y rápido contra una pared de ladrillo con una hembra cualquiera que encontró en un bar. O SEA, CASSIAN ESTÁHORNYY LA QUE NOS ESPERA EN ESTE LIBRO… MADRE DE TODOS LOS DIOSES.20. Esos primeros días de entrenamiento cuando Cassian lleva a Nesta a Windhaven y ella se niega a levantarse de una roca y entrenar son tremendos. Y es obvio que todos losillyrianse están burlando de Cassian por dejar que una mujer tan terca le gane… y aunque Nesta sabe que lo está haciendo ver débil y lo odia, no puede ceder porque siente que es mejor que la odie a que se acerque. MI CORAZÓN.21. Parte de la razón por la que este libro me enseñó a no odiar a Nesta es que entendemos mucho más cómo piensa. Y me identifiqué un montón, de verdad. Verla a ella era verme a mí en los momentos más horrorosos de salud mental. Cuando ella dice que odia todo lo que es, que está absolutamente exhausta y que está cansada de querer estar en un lugar que no sea su cabeza… wow.I felt that.22. Me encantó la conversación que tienen Amren y Cassian en la que ella le dice que deje que Nesta cave su propia tumba, pero que al final le ofrezca su mano. Que no se rinda y siga ofreciéndole su ayuda para salir de ese lugar oscuro.23. FAAAAAAAN de que Lucien diga que Tamlin está sufriendo y que desde el final de la guerra no ha adoptado su forma Fae, sino que está vagando por su corte como la bestia que es.Fucker.24. Sabes que se vienen problemas cuando empiezas a enterarte de que las criaturas poderosísimas que inclinaron la balanza en favor de la Corte de la Noche tienen hermanos. En este caso, nos presentan a Koschei, el hermano delBone Carver. Y que parece que está aliado con Briallyn, una de las reinas que entró alCauldrony que ahora quiere recuperar laDread Trove, una colección de objetos poderosísimos, hechos por elCauldronmismo, que tiene el poder de empezar otra guerra y borrarlos a todos del mapa.Oh, joy.25. Hay una mañana en la que Nesta casi no puede moverse porque la noche anterior intentó bajar las 10.000 escaleras que separan a la Casa de Velaris. Y Cassian se da cuenta en el desayuno y la molesta con que no se puede ni parar. Y ella lo hace apoyándose un montón en sus manos, pero él le dice que no cuenta si son las manos las que están haciendo todo el trabajo. Y ELLA LE DICE QUE SON SUS MANOS LAS QUE DEBEN ESTAR OCUPADAS TODAS LAS NOCHES, OMG. Entonces Cassian le responde con voz grave que si es eso lo que le enseñan sus libros eróticos, que sólo se hace por la noche. Él nota Y HUELE lohotque se pone ella y sigue diciendo que se puede hacer en cualquier momento, con la luz del día, durante un baño o incluso después de una LARGA Y DURA sesión de entrenamiento. En serio, lean este libro con hielo a la mano.26. ¡Lo peor es que toda esa conversación sucede mientras Az también está en la mesa con ellos! Y al final, cuando Nesta se va, Azriel le dice a Cassian que lo va a tener muy jodido, pero él ya no lo está ni escuchando porque en su cabeza se está imaginando todo lo que las manos de Nesta podrían hacer con él y JODER, LES DIJE QUE ESTE LIBRO ES DEMASIADO CALIENTE. Y ESO QUE NO HA SUCEDIDO NADA.27. Uf, golpe bajo cuando, en medio de una pelea porque Nesta sigue negándose a entrenar en Windhaven, Cassian también explota y ella le responde diciéndole que genial, que menos mal ya no lo va a tener babeando detrás de ella y que le costó mucho entender las señales de que ella no lo quería. Y MALDITA SEA, OBVIAMENTE LO QUIERES. Y ÉL A TI. Pero también entiendo la reacción de querer alejar a todo el mundo cuando ni tú te soportas a ti misma.***SIGUE EN COMENTARIOS***",5

This has to be the most times I've ever cried in a book I swear to godI'm still crying right now.From the beginning of the book to the end...eventhe acknowledgments, all of it destroyed me. My heart—This has been said many times, but I love you so much Sarah. Sarah, my queen. Sarah, my goddess. My love for SJM will never cease to exist.═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══🛑Note: The first part will have NO SPOILERS, while the 2nd will definitely have SPOILERS. I'll have a warning when it comes to that.═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""Everyone deserves happiness. The road there isn't easy. It is long, and hard, and often travelled utterly blind. But you keep going.Because you know the destination will be worthwhile.""This isNesta's special journey. Nesta's journey through dealing with her trauma. Struggling with the pain she's been in and healing.Finding the ability to love herself.I didn't think SJM could write a better book for mental health than ACOMAF, but I believe right here, she didexactlythat. There wasn't a single scene where I didn't feel likemy heart was breaking.This was such an emotional ride. I could actually relate to Nesta and while it isn't as severe as her, there are times where I'd also hate myself and feel like I deserve nothing. And seeing Nesta deal with all of this --it broke me in so many ways. To have her in so much pain and think that she herself has to change in order to be ""fixed""... ohmygod no I swear I cant.😭🤚Then there was Cassian. I love how he wouldn't give up on Nesta and even while trying to help her, he still didn't let her get away with everything.He kept reaching out his handthroughout it all. But in the end, the only person who could heal Nesta wasNesta herself.You can help someone as much as you want, but at the end of all that, it's up to them tosee past that darkness and find the light. Tolove themselvesandbe happywith who they are.To heal the parts of you that hurt so much and hurt others.im crying again dammitThis book hit me so hard. I'm actually such a mess. I never thought I could love a book this much. Not surprised it was Queen SJM that did this to me.I willneverforget the impact Nesta's story had on me. There's no doubt that I'll be rereading this so many times in the future. Already I feel like rereading. My god, what has she done to me *sobs* is this what love feels like?═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══🛑SPOILER part of the review below. Do not go past this if you haven't read ACOSF.🛑═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══She would not be mastered by anything again. She was the master of herself.I know I talked about Nesta already but seriously she's such a queen. Cassian wasn't the only one there for her. We're introduced to new characters in this book andI love it. Honestly, it had to be my favourite part of her story.Nesta's friendship with Emerie and Gwyn was so, so,so wholesome and sweet.Each of them had their own past that haunted them and were afraid for the other to find out.But that's exactly what made them fit so well together.That moment where they all shared their secrets with each other, realizing that the other wouldn't be judging them...I cried so muchnot surprisingomg it was so beautiful to see them open up.Their love for each other was tested especially when they had to participate in The Blood Rite. I was so shook, I actually didn't think they'd be doing it, but ohmygodthat was so stressful. I was terrified SJM would destroy me again and kill Emerie or Gwyn.Thank god she took pity on our poor hearts.Also, omg them training to be Valkyries dsfdsfgd YES YESYES. I LOVED that so much. And to see them in action during The Blood Rite against those bastards???Perfection.but also really stressful bc my gurls🥺ALSO THE FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS OHMYGOD I CANNOT.HEARTBREAKING AND BEAUTIFUL.I legit hope Gwyn and Emerie play bigger roles in the next two books, especially *ahem* because I have some ships in mind.😏 Yes, I may be too early but I believe in EmeriexMor and AzrielxGwyn🙏═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""The first time I saw that look on your face, you were still human. Still human, and I nearly went to my knees before you.""Tell me, what's one of the most heartbreaking scenes you've ever read?I'll tell you mine --CHAPTER 50. That was so heart-wrenching, my heart died. My own sisters were looking at me like I was insane. But something even more heartbreaking?CASSIANCRYINGThat completely and utterly destroyed me. I was dying on the inside. Just thinking about him crying, is making me cry. I swear to god, I literally putmy heart through torture reading this.Seeing through Cassian's POV is the greatest gift we could've asked for. All the flaws and insecurities he feels, I'm in so muchp a i n. I adore himeven morethan before. He was there for Nesta and Nesta was there for him, my heart-""Forgiveness is not that easy.""""Forgiveness is something we also grant ourselves. And I can talk to you until these mountains crumble around us, but if you don't wish to be forgiven, if you don't want to stop feeling this way...it won't happen.""Hello? Please stop destroying me.Please, Cas.""You don't need to become some impossible ideal. You don't need to become sweet and simpering. You can give everyone thatI Will Slay My Enemieslook—which is my favourite look, by the way. You can keep that sharpness I like so much, that boldness and fearlessness. I don't want you to ever lose things, to cage yourself.""STOP. THE. PAIN. *cries* Cas, when did you become so wise and give such heart crushing speeches?? This is one of the most beautiful lines I've ever read. No question about it.Also, to finally find out what was in the solstice gift Cassian wanted to give Nesta -- it wasA BOOK.Okay imma stop right there, I'm crying again. I cant do this.🥺😭(And Azzy & Nesta's friendship...*sobs* beautiful. HE GAVE HER AFAELIGHT FOR READING AS A SOLSTICE GIFT. PLEASE, MY HEART-)═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""That's the key, isn't it? To know the darkness will always remain, but how you choose to face it, handle it...that's the important part. To not let it consume. To focus upon the good, the things that fill you with wonder.""""The struggle with that darkness is worth it, just to see such things.""Am I really dedicating a whole section toThe House of Wind?Yes, yes I am.I absolutelyloveNesta, but my god The House of Wind is the BEST part of this book. Absolutely amazing and kind. I didn't I could lovea houseso much, but here I am.Nesta wished for a friend and the House became that friend for her. It encouraged her to do more, pushed her to try more. The Housereads romance novels. I'm crying, I love the House so much. And the darkness that swirled at the bottom of the library?? I can't believe that was theheartof the House ohmygod please I love it. The way Nesta accepted the way it was, just like the House did that for her...sdfgdsfs I'm in pain. *sobs* too much for my heart.AND IT GAVE NESTA CHOCOLATE CAKE AND ROMANCE BOOKS.What's not to love about the House???woah wait, why is this reminding me of celaena with her love of chocolate cake and books *shook*The House of Wind ise v e r y t h i n g.═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""I went into the Cauldron, too, you know. And it capturedme.And yet somehow all you think of is whatmytrauma did toyou.""(This is Nesta's book, but I justhaveto say this.)I'm guilty of this too, but I think most of us hated Elain because of how we saw her, being sweet, kind and useless...and judged her right away,forgetting that she also is stillsufferinggoing into the Cauldron and with what happened in the war against Hybern.Just like Nesta, Elain has a different way of showing her trauma and that's byhiding it awayand making it look like she's okay, using the image everyone thinks of her being--sweet and kind. It's just like we all think of her and hate her for that. Everyone expects Elain to be one thing, so she acts like that BUTis that truly Elain?So yeah, I judged her too early. (Feysand's POV really helped with this too) I shouldn't hate her right away because there's still her story to be told. I'm actually excited to see that.But even knowing all of this, I still don't like Elain.🤷‍♀️ I understand it and everything but just something about her rubs me off the wrong way. I don't hate her, but I don't like her either. I have no doubt Sarah will make us love, or at the very least, like Elain next book.Also, I seriously do not ship her with Azriel.I believeAzriel and Gwynwould be such a beautiful pair ohmygod I'd love that so much. If the three brothers get with the three archeron sisters...no no no,pleaseno. And I absolutely love the Azriel POV. My heart is hurting so much for Azzy🥺 He needs the love he deserves.Omg every time he'd appear as the""chaperone""for Nesta and Cassian--omg I was dying of laughter. I loved those scenes. Poor Azzy having to deal with Nesta and Cas, tsk tsk naughty Fae. But the friendship between Nesta and Azzy ohmygod my heart, im crying it was so beautiful. Azzy have NestaAlso, something else as to why I think AzrielxElain wont be endgame is because during the solstice dance, both Cas and Eris talk about how smothered/plain Elain is wearing black, which I feel like is SJM's way of saying thatElain isn't compatible with The Night Court and it's darkness & shadows.ahhh I truly feel like she's going to go to another court in the next book.Also Azzy's shadowsdisappearwhen they're around Elain. Meanwhile, the shadowsdontdisappear around Gwyn...they come alive around her. I don't know about you, but it looks like SJM is trying to say something👀I stan Gwynriel“I am the rock against which the surf crashes.""“Nothing can break me.”AND THE FACT THAT AZZY SINGS AND GWYN SINGS SDFGSDFD I CANT😭🤚═══*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*═══""I'll deny it to the grave if you tell anyone, but I missed you too, Cursebreaker.""Helion is amazing sdfgdsfsdf I love him so much. I think we can all agree withneedingmore Helion these next few books. And for Lucien to find out the truth🥺 We need a Lucien book so bad omg so many books needed.I'm so curious as to what really was going on when Nesta asked about Jurian & Vassa and Lucien replied sharply HMM I may be reading too much into that, but something's going on ughhh I wanna know more about those three.ALSO,ERIS. There is SO MUCH MORE to Eris then is shown. I really want to see more Eris and his story. I believe there's a lot more to him and Cas even sees that he's a decent guy.Oh, another thing I forgot to mention was the fact thatNesta Made three magic weaponsand one of them she named the swordAtaraxia, which meansInner Peace...I'm in love. I stan Nesta so much. She grew to be so much stronger than she was before annnnnd the tears are coming in again.😃✌This reminds me of Feyre and Nesta's relationship. *sobs* It brings me joy to see thetwo finally understand and show their love for each other. No matter what, Feyre wouldn't give up on her either. She tried so hard to help Nesta and I love Feyre so much for that. Unlike *cough* some people *cough* Rhysand. I actually despise him SO MUCH, it was so messed up. The way I hate this guy with every fibre of my being😃Although, I have to say that when Nesta apologized to everyone it irked me. Like yeah, she did say harmful things to them, but the Inner Circle did too?? Honestly, they should've apologized too, mainly Rhys and Amren but ah, that didn't happen *rage* they should grovel at her feet.OMG WAIT. JUST ONE MORE THING I REALIZED.THIS:THAT WASAELIN.

576,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","This book made a lot of choices. Most of them were bad.A Court of Silver Flamesfeels like poorly written ACOTAR fanfiction. It has all the tags and features: making you hate the canon main characters, an uncomfortable pregnancy, the incorporation of lore you didn’t ask for and don’t need, ridiculously toxic love interests, and an unnecessary 200,000 word count.Let’s talk about the High Lord of the Night Court, a character who was a villain, then an adored main character, and now a villain again. Rhysand is so violent and overprotective and his only personality trait is “I will shred you to bits if you touch or breathe on or think about Feyre.” He literally put a shield around her so even her friends couldn’t be around her. Rhysand is only respectful to women who are submissive to him and obey his authority. He was nice to Nesta only after she made a huge sacrifice at the end for his sake. He’s so bitter, and I don’t know why Feyre finds that attractive. I liked him before because he wasn’t overprotective. He let Feyre do what she wanted. But now…“Cassian knew [Rhysand would] shred anyone who so much as blinked wrong at Feyre into a million bloody ribbons.”lol.Feyre is just a decoration in this book. Although she does have power, we don’t see her use it like she did in the previous books. What happened to that important and empowering fight to make her High Lady? Now she has no agency.I’m especially angry because this is so out of character for the Inner Circle. Mor’s development horrified me in particular. She was abused badly in the Court of Nightmares, so she knows how terrible and sick they are. Azriel even describes the way she “savored every moment in the sun… as if the first seventeen years of her life, spent in the darkness of the Hewn City, still lurked around her.” But then Mor says this:Mor sipped her tea, the portrait of elegant innocence. “We’d be better off throwing Nesta into the Court of Nightmares. She’d thrive there.”What happened to the Inner Circle who accepted Feyre with open arms and helped her heal from her sorrow and trauma? Is Feyre’s grief more palatable to the Inner Circle than Nesta’s? The sisters process their hurt in different ways, but Rhysand acts like Nesta is an embarrassment to the family because of it, like they would be the perfect family if it weren’t for her. In contrast, Feyre gets all the support she needs. There are ways to build up new protagonists without turning the ones we already love into villains.I haven’t even talked about the worst part of the book yet: Feyre’s situation. (I think this was revealed pretty early in the book, so it isn’t a spoiler. But you can fast forward to the next paragraph if you don’t want to know.) Feyre is in the middle of a life-threatening pregnancy with a baby that could literally rip her apart. Guess who decides by committee that it would be better not to tell her this vital information about her pregnancy, her health, her life, and the baby inside her body. That’s right: Rhysand and the Inner Circle. A really important theme of ACOTAR is individual, personal freedom. But this threw that all away. I cannot describe how infuriated this made me. And when Nesta made the decision to tell Feyre that childbirth would kill her (a decision made out of spite, but still a good one for Feyre), the response from the other characters was bizarre. From what I remember, Feyre was upset but ultimately supported the Inner Circle’s decision to hide this from her, and Nesta was forcibly and emphatically rejected by her family. I can’t make this stuff up.Parts ofA Court of Silver Flameswere good, although they were few and far between. The Blood Rite was pretty cool. The tension and high stakes and character development and the way the Valkyries bonded in their struggle was amazing. I really liked Emerie and Gwyn, and I’m invested in their backgrounds and their journeys to come. They are refreshingly unproblematic and normal. They are easy characters to love.Besides the ending, the plot wasn’t very good. The search for the Crown/Harp/Mask felt arbitrary and too random for my taste. It also got sidetracked constantly, so it wasn’t satisfying to me. However, this gripe seems so minor compared to the rest of the dumpster fire that isA Court of Silver Flamesthat I don’t even care.“My mate” every other pageHas filled me with unending rageBreaking Dawn-esque pregnancyFeels like a fanfic fever dreamAzriel, he shadow-singsCas doesn’t have the longest wingsFeyre does interior designNesta walks a narrow lineGwyn and Emerie are true heroesCassian’s over five zero zeroSister’s sick? Don’t fret, just kissThrow me into the abyssDot dot dot, dash dash dashDown the stairs you crash crash crashBones will bark and eyes are darkRed flags are Rhys’s trademarkThe day I forget about this book will be a good day indeed.1.5 stars",2
577,"A ​Court of Silver Flames (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #4)","I’m onBookTube! =)Read my full and uncut version of this review:here!Or just continue with the short one. ;-)Rhys lifted his head. “This is a bad idea.”Cassian winked. “That should be written on the Night Court crest.”I’m honestly surprised it’s not written there already, because ever since I started to read about the Night Court they made great and horrible decisions. *lol* And yes, hi, it’s me finally writing my review for this book. It only took me a year to get to it, but to be honest the amount of quotes I tabbed in this story were kind of intimidating. Jello and I read this as a buddy read and since it took us an entire year to finish the book it’s okay that it also took me a year to write my review, right? ;-P I promise to improve. Or just not to tab the hell out of my books in future. Haha! Anyway! Let’s talk about “A Court of Silver Flames”!This book wasn’t just different when it came to the title (ACOSF instead of ACOTAR etc.) but also very different in its structure. The focus was clearly on Nesta’s journey and her character/redemption arc but also on the relationships between the characters. Well, and yes, there were a lot of sex scenes. I usually don’t mind them but I think it would have helped the book if Sarah would have focused less on Nesta’s and Cassian’s mind-blowing sexual encounters and more on the storyline instead. The plot really took such a backseat in this story and I don’t know how I feel about it. I mean I was okay with exploring Nesta’s trauma and her redemption arc and with the introduction of so many new characters. It was interesting to see all those various dynamics and how they shaped the people involved but I really missed a stronger focus on the plot and this got even more pronounced near the ending.The ending totally wasn’t my cup of tea. For one thing everything happened way too fast and the revelations were neither surprising nor explored? It’s kind of hard to pinpoint what didn’t work for me but it was just this huge agglomeration of all the plot threads and in the end it was all over and I still craved for more context. I have no idea if that explanation makes any sense but it’s the way I felt and I really hope Sarah J. Maas will get her focus back on the storyline in the next book. For me it felt like she sort of lost her way and once she realized she needed to resolve the plot line as well, she rushed it and everything came together way too conveniently. I think it speaks volumes that everything, literally everything the story worked towards to was solved in the last 50 pages or so. So yeah, the plot felt like an afterthought in ACOSF and I genuinely hope that Sarah will focus more on it in the next book. *fingers crossed*This said let’s go right for my characters section because I have THOUGHTS (as always. *lol*) and I need to get them off my chest.The characters:Welcome to Velaris, the home of the Night Court! We have a lot of amazing sights and places to explore, but we also have lots of spoilers! So if you don’t want to be spoiled you better turn in the other direction and leave our city asap! This is a fair warning and it’s your choice whether you enter or not. As the city’s guard my job here is done. ;-)Nesta:”And the dark eternity around her shuddered. Bucked. Trashed.She laughed as it recoiled. Laughed around the mouthful of raw power she ripped out and swallowed whole; laughed at the fistfuls of eternity she shoved into her heart, her veins.The Cauldron struggled like a bird under a cat’s paw. She refused to relent.”What to say about Nesta? She’s still not my favourite ACOTAR character and probably never will be, but I finally understand where she’s coming from and how she thinks and feels. Sarah did an amazing job with her redemption arc and I think if you still feel bitter towards Nesta after reading this book it might be out of sheer pettiness. It was good to be in her head because it helped to understand her better and even though I still don’t like a lot of the decisions she made I can’t help but respect her. She knows she hurt many people with her behaviour and she really tries to do better which is more than can be said for a lot of other people. Some never realize their failures or just refuse to recognize them, but Nesta? Nesta tackled them head-on and tried to become a better person. It’s never too late to make amends and to try to do better so I admire her for it. Plus her trauma was extremely severe and I genuinely doubt that a lot of people would have been able to deal with a trauma like that. The fact Nesta did and came out of it alive on the other side speaks of her strength and who knows maybe we’ll see more of this strong and stubborn woman in the next books. I really hope so because she’s definitely a person I’d love to be friends with. The way she charmed Eris so much with her dancing he probably would have died of cardiac arrest if the song wouldn’t have ended was amazing and by far one of my favourite dancing scenes in a book ever! It was marvellous! And the fact she and the sentient house bonded over smutty books was more than just relatable. *lol* I kinda love the idea that she might become the leader of the Valkyries in the next books and I’m so ready to see it. Nesta is no longer the victim and she can stand up for herself and her friends now. It was beautiful to see her character growth and even though she isn’t as powerful as she used to be after she saved Feyre and her son, she is still a force to be reckoned with. The mother is on her side too so this is pretty impressive and I’m sure we’ll see more of this in the books to come. =)”Though she had fought back against Tomas, against the Cauldron, against the King of Hybern, they had all happened to her. She had survived, but she had been helpless and afraid.Not today.Today, she would happen to him.””She had been born wrong. Had been born with claws and fangs and had never been able to keep from using them, never been able to quell the part of her that roared at betrayal, that cold hate and love more violently than anyone ever understood. Elain had been the only one who perhaps grasped it, but now her sister loathed her.She didn’t know how to fix it. How to make any of it right. How to stop being this way.”Cassian:”They were wrong.” his eyes glittered fiercely. “What they learned was that we love each other as true brothers. And there was nothing that we wouldn’t do, no one we wouldn’t kill, to reach each other. To save each other. We killed our way across the mountains, and made it through the Breaking – the worst of Ramiel’s three routes to the top – and we won the damn thing.”Ahh Cassian. It was so good to find out more about him and his past and it only made me love him even more. I already loved Cassian in the former books but this time around we got his POV and I was so happy to be able to dive into his mind. He’s really such a beautiful person inside and out and I totally get why Nesta thought that he would be too good for her. He’s such a generous and kind soul and he always tries to make the best decisions for everyone. Plus he’s good at putting himself in the position of someone else and I really loved that about him. While all the others didn’t get Nesta and Lucien and didn’t bother to understand them and their motives, Cassian fought for them and gave them the benefit of the doubt. It was really nice to see him care about Nesta and Lucien and that he acknowledged their pain. That’s more than can be said for all the others. I think if given the time Lucien and he might actually become friends. Also he’s humble and patient! Cassian is so powerful but he never abuses his power and always tries to use it for good instead. I just love this man, okay?! And I was so angry at Eris for making him feel inferior. But at the end when he notices the person Eris truly is he doesn’t make him feel worse, no he tells him that he sees him and hands him an olive branch instead and wow, if that isn’t altruistic and generous then I don’t know. (Yes, he also called him a coward in the same breath but honestly Eris deserved that one.) Cassian is awesome! Period.”Cassian was good. In his soul, in his warrior’s heart, Cassian was good in a way Nesta knew most people were not. In a way she knew she was not and would never be.He was not a warrior who killed on a whim, but a male who carefully considered every life he had to take. Who’d defend what he loved until death.”The relationships & ships:Nesta & Cassian:”You can keep that sharpness I like so much, that boldness and fearlessness. I don’t want you to ever lose those things, to cage yourself.”“But I still don’t know how to fix myself.”“There’s nothing broken to be fixed,” he said fiercely. “You are helping yourself. Healing the parts of you that hurt too much – and perhaps hurt others, too.”The banter between those two was legit one of the best things about this book. I really liked how they went back and forth and how they were able to hold their ground, but as I already said at the beginning of this review: I think it would have been better if Sarah wouldn’t have focused so much on the sex scenes. I get why she did it, but to be frank, after the 3rd time they said “It’s only sex, no feelings involved.” the reader already got that it’s not just sex and that there are plenty of feelings involved! You didn’t have to add even more “mind-blowing sex scenes” to show this, we already got it after the second time. I mean I’m the last to complain about sex scenes, I love good smut in my books but a couple less steamy scenes and a stronger focus on the plot instead definitely wouldn’t have hurt this book. You feel me? Aside of that I really liked the moments when Nesta and Cassian got closer and opened up to each other. Nesta had a severe trauma from being forced into the Cauldron and becoming fae but Cassian was very patient with her and understood her on a level no one else did. He was nourishing and pushy at the same time. Giving her enough space to grate on him whenever she needed it, but also offering her comfort when she was vulnerable. It was truly beautiful to watch those two find their way together and I think their dynamic was awesome. Nesta had a lot to work through in this book, the grief of losing her humanity and her father, the trauma of being made, the feeling of helplessness, of failing her sisters when they needed her the most, of almost being raped,. It was a whole can of worms to get through and with the help of her friends and Cassian she eventually made it. She’s still far from okay, but she’s on the right way and she can work on getting better now. Did I already mention how much I loved it that Sarah slowly but steadily let Nesta work through her trauma. It was very realistic and I’m glad we got to experience her character growth. And of course Nesta and Cassian are quite the formidable couple. *lol* I can’t wait to see more of them now that they are finally in tune. ;-)”Cassian stood beside her through all of it. Not speaking, not touching. Just there, should she need him. Her friend – whom she’d asked to come her with her not because he was sharing her bed, but because she wanted him here. His steadiness and kindness and understanding.”Elain & Lucien & Az & Gwyn:”Nesta met the shadowsinger’s stare and he gave her a nod. Then his gaze shifted to Elain, and though it was utterly neutral, something charged went through it. Between them. Elain’s breath caught slightly, and she gave him a shallow nod of greeting before brushing past, leading Nesta into the room.”Okay, I’m going to be completely honest here so WHAT THE HELL IS THIS WEIRD LOVE QUADRANGLE?! I don’t get it and I have absolutely no idea where Sarah wants to go with this. Like is there something going on between Az and Elain? In ACOFAS it looked like they were attracted to each other and we got some hints in ACOSF too. (see quote above) But then Gwyn is introduced and there obviously is some chemistry between her and Az too. That quote about him being her new ribbon, her teasing him and him being amused by it. Plus he saved her and is the only man she seems to trust. And let’s not forget about the fact that Elain is actually Lucien’s mate. Uff! So let’s speak some truth here: I would totally board the Gywn/Az ship and I’d ship them both so much you’d never see the end of it. *lol* But that would leave Lucien with Elain and I just CAN’T ship him with her because she’s so damn horrible to him it even hurts Cassian and Az when they see how she treats him. And that says a lot because he isn’t exactly their favourite person either, but at least they seem to have more sympathy for Lucien than Elain ever will. She treats him so badly it always causes me to wince when I read about their interactions. Small as they might be. My Lucien deserves so much better than that and I’ll never ship Elain with Lucien. NEVER! Sarah can try to come up with the most genius character arc for Elain but she won’t be able to save that ship. Period. For a while I actually thought there might be something going on between Lucien and Vassa but as it seems Jurian and Vassa are more likely to end up together? I got the impression Lucien is sort of third-wheeling with those two? I swear if Sarah doesn’t create a worthy love interest for Lucien in her next book I’ll riot! To be honest the only two people I’d ship Lucien with right now are actually Vassa or Az. Yes, you read right. *LOL* I’d ship Lucien with Az because I think they would work well together, but knowing Sarah she won’t go for an m/m couple. Her LGBTQIA+ characters are always side-characters that have a couple of lines. I mean just look at Mor. She made her bi, just to NOT explore her character even more. We’ve known Mor is bi since the third book, but nothing ever happened ever since. No love interest, nothing. Pff... The day has yet to come when Sarah J. Maas actually goes for a queer main character representation in her books. I mean if she doesn’t want to write them, okay, but please don’t lead us on. It’s not fair. Anyway! I really don’t know where Sarah wants to go with this love quadrangle, but I guess we’ll find out one day...”He and Lucien did not exchange gifts, though the male had brought a gift for Feyre and one for his mate, who barely thanked him after opening the pearl earrings. Cassian’s heart strained at the pain etching deep into Lucien’s face as he tried to hide his disappointment and longing. Elain only shrank further into herself, no trace of that newfound boldness to be seen.”Nesta, Gwyn & Emerie::”I wish for us to have the courage to go out into the world when we are ready, but to always be able to find our way back to each other. No matter what.”The friendship bond between those three was so amazing and I’m very glad we finally have a female counterpart to the Rhys/Cassian/Az trio. It was about time Sarah tackled the topic of a strong crew of girls and I was totally ready to explore their friendship. I’m sure they will bring the Valkyries back to glory and each and every single one of those women is a force to be reckoned with. They are strong and feisty and they will never ever back down again. They all had their own trauma, whether it was Nesta’s Cauldron experience, Emerie’s abuse through her father or Gwyn getting raped after witnessing her sister’s death... I hurt so much with those women, because knowing what they had to go through, what caused them to hide from the world was so heart-breaking and horrible. To see them fight back and make room for themselves, the way they got through their trauma and tackled every challenge head-on, it was truly inspiring and I loved all of them so much. They totally grew on me and them talking about smutty books and men was so much fun. *lol* I really hope Emerie and Gwyn will both find true love one day, because they deserve it and I want nothing but happiness for them. Plus them going through the rite and fighting against all those brutes, actually winning the thing despite all the odds, WOW! Talk about strength! They kicked those men’s butts and I can’t wait to see what they’ll do in the next book. =) They’ve come such a long way and they haven’t reached their limits yet. Also is it just me or did anyone else also catch some queer vibes from Emerie when she spoke about Mor? *lol* Just saying... Anyway! Sarah did well with those three and their character arcs. They fought for their place in the world and I expect great things to happen! There were so many moments I had goose bumps and I’m ready to see them change the world! The Valkyries are back! And they are ready to kick some butts! XDGwyn whispered, “I am the rock against which the surf crashes.” Nesta straightened at the words, as if they were a prayer and a summons. Gwyn lifted the blade. “Nothing can break me.”Cassian’s throat tightened, and even from across the ring, he could see Nesta’s eyes gleaming with pride and pain.Emerie said, “Nothing can break us.” The world seemed to pause at the words.Conclusion:In some ways“A Court of Silver Flames”was exactly the kind of book I wanted to read, but in other respects it wasn’t. I’m having a hard time to rate this book because there were so many things I loved and enjoyed to read about like for instance Nesta’s character arc, the strong friendships and family bonds, the character growth of Gwyn and Emerie, the Valkyries etc. There were so many good things in this story, but unfortunately there also were some things and situations that didn’t sit well with me. Some character developments are getting more and more detrimental the longer the series continues and sometimes I just can’t help but wonder if the author is aware of what she’s doing to our beloved characters. The fact the plot was as thin as paper and didn’t add a lot to the overall storyline was clearly something I didn’t like as well so I’m feeling a little bit conflicted about how to rate this. I think at the end of the day the good outweighed the bad and I’ll go for 3,5 stars rounded up to 4. I just hope Maas will be able to turn the tide with book five and will focus a little more on the plot again. All told I still enjoyed “A Court of Silver Flames” and I’m ready for the next book. Fingers crossed it will be a good one.",4
578,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","”Mother above and Cauldron save me.”Yep, that’s exactly what I thought when I read another one of Feyre and Rhy’s naughty scenes! The words might have been the same; my thoughts came with an eye roll instead of pleasure though. As did a lot of other things while I read this novella. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoyed almost every second of this and it was really nice to spend some time with all those characters again BUT (yes, it’s a big but) there were a lot of things that didn’t sit well with me and you can bet your lovely behind on the fact that I’m going to point them out later on when I get to the spoilery parts of this review.Generally speaking this wasn’t bad. We got to see a little bit of our characters normal lives and I think we can all agree that after everything they went through they deserve some normalcy and happiness. It was nice to walk through Velaris, to go Solstice shopping with Mor and Feyre and to see those beloved characters interact with each other. They all survived the war and each and every single one of them is trying to cope with the aftermath. There are plenty of wounds that still need to heal and I’m kind of grateful Sarah decided to give her characters some room to come to terms with everything. So yes, this novella might not have a huge plot but definitely provides a good transition into the next series. ;-)Still, there were quite a lot of interesting dialogues and a bunch of things that either made me happy or caused me to get angry. Mostly it was the relationships between the characters and so this is exactly what I’m going to write about. Buckle up! This is going to be a hard ride! *lol*From here on out, I’ll talk about the relationships and ships of the characters, so this isn’t only going to be rant and gush feast but also a spoiler celebration! If you still continue to read and haven’t read ACOFAS yet, it’s at your own risk! Don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-)The relationships & ships:Feyre & Rhys:”But you are bothering – you’re both still working to make this peace last. Peace, Rhys. We have peace, and the true kind. Enjoy it – enjoy each other. You paid the debt before it was ever a debt.”I totally agree with Cassian and even though this might sound harsh now I still need to say it: I want them to enjoy each other too, but please not as the MCs of the following books. I love Feyre and Rhys, I really do, but I think from ACOWAR on out their character development was kind of detrimental. I already mentioned it in my review of ACOWAR and I’ll say it again Feyre’s and Rhys’s holier-than-thou attitude is beginning to get on my nerves. Feyre and her friends weren’t the only ones that suffered and it would be really nice if she’d get out of her pink bubble and would acknowledge the fact that others hurt too! It’s good that Rhys and her have each other but not everyone is as lucky as them and it would help to remember that they made mistakes too! Also if I read about “toes that curl” in Feyre’s boots one more time I’m going to be sick. Yes, we got it, Rhys is such a sexy male and they really love each other. If you ask me their story should have ended after ACOWAR because right now I have more negative feelings towards them than positive ones and this is actually kinda sad. >_< Okay, Feysand shippers are allowed to take out their pitchforks and torches now... Just give me a little head start, will you? ;-PFeyre & Lucien:”And what, exactly, does this Band of Exiles plan to do? Host events? Organize party-planning committees?”Lucien’s metal eye clicked faintly and narrowed. “You can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?”I think Feyre was a real bitch to Lucien in this book. And no, I’m not sorry for saying it out loud. After all someone has to do it and I don’t mind it being me. I mean if she really wants him to be friends with her, she has to accept that he has his own life and doesn’t want to depend on her and Rhys. If she’d be honest to herself she’d realize that Lucien isn’t welcome at her court and that he has his reasons to stay away from them. I think the only two people who feel real sympathy for Lucien are Az and Amren and they only do it to some extent. So yeah, she can’t expect him to be happy with the situation. Lucien lost so much over the centuries and now he even lost Tam and his second home. It’s not Feyre’s call to decide what’s best for him! Especially because she’s actually the reason why Lucien isn’t welcome at Tam’s place anymore. So nope, take care of your own court and leave Lucien be! Thank you very much! And a huge YAY for Lucien! Because he dared to call Feyre and Ryhs out on their bullsh*t and didn’t back down! That’s my man!!! <333 Also I totally agree with him! Rhys shouldn’t have said what he did and the way he treated Tam cost him a lot of my sympathy.”Your mate should have known better than to kick a downed male.””I can’t stand to be in the same room as her for more than two minutes. I can’t stand to be in this court and have your mate pay for the very clothes on my back.”Elain & Lucien:”He hadn’t mentioned Elain, or his proximity to her. Elaine had not asked him to stay, or to go. And whether she cared about the bruises on his face, she certainly hadn’t let on.”So if you already put away your pitchforks and torches, guess now is the right time to draw them out again, because this isn’t going to be nice and tell you what: I actually don’t care! I’ll say it as it is: I HATE Elain! There, I said it! And I’m not even sorry for it! You think Nesta is a witch? Oh well, guess Elain is even worse because she hides it behind her super sweet appearance and gentle actions. By now I’ve reached a point where I despise her and I’m sick and tired of everyone defending this woman just because she is so sweet! Where was Elain when Feyre was taken by Tam? What did Elain do when Feyre went out hunting for them? Nesta might be a witch, and I can’t even believe I’m saying this, but at least she went looking for Feyre. What did Elain do? She got engaged to Grayson! YAY! Way to go! Also everyone loving precious and dear Elain! WTF?!!! Did Elain ever do anything except of looking lovely?! (Yes, she might be a great cook and good at gardening but seriously is that all!???!!!) AND WHY THE FREAKING HELL IS EVERYONE DEFENDING ELAIN WITH THE WORDS “Elain is Elain”!??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN!!?? I’m sick and tired of her getting away with everything because she’s everybody’s darling! Lucien deserves so much better than that! She can’t even talk to him for a few minutes? She can’t even thank him for the present he got her? Where was her present for him?! And just for the record: LUCIEN DIDN’T WANT HER TO BE HIS MATE!!! He’s as innocent when it comes to their mating bond as Elain! It’s not his fault that they are mates and people better remember this when they judge him for trying to get to know her! She doesn’t even give him a chance to get to know her so she’s just cruel and mean in my eyes. If she doesn’t change her attitude in the next trilogy I’ll never ship her with anyone. Not even Az. No one! For all I care she can live with her precious flowers and become one of them! GRRRRRRR!!!! AKDFASDFJASLDFJKASDFLK! Okay, I’m fine now. XD”Elain, at least, would be too polite to send Lucien away when he wanted to help. She was too polite to send him away on a normal day. She just ignored him or barely spoke to him until he got the hint and left.”Those doe-brown eyes turned toward me. Sharper than I’d ever seen them. “And that entitles him to my time, my affections?”“No.” I blinked. “But he is a good male.” Despite our harsh words. Despite this Band of Exiles bullshit. “He cares for you.”“He doesn’t know me.”“You don’t give him the chance to even try to do so.”Cassian & Nesta:”A storm is going to hit in a few days. I’d like you to distribute this amongst those who might feel its impact the hardest.”Cassian is so, so damn precious and he’s stuck with Nesta! That’s not fair! I think when it comes to me disliking characters in this series it’s a tie between Nesta and Elain. I just hate them both. (I know I’m making a lot of friends with this review. *lol* But I just can’t help it!) I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to ship them but after seeing that Nesta still didn’t change... Well, I just can’t ship them. By now I don’t even know if her character can be redeemed and if Sarah doesn’t work her magic with her I’ll never board this ship. And it will take a HUGE amount of magic to make her character at least a little bit more likable! And to everyone out there who likes Nesta and thinks I’m mean: I know she has PTSD too and I know that she suffers at least as much as all the other characters around her do, but that’s no reason to lash out at the others. If she wants to be secluded from them, live in a cheap apartment, drink all day and sleep with every fae male that comes her way: Okay! But to hurt the others, to fight them even though they are trying to help her, to spend Feyre’s and Rhys money without asking them: That’s not okay!! How many people have to offer her help until she accepts it? How often will she hurt poor Cassian because she’s just too proud to acknowledge that she has a serious problem? Just like Lucien, Cassian deserves so much better than her and I think I’ll make a petition for both of them! #FreeCassian&LucienFromTheClutchesOfTheCruelArcheronSisters”Nesta is Nesta. She does what she wants, even if it kills her sister. I’ve offered her job after job, and she refuses them all.”Tamlin & Rhys:Forgiveness could be a gift to both, but what he’d done... “Do you want her to?”His green eyes were empty. “Do I deserve it?”No. Never.He must have read it on my face, because he asked, “Do you forgive me – for your mother and sister?”I’m not okay with the way Rhys treated Tamlin! Yes, he made mistakes, yes he hurt Feyre, but that doesn’t mean that they have to hurt him too! Rhys should have known better than that, he should have been better than that and he shouldn’t have kicked Tam when he was already on the ground. Everyone can see that Tamlin is hurting and to treat him like that? To say what Rhys said to him? WOAH!! That was just cruel, mean and uncalled-for. I’m feeling really sorry for Tam now and Rhys helping him with the elk doesn’t make this any better. He only helped him because he might need him in future, not because he actually cared. Where is your compassion for Tam, Rhys? Where is the Rhys of ACOMAF I fell in love with? I don’t see him anymore. *shakes head*”I hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here. It’s a far more satisfying end than slaughtering you.”Elain & Az:Cassian sat up, the portrait of outrage. “No?”Azriel tucked in his wings. “Would you want people betting on you?”I think the only reason Az reacted like that is because he might feel guilty for liking Elain. It’s so obvious that Sarah wants them to end up together and all those little tense moments between them speak volumes about her intentions. But as I said: I can’t ship Elain with anyone right now. Az is too sweet and gentle to end up with her and I really don’t want them to be together. Not because I would begrudge him a relationship with her, but because I think that he deserves better than her. After Mor played with him for centuries Az deserves the world, and then some! If Elain doesn’t change and acknowledges her misbehaviour against Lucien then I can’t ship this ship. And quite honestly, if I’d be Az I wouldn’t want to be with someone who treats their mate like that.”Azriel emerged from the sitting room, a glass of wine in hand and wings tucked back to reveal his fine, yet simple black jacket and pants.I felt, more than saw, my sister go still as he approached. Her throat bobbed.”Rhys & Lucien:”I can let go of the taunts,” he said, scanning my face. “And the fact that he still harbors some hope of one day reuniting with Tamlin. But I cannot let go of how he treated you after Under the Mountain.”I’m just glad that Lucien became friends with Vassa and Jurian because as I already mentioned above, he obviously isn’t welcome at the Night Court. Rhys still doesn’t like him and Lucien deserves more than to be tolerated. He deserves to be respected, to be loved and cherished and not to be treated like sh*t! Also what the hell does Rhys even mean with how he treated Feyre after Under the Mountain? Lucien did nothing wrong, he was there for her, tried to help her, defended her against Tam, spoke up for her and confronted Tamlin. And what did he get in return? Tamlin reprimanded him and might have even physically hurt him, Ianthe abused him and Tam let it happen because he refused to take part in the ritual, and Feyre?! Do I really have to point out what Feyre did? She lied to him, claimed that Rhys had turned her and even after she came back to the spring court she continued to lie to him and hurt him even more by destroying the only place he called home. Hell, she even used him to antagonize Tam and to destroy his friendship with Lucien. A great friend she was to him! And this after everything he did for her Under the Mountain. Hell, he even got whipped because he helped her and almost died as well. To destroy your friends’ life is a great way to show him gratitude. Well done, Feyre! So WHO EXACTLY TREATED WHOM LIKE SH*T AFTER UNDER THE MOUNTAIN, RHYS???!!!! Mhmm??? Care to enlighten me? And one more thing before I come to the end of thisrantreview: Lucien was in no position to help Feyre because he suffered from PTSD too. That’s something everyone always seems to forget. You can’t help someone else if you’re drowning yourself. And people better keep that in mind before they talk badly about him.Conclusion:I really thought I’d enjoy this novella and then move on to the next trilogy but for some reason those 229 pages kinda irked me. Big time. *lol* I guess that’s mostly due to the fact that all the things I already criticized in ACOWAR seemed to be even more prominent in this short story and I just couldn’t ignore it any longer. Also all the chapters we got from Mor’s POV didn’t contribute anything to the story, which is the main reason I didn’t even mention her in my review. All told this was a nice addition to the first trilogy and a good segue into the next one and I really hope that Sarah J. Maas will tackle all those issues I just pointed out. After all, “Hope dies last”! ;-PThis fanart was made by:https://twitter.com/Niruskyart",3
579,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","✨Hardcore SJM fans need not engage, kindly move along without reading this review.✨Me after finishing the book:IM FREEEEEE!!!!!!!! WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY FUCKING LIFESo let’s start by sayingthis book wasalmostentirely useless.Things this book has:• lots of walking around Velaris• shopping for presents• lots of bad innuendos• me physically rolling my eyes every two pages• way too much internal monologue about who had fucked whom, where and in which position• one really long and really cringy sex scene•somehow galaxies were involved in the sex scene and that’s not even the weirdest thing that’s ever happened in a sjm sex scene• mate mate mate mate mate m a t e ma te ma t e mat e m ate mAtE mATe MATE matE M a te• ""gentlemales""• I repeat:g e n t l e m a l e s• a few cute moments• a few funny moments•a tiny bit of actual fucking foundation for the next booksBasicallyFeyre and Rhys need to retireand let secondary characters finally have the spotlight.* The only POVs I genuinely enjoyed were Cassian’s and Nesta’s, which, surprise surprise, will be the focus of the next book. Fucking finally.*except SJM has a talent for ruining main characters so what happens when secondary characters become the main ones? Uhhh we shall find out I guess.Speaking more generally,this book was just mostly bad.I’m not only talking aboutthe writing, whichneeded a lot of editing, but the general feeling surrounding it all. Starting from the blurb, which is just a few sentences from the first chapter copypasted together. People, the blurb doesn’t even make sense. That extra sentence about snow? It shouldn’t be there. They obviously needed one more sentence to make the blurb longer and didn’t know what else to pick. It’s just bad. Whoever did that did a very poor job.* And that makes me angry.*EDIT: oh boy they changed the blurb!!! More than a full week after the book released! But I got receipts. #NeverForgetTheBlurbAuthors, even big ones, still have to fight hard to see their books picked up by publishers, be sold, and then be read and hyped by readers. But apparently that rule doesn’t apply to SJM.The publisher doesn’t even put any effort in pre-release things like writing a decent blurb, because they know her books are going to sell anyway. And I mean, I’m here writing this review because I’ve read this book despite swearing that I was done with this series after ACOWAR, because she has a talent for making you want to know what happens to the characters, even if (especially if) they’re not the main ones.But the least the author and the publisher could do is put some fucking effort and deliver a product that’s better than this. Instead, it feels likeeither SJM is a rare case of writer who gets worse every book she writes, or the publisher has decided that she’s still going to sell regardless how many rounds of editing her books get,so they might as well never edit them, thus never delivering a polished book.Because, folks, we might have started making fun of the wordm*tefor shits and giggles, but it’s become a big fucking problem, especially in this book. You know the writing advice that says to just use someone’s name when talking about them, instead of saying, idk, “the French girl,” or “the red-haired boy”? SJM has never heard of it. Think about your own internal monologue. Do you think of your spouse as “my spouse” all the time? Or do you simply think about them with their name?Cassian and my mate’s sister did not speak to each other at all.This sentence just does not flow. And it’s just one of about 70 times the word m*te was used (and keep in mind this is a 200 pages book).I wonder how many creative writing students failed their assignments for doing exactly what the most hyped YA fantasy author these days does constantly.Do we also want to have The Talk about theweird connotations and implicationsthat this word has? Oh boy, this conversation is about three years late, but I absolutely Do Not like all this animalistic shit, starting with m*te, moving on to how many times people purr, referring to people as males and females (ah, the good ol’ binary) (YES I FUCKING KNOW SHE CAN’T CALL THEM MEN AND WOMEN BUT JFC JUST STOP), to the weird possessiveness that the whole m*ting system entails. Also!!! Toxic masculinity!!!!!!! Weird unchallenged sexist comments!!!!! Trying to make Rhys sound soooo feminist when apparently his job is being horny 24/7!!!!!! Have Rhys (a literal sexual abuse victim) talk about how hecan’t standto be next to his m*te without, and I quote, BEING BURIED INSIDE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ohhhh now you've done it, you got me mad. If you read a SJM book it seems like thinking/talking/having sex for most part of your day is the normalcy. Which it can be!!!! But guess what! Ace people exist!!!! People with low sexual drive exist!!!!!!!!!! That’s normal too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh no I’m using too many exclamation points let me hire an editor. When every single character you portray acts the same exact way towards something like sex, you’re telling your readers (mostly teens) that that’s what’s expected of them, that that’s how everyone is like. It’s no secret that diversity doesn’t exist in SJM’s world, and that involves how people view sex and romantic relationships too.It’s amazing that YA books have sex positivity.But books need to also acknowledge that ace people exist too. Protagonists and love interests that aren’t some sort of sex gods need to be there too. Thin boys, fat boys, trans boys need to be there too.If after >10 books a writer can’t get out of her own self-insert fantasies about what type of men she likes, maybe she isn’t a great writer after all.Maybe she needs to listen to the (still too small) part of her readers that demand More, that demand Better.I went on a HUGE tangent and I don't even fucking care. There were parts of the book that I liked. I even enjoyed most of its central part. I enjoyed Nesta’s PTSD portrayal and she’s the only reason I’m going to read the next book because parts of her trauma and her way of dealing with it have the potential to mean so fucking much to me. But I’m going to lower my rating to 1 star because I’m tired of all the things I mentioned above,I'm tired of being treated like shit by an author and her team because they expect me to worship her when she doesn't even try anymore.My 1 star isn't even gonna change anything because everyone’s giving this the usual five stars, but I don’t care. I’m here and as a readerI demand better, I demand the bare fucking minimum, and I don’t think this book even tried.This was a buddy read withmy bon m@te(I’m sorry)____Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't blurbs, like, tell you something about the book..........why is this one just a recap of the previous ones lmaoAlso shout-out to sjm for managing to squeeze the word ""mate"" within like 100 words of bad blurb",1
580,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","#1A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★★#2A Court of Mist and Fury★★★★★#3A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★★★#3.5A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★★★First of all, let me just express my total devastation that an entire year of counting down the days until this book’s release isgonein two and a half hours of reading. I mean, I knew it was only going to be a novella, but… *sobs quietly*I didn’t expect it to go by THAT fast!This amazing little series has pulled me through some really dark times and brought so much joy into my life that I know I will treasure it, always. ♥Even now, with that bond again flowing between us like a river of star-flecked night, the echo of its vanishing lingered.ACOFAS definitely doesn’t read anything like the 3 main novels; the chapters switch perspectives occasionally, featuring POVs from Feyre, Rhysand, Cassian, and Morrigan. What struck me as particularly odd about this was the fact that Feyre and Rhysand’s chapters were in first-person, while Cassian and Morrigan’s were in third—a slightly jarring writing style, but nothing too detrimental.In his stare, I could have sworn galaxies swirled. In the shadows between his wings, the glorious depths of the night dwelled.We do get some really sweet and domestic Feysand moments, but I was actually surprised at how little time they actually spend together during the novella (and how little sex there is—who is this author and what did she do with Sarah?!). We did finally get the infamous wall scene! There are some incredibly sweet moments, at least a few scenes of Rhysand being his lovable cinnamon roll self, and a completely expected but adorable turn of events for their little family.Shadows different from anything my powers summoned, spoke to. Born in a lightless, airless prison meant to break him. Instead, he had learned its language.Feysand obsession aside, I loved how much time we got to spend with Cass and Az, learning more about their respective histories and how they’ve healed from the war. With Cassian’s perspectives especially, it felt like this was written to be a legitimate “bridge” between the ACOTAR series and whatever comes next, which I was honestly fond of, even if the next book’s focus on Cassian and Nesta does have me pretty nervous.Lucien had not come here to make amends during Solstice, I realized as Tamlin opened the door to the dark library. Lucien had come here out of pity. Mercy.Perhaps the most unexpected bits were the ones in which we visited Tamlin—with a novella this short, I honestly didn’t expect to see him at all, and certainly not in the state in which Rhysand found him. I never thought I would feel sorry for him, and I still think he’s a walking, talking garbage can, but I still couldn’t help being at least a little bit sad to see how far he’s fallen. I truly do hope that Sarah will write more about him in the future, because I can’t help but always feel that, no matter what a jerk he is, there’s something interesting about his potential as a character.Cassian set me down at last. “What’d you get me for Solstice?” I smacked his arm. “A heaping pile of shut the hell up.”Was ACOFAS everything I hoped and dreamed it would be? Honestly, no. This is more of a 4.5 rating, but you can believe that I did not hesitate to round up to 5 stars, because at the end of the day, I got to spend a few hundred pages with my precious bat babies, and watch this adorable little family interact and taunt and fuss and cry and laugh with one another, and that was all I reallyneededthis novella to offer me. I have missed the inner court so damn much since ACOWAR ended, and it just felt SO GOOD to fall right back into this world for a little bit longer. ♥Bonus list of tiny things that made me squeal:→ the sauna scene→ snowball fight traditions→ more “the power of art” scenes→ Morrigan reminiscing (ow, my heart)→ Amren’s newfound jigsaw puzzle obsession→ “Illyrian babies”→ Rhys cooking Tamlin dinner, like… what even?→ all the fuzzy scarves and winter holiday vibes→ Amren receiving a million pieces of jewelry as always→ Mor’s terrible taste in gifts→ SHAMELESS reference to Cass’ wingspanYou can find this review and more on myblog, or you can follow me ontwitter,bookstagram, orfacebook!",5
581,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","Just published my latestBookTube Video- so excited to share it!!The Written Review*cue the undiluted screams of joy*Okay. Okay. I willtryto be objective about this one but I just finished ACOWAR and I am still riding that emotional high.To summarize:for a companion novel - not bad at all. It's full ofcotton-candy fluff,and I devoured every single bite.Now, this one was a bitheavy on the smutand a bit light on the Nessian but it definitely hadall the right feelsin all the right places.Stars flickered around us, sweet darkness sweeping in. As if we were the only souls in a galaxy.For those who don't know (and are curious) this novel sprang from avery drunk conversationbetween Sarah J. Maas (aka the Maaster) and her publisher.Maas confessed that in her free time that she wrote fanfiction of her work. Just little drabbles of what happened in between ACOWAR and her next novel. The publisher thought,we could sell that...And thus, this novel was born.So, keeping the origins in mind,I really liked this novel.There wasn't a big-bad or end-of-the-world subplot, not much plot development happened BUT this was afun and lightheartedread.And honestly, after ACOWAR, these charactersdeservea fewmonthsyears off from the doom-and-gloom.“Dangerous words, Rhysand,” Amren warned, strutting through the door, nearly swallowed up by the enormous white fur coat she wore. Only her chin-length dark hair and solid silver eyes were visible above the collar. She looked—“You look like an angry snowball,” Cassian said.Feyre and friends are spending theirfirst winter solstice(aka Christmas without Christ) together. And despite the warmth of the hearth, not all of the winter chill is kept out.Feyre frets aboutreuniting her family.Rhysand freaksout about what to buy her (Solstice and birthday presents!!).Mor isabsolutely terribleat expressing her feelings (and gift-giving in general).And Amren makes outlike a bandit(mostly cause everyone knows what to buy her - priceless jewels).And, of course,Nesta being Nestamade this novel shine.Every time she and Cassian are in the same room the dynamic between them is just perfect.He'd seen Nesta in that particular pose, too. He called it her I Will Slay My Enemies pose.Cassian had named about two dozen poses for Nesta at this point. Ranging from I Will Eat Your Eyes for Breakfast to I Don't Want Cassian to Know I'm Reading Smut. The latter was his particular favorite.I know this is just a companion novel and that there won't be much development in terms of relationships but c'mon Sarah J. Maas.Throw us a bone.(Actually, if you read the sneak peek at book 4 included at the end, I suppose she does offer us a bit of relationship hints).I am soemotionally investedin this series right now. I wish I could just time-machine myself into next year for book 4. But until I get that working, this companion novel will certainly tide me over.P.s. I got to read the hand-stamped version of Sarah J. Maas's book. All I could think of the whole time was -ohmygosh.

582,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","Reread March 2022Original rating: ⭐️⭐️New rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️Rereading this before jumping into ACOSF, I can definitely better appreciate the set-up to a new conflict. But if you read this just as an epilogue to the ACOTAR trilogy, it's just pointless and cringy fan service. If I have to read the words ""illyrian babies"" one more time it will actually induce vomiting.-----Original review, May 2018:we were all played like a violin in investing in this book. It’s $18 for lazy, messy fanfiction. This is 200+ pages of complete emptiness. There’s no purpose to any of this other than a money grab and longwinded, unnecessary epilogue to the original trilogy.This literally reads like someone from Tumblr wanted a scene with all the ACOTAR characters having christmas together so sarah whipped out her laptop. There was no substance or set-up to a new series at all. 90% of this book—and I wish I was kidding—is just the characters all going shopping for each other's presents--multiple times. The other 10% is Feyre and Rhys speaking in each other’s heads through the bond about how much they want to fuck each other. Additional scenes include the characters getting drunk every 30 pages, weird side POVs from characters who add nothing to the story, and a snowball fight between warriors. I honest to God am not joking when I say if I read this on fanfiction.net, I would laugh at it and say it’s unrealistic and poorly done. It’s just pure stupidity and vapid smut for the fans’ wish fulfillment.The writing in this is so messy. “Gentlemales” brought me to a depth of hell I haven’t seen before, so thanks for that, Sarah. Every time a female character says something “softly, but not weakly,” I feel like plunging a knife into my chest. Take a shot every time Sarah’s written that into one of her books. The sex scenes have so much potential to be steamy or whatever but Sarah ruins it by having the characters CONSTANTLY horny for each other, so it dampens any tension or angst. And the amount of times that sex is referenced in Rhys’s POV is utterly repulsive. At one point he justlooksat a table and is like “mmm I’d fuck Feyre on that” ... [john mulaney voice] FUCKING WHAT?? Even in Feyre’s POV when I could get away from his gross thoughts, he’d always talk shit to her down the bond and try and get in her pants or say something “sexy” but it’s just so corny and stupid and gross and it ruins the scene and I wanted to throw my book it was so irritating.I just think it’s funny how Feyre is the high lady and in Velaris, apparently women—oh, i’m sorry, FEMALES—are toootally equal to men *ahhem* males, and yet this entire book, Rhys is traveling to different courts and talking treaties and strategies with people and going off on business and Feyre does what? Cleans their home, goes shopping (no less than 4 times), cooks meals, and maybe if she’s feeling frisky, paints a little or has sex with her husband—oh, i’m sorry *ahhem*mate…. Sarah, don’t pretend that women are so equal to men but then literally only have female characters who love jewels and shopping and cooking and serving men and having sex. Even Amren didn’t slit a throat in this—she just complained about pooping and then had sex with Varian. Nesta and Lucien are the only vaguely interesting characters in this and I don’t like either of them. Their anger and distance made them more interesting than the characters in this getting shit-faced, making lame sexual jokes to each other, and referencing characters from the original trilogy I don’t care about.I wanted there to be something good about this because I genuinely loved ACOMAF and I’m waiting to feel a glimpse of the mastery that went into that book, but these new books just fan wish fulfillment at this point. This book was COMPLETELY unnecessary and the fact that Sarah is only extending the world to exploit the characters people like and get more money is just low. Let this series die, the world is done. The characters have exhausted their arcs and their humor is dumb and dry.Gave this book a star because Azriel deserves better than this bullshit.",3
583,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","Ok, it's time for an unpopular opinion. I'm sure I'll get nasty-grammed all the way until next year for this but.....I didn't enjoy this. Not in the slightest.Granted, this is all opinion based; there's nothing inherently wrong with this book, I just found myself bored from beginning to end. In fact, I felt like the chapter excerpt for book #4 in the back had more to offer than this entire ""novella"" provided in 220+ pages. If you loved this one, I truly am happy for you, but I felt the need to provide some honest feedback in case there are others who may have the same expectations that I did here. I'm going to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you haven't read the previous books in the series I would stop here.********************I'm actually having trouble writing anything about the plot because nothing really happens in the story, aside from one decision that is made between Feyre and Rhysand. I did appreciate that the author was trying to offer a brief entrance back into the world she had created, and if this had been the beginning to a larger, 700+ page novel then I would have looked at this in a completely different light. I hate that I was expecting something to happen because it detracted from my ability to just enjoy being with these characters again as they shop for presents for each other and describe the food they are eating and recap everything we just read in the previous novel. But truly, if all you are looking for is atmosphere then you will likely enjoy this much more than I did. The descriptions of Velaris and the Illyrian war camps are breathtaking and exquisite.I did wholly appreciate the bit of backstory we get into Cassian initially, and my heart bled for Mor as she kept having to deal with her father and Eris and the Court of Nightmares, but every time I thought we were finally getting somewhere it would switch back over to shopping and food discussions. So I have to give credit to the fact that I was engaged in those moments, regardless of how the flow affected my absorption of the story. I was so disappointed in this disjointed lack of connection that I couldn't believe I was reading about the same inner circle I had once held so dear.Have I possible ""outgrown"" this series? I would hope not, because it's one of my favorite escapes, so I've come to the conclusion that a big factor is this:I'm tired of Feyre and Rhysand.It's not like I never want to hear about them, but I am so done with their narrative. It has come to the point where it feels repetitive and stale and dull and every single other character in this book, aside from a little bit of Cassian/Mor/Nesta was mostly left out. I wanted to hear more from all these other characters, from other courts spread across the continent, fromANYTHING BUT FEYRE AND RHYS.You know what I think the strongest point this novella has going for it?SJM actually made me feel a bit of conflicted sorrow for Tam Tam.I will never excuse abuse or the things he did wrong previously, but she managed to touch a tiny place inside my heart that wished for more for ole Tammy, that he could find someone to accept his brokenness and help heal him into a functioning member of fae society.I'm sorry as I'm completely aware that this review is just a bundle of disjointed thoughts (how's that for irony?), but it's the best I could do under the circumstances. Guys, I'll still read the next book, as I'm interested in the Nesta/Cassian deal, but I sincerely hope that we see more Elain/Lucien/Azriel, because I missed my precious babies. I really did.Ok, NOW you can throw your pitchforks and knives at me, I'm done!;)",2

Let the Solstice festivities begin.""1) A court of thorns and roses ★★★★☆2) A court of mist and fury ★★★★★2) A court of wings and ruin ★★★★★A perfect, fluffy and heart-warming novella, from the first to the last page.A court of frost and starlight focuses once more on Feyre and Rhysand and I couldn't be happier about it. I know many people weren't happy about getting another book about them but they still hold a special place in my heart soa new whole canon book about them?It felt like Christmas morning for me lol.Besides that, from my point of view the book is more aboutseeing the inner circle heal after the warthan feysand. Some dealt with it better than others but everyone has its own scars.I loved seeingthe progression of Feyre and Rhysand's relationship,they're my all time favorite fictional couple and seeing them happy and making plans for the future was amazing, after everything they went through they deserve it and no one can convince me otherwise. Plus, it was good to seeold Rhyscoming back, he was kind of less funny and flirty in acowar (understandably).It's true,the plot was basically non existent but I mean ... uhm what were you expecting?I lost count of how many times Sarah said the whole book's purpose was giving a deserved ending to the feysand arc and creating a bridge between the two series. That's exactly what she did so I don't get the amount of hate I'm reading about this topic.Plus, the final excerpt confirmed thatthe next book is gonna be nessian'sand I liked how Sarah set up the two of them (especially Nesta, her story arc in acofas is soooo dark). And I know that many people weren't happy with her arc but for me seeing her hitting rock bottom was the perfect set up for the next book, she has her own healing to go through (Cassian does too).",5

She's my favourite author. Her books have brought about this sense of utter calm and happiness within me every time I read and think about them.This novella was everything we needed to potentially see the direction the other books will go in. And boy, am I beyond excited for it!I'm sure we'll be getting more of Cassian and Nesta in the next book and Sarah J Maas does character development ridiculously well and my god, being able to look forward and dream about their character exploration makes me too excited for words.I loved that we got see more of the Inner Circle. They are, hands down, my favourite bunch of fictional characters. I feel like I'm part of the family. I'm so glad some lighthearted, happy and sweet, tender moments were included in this. The family aspect between them all felt too real, and so good to read. And so worthy of them to have after the events of ACOWAR.And the emphasis on art in this book and seeing Feyre getting back into it as a form of healing for herself and others was a dream. Her dreams were finally actualised.The progression from ACOWAR to this felt natural and the cities and its people (including our main lot) were still healing, still too traumatised from the war. But progress was being made and I can't wait to see how that will be looked at in the upcoming spin-off series.I think at this point people are more interested in the progression of other characters. I'm here for it, but I don't ever see myself tiring of Feyre and Rhys and the bond between them! Chapter 22 is all I'm going to say. After having lost so much, they better still have that puppy-love going.I loved it. I absolutely loved it!------------------------------------PRE-RELEASE RAMBLINGS!!My body is ready!

(i had very much forgotten that she was only 21, which did send me into a spiral of my own!) but we get to see her and the inner circle celebrate that and celebrate winter solstice together.this long novella really is the bridging book toA ​Court of Silver Flamesand i actually think it does a very good job prepping what is to come. we even get to see in cassian and nesta pov at the very end, which i had forgotten completely. but ultimately this really is a story about ptsd and grief and how those things look so very different in so many people. People experience things differently, people choose to show others how they are feeling differently, and people heal differently. i actually think this book does a very good job showing that and celebrating that in it’s own respectful way.i for sure think i appreciated this more the second time around! also, sjm just really knows how to write a cold atmosphere and winter setting, and the timing of this just really made for a good reading experience. i can’t wait to finally finish this series reread, leading up toHouse of Flame and Shadow!trigger + content warnings:a lot of talk of loss of loved ones in the past, talk of war, talk of murder and death, grief depiction, ptsd depiction, misogyny and sexism, extreme abuse in past / violence against women, talk of menstruation and painful/hard menstrual cycles, gore and violence in past, talk of weight loss, blood, animal death.[2018 first read]★★★♡old review on my blog“The first snow of winter had begun whipping through Velaris...”blog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon",3

That sucks because it's the responsibility of parents (not of Goodreads, not of the publishers and authors) to find out about the content of the EXPENSIVE books they buy for their underage kids. But how are they going to find that information when so many booktubers, common sense media and Goodreads members are hiding it?You can also find the information about the erotic content of this series on the american hardcover version of a court of mist and fury.Pages 21, 22A faery woman is descriptively fingered by someone different than the hero, then she has descriptive sex, then oral, descriptions of the fluids and the nudity and the action in vivid detail.Pages 471, 472, 473, 474. 475A faery woman is fingered to orgasm by the hero (different guy from the pages 21-22), partial nudity, but this scene takes a quite few pages and it's an erotic scene, not just a sex scenes, but the purpose seems to be to be to turn on the reader.Pages 530, 531, 532, 533, the orgasm that shatters the mountains:a pair of lovers heroine and hero have sex including oral, vidid description of the action, use of the word ""cock""Pages 538 and 539vivid descrption of oral (fellatio):P but they call it licking LOL.DISCLAIMER AND TRIGGERS WARNINGS:♣ IF YOU DON'T LIKE READING EROTIC/EXPLICIT CONTENT and don't tell me that you can skip the sex scenes, Most of us don't pay full hardcover price for skiping half the book ;)kidding, only A COURT OF MIST AND FURY book two is really erotica marketed as YA, the rest of the series is still explicit but not erotic♣ IF YOU THINK YOUNG ADULT IS A GENRE THAT SHOULD REMAIN CLEAN♣ IF YOU ARE 12-17 YO WHO DON'T LIKE TO READ EXPLICIT SEX SCENES♣ IF YOU DON'T LIKE LOVE TRIANGLES And MULTIPLE MALE LOVE INTERESTSBook 1 we have a love triangle: Tamlin vs Rhysand(there was a third male who Feyre was sleeping with, but it was just a fuck buddy who was engaged to marry OW)> winner: TamlinBook 2 We have a love triangle: Rhysand vs. Tamlin but it's really unevenfor a while it seems as though another high lord might create a love geometry but didn't happen. EXPLICIT SEX SCENES of heroine with both love interests: winner RhysandBook 3: NO LOVE TRIANGLE!Feyre and Rhys remain together, but there are other love triangles around and Rhys proposes a Male-Male-Female threesome to Feyre. Maybe he was joking, either way her reaction was unnecessarily enthusiastic for a woman who has already been sexually involved with 3 different men in the series and who is basically a newlywed. FeyRhys is still in their honeymoon period so why are they already joking about threesomes?♣ IF YOU DON'T LIKE ABUSIVE LOVE INTERESTS AND ABUSIVE WOMEN-Tamlin love interest of book 1? ABUSIVE!-Rhys, secondary love interest of book 1 andprimary love interest of books 2 and 3? Rhys tortured the heroine(there was a reason, though)ABUSIVE!- The sisters? Everyone talks about how Tamlin should apologize. When will the sisters apologize?Feyre's elder sisters let Feyre hunt for the family from a very early age, but they were always there reaping the benefits of Feyre's effort. When Feyre was going through an abusive relationship they kept receiving money from Feyre's abuser and didn't bother to find out how she wasABUSIVE!♣IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHEN sexual assault victims ARE THROWN UNDER THE BUS TO MOVE THE PLOT FORWARD. CAREFUL WITH DANGEROUS RAPE MESSAGESIt happens so much on New adult and adult literature (game of thrones, the girl with the dragon tatoo, the second book of the outlander series) a sexual assault victim gets the ""oh-you-were-raped?- don't- bitch- about- it- and- move- forward treatment. So many books trivialize the worst aspect of PTSD and sexual assault and try to ""sovle it"" either with revenge or the magic romantic relationship that will make everything go away. Or the experiences just get ignored and brush aside! This happens to Mor, a secondary character in the 3rd book who is a rape survivor whenshe's forced to work along with her attacker and the one who puts her through that was the hero of the story!To be fair, I can understand the circumstances, doesn't mean I have to like that kind of story line, especially when that's something that good editing could have taken care of. That kind of disrespect for rape was unneccessary IMO. It didn't move the plot forward and it's out of character for Rhys to act like that. I love Rhys and didn't like the way SJM made him act.♣ IF YOU BELIEVE ANY BOOK YOU PAY FOR SHOULD BE PROFESSIONALLY EDITEDI'm not a grammar nazi and my spelling is terrible, but I can tell you, even some fanfiction I've read has a more polished editing than this book. There's the overuse of words like mate. There are also problems with pace, repetitiveness, flow and consistency of the voices when changing from a narrator to the other and from a first person POV to a 3rd person POV. The characters sound too modern. The worldbuilding is not high fantasy at all. The setting of this series is pretty much like a modern series. All these are things that a content editor and a proofreader could have taken care off, but the publishers rushed publication lowering the quality of the editing and the writing. Even so they are selling this at full ebook price.My ratings for the series so far♣A Court of Thorns and Roses ACOTAR 3/5because abusive relationships, false advertising (it's new adult dishonestly marketed as young adult) and love triangle. My review is currently censored and hidden from the third page of review. It should appear somewhere between page 2 and 3.♣A COURT OF MIST AND FURY ACOMAF4/5 because I didn't appreciate the explicit sex scene with OM, but I highly recommend this book to my friends who don't mind safety issues and like explicit scenes in slow-burn-romance. This book is EROTICA (according to the goodreads description of the genre) marketed as YA.♣A COURT OF WINGS AND RUIN ACOWAR2.5/5 because poor editing, f bombs, repetitiveness, unnecessary sex scenes and dangerous messages. No, glorifying revenge and abusive women isn't female empowerment. No, in most marriage it isn't always the woman's choice, it's always the choice of both of them. My review is currently censored by goodreads.Sources of my pictures:AMAZON CANADA CHILDREN'S BOOKS ADVENTUREAMAZON CANADA CHILDREN'S BOOKS FANTASYAMAZON AUSTRALIA CHILDREN'S BOOKS LOVEBooktopia A COURT OF MIST AND FURY RECOMMENDED AGESEROTICA GENRE DEFINITION ACCORDING TO GOODREADSACOMAF RECOMMENDED TO CHILDREN 11-13 on audibleWHY YOU SHOULDN'T TRUST BOOKTUBERS AND THE YA GOODREADS CHOICE AWARDS REGARDNG THE CONTENT OF THIS BOOK?Because a vast majority of booktubers have failed so far to mention that this book series contains erotic/explicit content in their booktube reviews even though they always discuss ""young adult books"". It could be unintentionally. It could be intentionally. The reason doesn't matter. They're contributing to the false advertising.A fewbooktubers are being published or aspire to be published by the same IMPRINT of this new adult series. Others booktubers and bookbloggers seem to want good relationships with the publishing industry. They won't say anything that can hurt the marketing agenda of the big publishing houses.Note: Bookables, Benji Alderson and Polandbananas have mentioned this series is new adult , so of course a lot of booktubers are somehow honest, it's not cool calling out an entire community of readers because the dishonesty of a few bad apples. Distrust only the reviewers who call this series young adult.On the other hand, The Goodreads choice awards editors ignored the shelving system when they selected the categories for the goodreads choice awards last year. In the goodreads feedback group they told me that's how editors select categories: based on shelving.At the time of the awards this series was shelved primarily asfantasy and romanceby GR users, but still the editors made it compete on the young adult category. Not in romance (second most-shelved genre), not in fantasy (first most-shelved genre). They made it compete in young adult (third most-shelved genre followed closely by New adult)This review isn't meant to discouraging people from reading/buying the book. On the contrary. I'm inviting you to read this series if you don't have problems with sexual content and abusive relationships.Despite all the problems I have with the false advertising I enjoyed the trilogy. But again I'm warning you:♣ NEVER trust the information that you see on Goodreads, Common sense media. and booktube. Not all reviewers are independent and unbiased. Do your research.Life is too short and TBR piles are too big to just ignore the kind of information that can help us decide what we will read next. Goodreads shouldn't try to hide that information.People who pay $15-18 for a hardcover and $8-15 for an ebook of a young adult ""high fantas"" book have every right to expect:♣ 12-18 YO Main characters,♣ no F bombs♣ no explicit sex.♣ A profesionally edited book.That's not what any book of this series delivers.Update 02-24People aren't expecting something like this:For a series that is supposedly about women's choices,when Goodreads, Booktubers and Publishers hide this information from young girls they are taking away their right to decide when or if they would read erotic content. Not to mention they're contributing to the book being sold in the Children's section of multiple retailers.",1

Oh, no!Here's a quick blow-by-blow of this book's very worst offences:- Rhysand is a ""feminist"" if ""feminist"" means ""treat my wife like an orgasm dispenser""- the Night Court back at it again on their high horse- Tamlin's growth at the end of ACOWAR has been sucked away to the septic tank- Rhysand, a man who has gleefully carried out acts of torture and who encourages his military commanders to torture POWs, goes to chap at Tamlin's house to do nothing other than rub his face in the events of the trilogy- he's a grotesque hypocrite- anyone, ever, who tries to justify torture is morally bankrupt and it doesn't matter if he gave his wife lots of nice pep talks- he is a fucking torturer- and can we stop handwaving all of these characters' ""noble grudges""- stop kicking people when they're already down and we've already made our point- Tamlin has been punished enough- let it go and grow the fuck up- also we were fine with Feyre's PTSD because hers was beautiful and sad, but of course someone like Nesta who grievesinconvenientlydeserves nothing but scorn????- Nesta deserves better than these arseholes- I'm glad she's taking Rhysand's money and wasting it- I'm glad she's Moved On from these fake hoes- Amren is ruined- nothing fucking happened in this book- N O T H I N GThis is a PSA: the Night Court can choke. Every last one of them. The magic and romance of ACOMAF has been exorcised away and all that's left is 200 pages of shopping and heteronormativity. The only character in this whole series who was halfway decent was Tarquin and of course he was cheated and lied to and treated like garbage by that fucking MELT Rhysand and his Shit Squad who do nothing all day but shop and bake bread and cry about their sad love lives and then dabble in some more fuCking TORTURE.My goD JUST DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS UNTIL I HAVE CALMED DOWN.",1

596,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","3/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Stars flickered around us, sweet darkness sweeping in. As if we were the only souls in a galaxy.”I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry.THIS BOOK FUCKING KILLED ME WITH BOREDOM. I swear to God, I'm dead now. My ghost is writing this review. I'm fucking dead because this book had no point in even existing. This book isn't even filler. It's nothing. I can't even describe it. This book was SUPPOSED to be the bridge between the old series and the new series. But like??? This book was just messy archiveofourown.org fanfiction. And not a good one. Not one I would give kudos to or write a comment under. One I wouldn't read at all. But now let's go to the summary of the book, which is also inadequate.Feyre, Rhys, and their close-knit circle of friends are still busy rebuilding the Night Court and the vastly-changed world beyond. But Winter Solstice is finally near, and with it, a hard-earned reprieve.Yet even the festive atmosphere can't keep the shadows of the past from looming. As Feyre navigates her first Winter Solstice as High Lady, she finds that those dearest to her have more wounds than she anticipated--scars that will have far-reaching impact on the future of their Court.See? Even the summary has nothing to prepare us for. As you all know, because I've been raving and raving about those books for a million years, this is the series which has reintroduced me to fantasy. This series holds a very special place in my heart and I have come to loveSarah J. Maasas an author, too. This book was unlike anything she has written. This book was clearly a money grab, fanservice sort of fanfiction book. Which added almost nothing to this series. Everything that happened in this book could be included in a 30 page snippet at the beginning of the fourth book of the series, and it would all be ok. But let's talk specifics.The plotLet's talk about the non-existentPLOT. This book was: shopping with Feyre, shopping with Mor, cooking with Elain, hardcore negotiations with Rhys, Az and Cassian, some good ol' fucking with good ol' Feyre and Rhys, and then again shopping, and then again some fucking, and some tension featuring Nesta,ARTwith Feyre, brooding with Tamlin, sexual tension with Cassian and Nesta, and let's not forget the epic new single....MATES, included in the new album byFeyre ArcheronandRhysand(who still doesn't have a surname)M.A.T.E.S.(masturbation anal testicles ejaculation sex) (wtf was that). Let's be real here. Every time I read this fucking word I want to off myself. This word is ruined for me. I can never hear a dudebro call another dudebro ""mate"" and not remember this. Let this word rest. Let this word die. Let this word becomeFrost and Starlight(see what I did there). JUST LET THIS WORD GO. WE KNOW THEY'RE MATES THEY'RE MATED FOR LIFE THEY'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER AND FOREVER NAH NAH NAH. Ugh. If I had one euro (yes I'm changing it from ""if I had a dollar"" if I had a fucking dollar I couldn't use it for anything) for every time the word ""mate"" is in this book, I would go to vacation to Santorini. It's expensive guys. You have no fucking clue how much.The POVsThis book added multiple perspectives of characters, which I found pretty interesting, but also unnecessary because nothing happens in this book and we don't need to see that nothing explained from multiple people, but you know, it happens. It confused me, though. We mostly see Feyre's and Rhys's POVs, in first person, and then we see some more characters' POVs like Cassian and Mor but... in third person. Which is really unsettling and baffling. And those chapters are such heartwreching and heartbreaking moments from their past, and in this book, it feels our of place. A book about the Winter Solstice which is basically Christmas, shopping, gifts exchanging, happy times, scenes like these seem unnecessary. I couldn't take them seriously, and I wanted to. Also, it seems like we're gonna get the next series with third person narration. Which is fine by me, but what's the point?The romanceI'm not a big fan of established and domestic relationships. Feyre and Rhysand literally murdered me in ACOMAF. The sexual tension, the eye fucking, the actual fucking, the ""things"" before the actual fucking, they made my little shipper heart die with happiness. And then... they became so canon, it hurts my soul. They don't interest me anymore. It's all sex and fucking and ""oh mate, my mate"" and ""oh how much I love you my Feyre"" and sky sex which was disturbing and like??? People can see you dude! You can fucking winnow and fly, just get her on a bed, or a wall (lol) or a sink or whatever floats your boat. I believe these characters's circle is over now. I'm truly excited for them to have a child but I guess we'll see everything from another people's POVs now. It's time now forCASSIAN AND NESTA. Oh man, how much I ship this. I'm so fucking board for this. They are my new Feyre and Rhys. I want this to happen so badly, I want to scream. Nesta pissed me off a lot in this book, but I will handle her for this ship. And because Cassian obviously loves her and I love Cassian with my entire soul. Furthermore, I don't know what to do with Elain, in terms of shipping. Az and Elain are cute af but I kinda want to explore the whole Elain and Lucien factor. Elain pisses me off, but I love Az and Lucien and I want to see them happy.TamlinThis book made Tamlin an unnecessary villain. It's like this book didn't have a plot or anything or someone to blame shit on so just blame it all on Tamlin. Don't get me wrong, I fucking hate his guts. I appreciated what he did in ACOWAR, he kinda redeemed himself, but I still don't like him. Nonetheless, there is no point in what's happening to him. Everyone is casting him out. He doesn't have any friends, his home is a graveyard, his people hate him. And you know, he isn't the worst. We've seen worst villains redeem themselves. He's just a controlling and manipulative asshole who can't control his temper. He didn't hurt Feyre or Rhys. I want to see what will happen to his character, but Sarah has villainized him too much.The humorThis book was funny af. Hence my rating. The Amren peeing scene, the sauna scene, the ""Illyrian babies"" scene, the painting Rhys nude scene, the Feyre and Cassian drunkly decorating scene, the gifts exchange scene. It was all hilarious and fluffy and happy and it's something I needed. I have come to love these characters so much and I feel their inner circle as my home. I was truly happy to see them domestic and healing their wounds after the war. But, nonetheless, there was not a book needed for this. All these scenes could have been included in the fourth book. But, you know, money is important.Basically, this book was a character driven tease which gave us nothing! Honestly, we see things beginning and then we are given NOTHING. I want to know, I want to know everything. This book was diverse to anything Sarah has ever written. I was expecting this BOOM to happen but nothing. A big huge pile of shit and nothing. The book fourth snippet at the end was the most interesting part of this book. We kinda see what the next series is gonna be about. But still, not ENOUGH. Honestly, people, don't pay money for this book. It was too expensive for its size and importance. This is why I never read novellas and extra books to series. They mostly add nothing to the story. ANYWAY, till the next book in the A Court of Thorns and Roses series, which will be late af, K BYE!",3
597,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","This is a great catch with the main heroes of the series. The last book was an all-out epic. This one, though a lot shorter, is still filed with SJM’s great storytelling and character development.So far, I have seen all these characters in the worst possible situations and facing incredible odds. Making great sacrifices and the legendary lengths they would go through to achieve their goals and protect those they love. Now, when they have “won”, the work of rebuilding, forgiveness, and moving on from the losses suffered.Yes there is no where near as much action in this book, and the characters are not moved along as much as I would have wanted but the are definitely important issues uncovered her that need to be explored later. This is more of “wet the appetite” for the next huge chapter, but almost as importantly a much need to assess where the characters are right now in themselves and to each other.Though Feyre and Rhysand embrace their fate together. Others rebel against a fate they have not chosen with their very souls. These are the first steps in building a new world. A great point to catch up with everyone as they set their path for the future, to forget their past, or simply (stubbornly) deny fates chosen path.",5
598,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","I think this is the only SJM book with an average rating under four (correct me if I'm mistaken), and I can sort of see why. This is the equivalent of a fluffy fanfic with no plot. Honestly, the plot of this series wasn't great in the first place, so ACOFAS is basically what happens when SJM makes the good decision to scrap the plot and just focus on the part I actually care about - the characters.This novella is infamous for, uh...My reviews are rated G, thank you very much.Let's just say... stuff happened in the sky.I had nearly sent us crashing into the rooftops like an Illyrian whelp.If you listen carefully, you can hear my wheezing.But that's not the main problem I had with this, even though it was, well - a littlestrange.I hate the treatment of Tamlin.I hate it so much.In case you somehow have no idea what Tamlin did in ACOMAF, here's a summary.He locked Feyre in the house and emotionally abused her. It was bad.But Rhys was such a jerk about it when it wasFeyre'sresponsibility to talk to him.Rhys just assumed that what he said was what Feyre wanted. He was needlessly cruel to someone who was suffering from PTSD.Tamlin's mental illness doesn't give him an excuse, obviously, but I'm still angry that Tamlin didn't get the help he needed. He was traumatized, scarred; but everyone focused on Feyre, leaving him to become the person he is now - broken, depressed, scared. Believing he is only worthy of hate.Look at how jerky Rhys the Beast is being literally after Tamlin saved his life:No, Tamlin deserved what he'd brought upon himself, this husk of a life. He deserved every empty room, every snarl of thorns, every meal he had to hunt for himself.That makes me sad. That actually makes me physically upset. No one deserves that. No one. And it's not even Rhys's place to say this stuff to Tamlin:""You deserve everything that has befallen you. You deserve this pathetic, empty house, your ravaged lands. I don't care if you offered that kernel of life to save me, I don't care if you still love my mate. I don't care that you saved her from Hybern, or a thousand enemies before that.I hope you live the rest of your miserable life alone here.""WHOA.CALM DOWN.Look at how depressed poor Tammy is:Tamlin didn't have shields around the house. None to prevent anyone from winnowing in, to guard against enemies appearing in his bedroom and slitting his throat.It was almost as if he was waiting for someone to do it.Let's be clear - I don't like Tamlin. He's a manipulative jerk. But he needs help. He clearly needs someone to take care of him like Rhys did for Feyre in ACOMAF. And he was not given that, so everyone hates him because of it.This also ruined Lucien's life. Now he's not welcome anywhere. And he says it like it is:""You can be as much of an asshole as that mate of yours, you know that?""I mean, he's not wrong.My other big complaint with this novella is the random ""feminist"" stuff that's thrown in so awkwardly? We get it, males can cook and clean. It's not that revolutionary. It should have been incorporated better into the story, rather than stated outright....cooking, cleaning, child-rearing, clothes-making... There was honor in such tasks - pride and good work to be found in them. But not when every single one of the females here was expected to do it... Traditions going back thousands of years, left mostly unchallenged.Until us. Until now.Rhysand is such a Feminist King™I appreciate what this is trying to do, but it's so cheesy that... I really can't, I'm sorry.""The boys can help decorate, clean, and cook. They've got two hands.""Wow, Cassian's a Feminist King™ too.Added to the random tragic backstories that strangers confessed to Feyre at the oddest times, this novella felt rather weak.Oh, yes, they wererandomall right.""My husband didn't return from the war.""Miss Girl, Feyre does not know you.Oh, and here was an absolutely stunning analogy that just... shook me to the core.This same random weaver person had a tapestry and she explained that the black thread was called the Void and that the white thread was called Hope. And then...""If I were to stop, if I were to let this loom or the spindle go silent... Then there would be no Hope shining in the Void.""Wow, so the Hope thread symbolizes hope and the Void thread symbolizes emptiness!!!Speaking of on-the-nose, Feyre has a weird relationship with money. As she reminds us, over and over and over again:The sums we allocated were sizable, more money than I'd ever dreamed of possessing.This would be okay if it were only said once. But no.It didn't feel real, those numbers and figures. Like it was children's play money. I only bought what I needed.She says this so. many. times. Basically every time she buys something.Decadent - it felt decadent, and selfish, to shop.I didn't like how the side characters developed (besides Nesta, her trauma was just haunting). No one forgives Nesta for making Feyre hunt before Prythian, and yet everyone forgives Elain when she did the same thing. It doesn't make sense. There's no explanation.""You still can barely talk to Nesta,"" I said. ""Yet Elain you can talk to nicely.""""Elain is Elain.""""If you blame one, you have to blame the other.""""No, I don't. Elain is Elain.""What kind of explanation is that? ""Elain is Elain."" And? Are we supposed to forgiveherinstead of Nesta because she's so gentle and kind and sweet and blah blah blah? I don't think so.My theory is that Elain is not actually nice. She only speaks maybe 2-5 times during this novella, and most of the time, she's speaking coldly. Everyone is surprised, but... This is just how she is. She takes advantage of her family and friends thinking she's weak and needs protecting. But she's actually just a colder person than Nesta.Elain's voice was colder than usual.I'd never heard Elain's voice so cold.Also, what is Feyre painting? No one knows. This entire novella is about her painting and I literally still don't know what she's painting.""What sort of things do you paint?""""The things that need telling.""How very descriptive.I painted and painted and painted.I painted until my back cramped... I'd known what needed to come out of me the moment I perched on the rickety stool...But it began to emerge. Began to take form.I lowered my brush and stared at what I'd created.Me.Or how I'd been in the Ouroboros, that beast of scale and claw and darkness; rage and joy and cold. All of me. What lurked beneath my skin.But...But what is it??I painted through the grief that lingered at the weaver's story, painted for her loss. I painted all that rose within me, letting the past bleed onto the canvas, a blessed relief with each stroke of my brush.I still don't know.I hadn't any idea what to get them, other than this. The [paintings] I'd worked on recently - glimpses of their stories. None of them explained what the paintings meant, what they beheld.Imagine knowing what Feyre is painting.For on that painting I'd shown him what I had not revealed to anyone. The creature inside myself, the creature full of hate and regret and love and sacrifice, the creature that could be cruel and brave, sorrowful and joyous.I'll leave you with that mystery to figure out. If anyone knows what Feyre's painting, tell me and I will thank you profusely.1.5 stars; the word ""mate"" was used 71 times. this is not Australia, thank you",2
599,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","First, technically speaking, why was this book necessary? What was the plot?Was thereeven a plot? SJM said this novella is a bridge between Feysand’s story and the next story in this world, but what exactly did it bridge?All I got from this book is anger and a gag reflex.If you’ve seen my ratings, updates, or followed me at all on here, you know I wasobsessedwith ACOMAF. It was all I talked about for about a year, from the moment I read it.I basically hated the other two books, but I loved the second one, and got so attached to feysand.But, good god, it is justnot possiblethat the person who wrote ACOMAF is the same one who wrote ACOWAR&ACOFAS. (Yes I’m hinting at a conspiracy theory).Like, ACOWAR was bad, but I still had some attachments to Feysand, even though Rhys was kind of a douche even then.But this? This wasbad.let me just saythis book is not a fantasy book. It’s a contemporary set in a different world. no fantastic elements other than flying (and even that was only mentioned for the purpose of a sex scene) were present in this book.Feyre didn’t use her powers even once. You’d think she’d use this time to practice and perfect her abilities, but no. She might as well be human.Butwhat annoyed me most about this book (and ACOWAR too tbh) is the complete regression of the characters.Feyre went back to roaming around the house doing nothing all day, Mor isstillhiding herself for no apparent reason— homophobia is not even a thing in this world and even if it were we all know the Inner Circle would accept her no matter what, so what’s the point?, Nesta went back to her old self (though I kind of get that), Amren lost all her strength and fierceness and just sits around doing jigsaw puzzles, and Rhys, oh god, Rhys. HOW IN THE WORLD is this sleazy, sex crazed douchebag supposed to be the same loving, caring, supportive Rhysand from ACOMAF? He couldn’t gotwo sentenceswithout making some unnecessary innuendos, talking about how good Feyre feels, how he can’t stand being around her without fucking her or how he dicked her in the sky while flying (???).His entire first chapter in this was him sulking and whining because he doesn’t get to fuck Feyre daily.*insert the world’s smallest violin*But putting that aside, let’s talk about how “”feminist”” he is.(I just wanna note that I know I still loved Rhys (less, but still loved him) after ACOWAR even though all those issues were present there too. It was just a little more subtle and I was still on that Feysand rush since I’d read ACOMAF only a month before. Now enough time has passed and ACOFAS has really solidified Rhys’ problematic behavior in my mind and I can see it for what it truly is.)In ACOMAF, he said [about Feyre]”My equal in every way; she would wear my crown, sit on a throne beside mine.Never sidelined, never designated to breeding and parties and child-rearing.My queen.”(page 621).And what do you know, in ACOFAS she isconstantlysidelined,andtrying for a child.In fact, the beginning of this bookreallyparallels the beginning of ACOMAF. I mean, yeah, Feyre’s in a better mental state for sure, but she still sits around the house being bored, or painting, or designing a house, while Rhysand is out there dealing with all the politics. Direct quotes from the book-”perhaps I’d use the day to organize things. Find room for everything.““High Lady of the Night Court, Defender of the Rainbow and the … Desk.”[Rhys walks in while Feyre’s in bed] “Right where I left you”... “Isn’t it all I’m good for?”Like, are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, you crowned her High Lady, but the reality is that you never involve her in anything big. You just have her clean and do some paperwork. She’s a housewife. That’ssoooofeminist of you! High Lord of the Feminist Court!Basically,Sarah J Maas made Rhys such a supporter of women in ACOMAF to make the difference between Tamlin and him even clearer, and once we all switched to Rhys’ side she figured she could just drop the act.Well, I got some news for you Sarah. It doesn’t work that way. Your readers aren’t dumb.And also, can we talk about the whole period thing? It was really cool to see such an open discussion about it in a book (no sarcasm this time) but... the idea that it makes women completely incompetent? Not so much. And that cheesy scene of him stroking her hair while she’s in pain? I almost puked.Oh and for god’s sake don’t get me started on the sisters!!!First of all- Leave! Nesta! Alone!She’s been traumatized, and she doesn’t wanna be around the Inner Circle because it’s a constant reminder of what she’d gone through. Feyre of all people should know what that feels like. But no, she keeps pressuring her and practically blackmailing her so she would come.And Cassian chasing her down her street even though she asked him to leave her alone multiple times.These people can’t respect a woman’s simple request for privacy. but hey, they have a High Lady! Yay Feminism!And I am just disgusted by how Elain is treated in this book.She is constantly pressured by Feyre to give Lucien a chance even though she repeatedly and explicitly says she’s not interested. But Feyre doesn’t let up because he’s a “good male”.Again, Feyre is such a feminist Icon!Not to mention how much Elain is belittled and ridiculed in this. She may be naive, but she’s not dumb! she’s not a child! They all (excluding Azriel, the only pure soul in this mess) keep treating and speaking to her like she’s a four year old!!!I have more thoughts but I’m so angry that I can’t even make them into a coherent sentence and this is getting too long anyway, so the bottom line is, I only care about Azriel now, but even if there’s a book about him, count me out because I’m done. I’m just done with Sarah J. Maas books.",1

601,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","3.5 StarsSo...I'm not in a reviewing mood at ALL; but I figured I better lay something down here before I completely forget any thoughts I have about this book and my experience reading it.I had a hard time rating this.Because, well, it just didn't blow my mind.That said.While I didn't love it...While I didn't really, really, reallylikeit per se...I didappreciateit.And here's why.Prior to receiving my copy in the mail and, obviously, reading the book, I received Maas' subscriber newsletter email. In it she had the usual ""woo hoo, it's release day"" fodder they all send out, but it also contained - what I would later discover upon finishing the book - was exactly what was depicted in the ""Acknowledgements"" section.In it, she talked about the process of writing this book and how hard it was because, in the midst of it, her father had a major health scare and almost died. Still, despite this trying time - she also found out she was pregnant - and, despite not really always ""feelin' it,"" Maas trudged through the writing process because DEADLINE.As someone who loves to write and also lost a parent in the past, I just really empathized with the creative struggle Maas probably had here.Now, am I saying that an author's personal life issues should be taken into account when rating/reviewing or considering your own enjoyment of a book?Hell no.Of course not.Absolutely not.I'm just saying that, FOR ME, reading about that just changed the mindset I started the book with.I went in knowing that, by her own admission, Maas struggled writing it.So I guess you could say that 1) lowered my expectations bar, and 2) made me read the book knowing Maas had been experiencing personal pain while writing it.And I think that emotion was definitely captured in the story.This book will NOT blow your mind.It does NOT really move the plot forward.But what it did do, in my opinion, was move the CHARACTERS forward.It really drilled down into a lot of their inner thoughts and longstanding issues and baggage and - as someone who loves character driven stories - I really enjoyed that aspect of the book.Also, I mentioned this in a status update while reading, but for some reason, I am REALLY intrigued by Nesta's character.She was totally selfish in book one and has continued to be heinously bitchy throughout the series, but there is just something about her strength, stubbornness, and just plain fucking resolve that I love. For whatever reason, I am just sometimes drawn to complex, fucked up, misunderstood female characters that everyone else hates. And I can't WAIT for the next book.In fact, I think the character development done in this book is going to act as a veritable buttress to the next books in the series and make them even better for its existence, as meh as it might have been plot/action-wise.So yeah, I guess I had more to say than I thought. LOL Oh well.Toodles!P.S. I thought I'd share the cool exclusive edition ends papers for anyone who hasn't seen them...",3
602,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","edit 2/21: still a waste of time but felt like i needed a refresh before ACOSF... prolly didn’t need to bother but it wasn’t that awful-------------------------------------and to think, i was so excited for this onednf @ like page 50. this just wasn't good & when i saw the second novella was announced my eyes rolled back in my head so far i saw fucking stars. i'll give you some unneeded backstory since i don't have much to say about content:i started this series before i started reviewing on goodreads. i devoured the first 2 books back to back in college and was pretty in love. at the time, i hadn't been reading hardly anything because college but after reading the first 2 i got back into reading and back into fantasy. so i will always be grateful for that, but i also think that colored my judgment of the series.when you've never had chocolate before, a hersheys bar tastes pretty fcking good. and when you haven't read fantasy in a while, SJM books seem pretty goodthese books really aren't that bad but they aren't really that good either. and SJM's bloated continuation of series is kind of getting on my last nerve. no one wanted 2 novellas. no one really wanted this series to continue beyond the first 3 books. sure we love the gang but could you just start a new series? your pregnancy shouldn't be an excuse for a shitty novella.i'm rambling. whatever. i'm selling this book.",3
603,"A Court of Frost and Starlight (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #3.5)","Real Rating: 2.5This book made me realize that I am more interested in the characters that are not in the inner circle like Lucien, Tamlin, Viviane, Kallias and even Eris (I’m really intrigued by him). Anytime those people were mentioned, my interest in the book rose. Unfortunately, since they are indeed not part of the inner circle, their presence in this was either non-existent or minuscule.This book was said to bridge the gap between what happened in previous books and the next ones. I somewhat agree that there is a sense of direction as to what the next book is going to be about but most of what happened in this had no bearing on that. Honestly, I believe this novella wasn’t necessary and SJM should have written a full book. This book had so many unnecessary fillers.What to expect- Feyre shopping- Feyre and Rhysand having dirty thoughts about themselves all the time/doing dirty things to themselves. The sex scenes/thoughts in this series used to give me anxiety because I did not want to read about that but in this, it was just annoying and old- Feyre painting- Feyre being sad that she was rich- Rhysand being ‘perfect’- To mix things up: Illyrian drama, Tamlin being sad, Nesta being annoying.Things I liked- My kind, loyal Lucien: I loved reading about him (mostly from other people talking about him) and I loved his brief appearance.- I liked reading about Tamlin even though it was mostly depressing. I have a feeling his situation is going to change soon.- I think among the inner circle, Azriel is my favourite and I loved reading about him. I’m curious about his shadows.- I like Eris… I don’t know why, I tried not to but I can’t help it. I think there is more to him than meets the eye.- I liked Feyre when she was not with/thinking about Rhysand. She’s actually a really nice and caring person.Now to get to some details- I know ACOTAR was beauty and the beast retelling but Tamlin in this gave me 'pre-belle' beast vibe with how lonely and depressing him and his court is. So hopefully, his belle would come soon 💕- I honestly don’t think Feyre did that much damage in the spring court to warrant the current state- I used the ship Nesta with Cassian like most people do but while reading this, I realized that I only shipped them because of the tension they have together. I used to like Nesta because I found her intriguing but she was so annoying in this and I honestly don’t know why Cassian still likes her. He deserves better and I honestly started shipping him with that girl at the shop smh- I also used to Ship Elain with Lucien but she’s so rude to him. No one is saying you have to be with him but at least be nice. He also deserves better- I don’t ship Azriel with Elain because their relationship gives me family vibe and not romantic. Especially with the comment about his mother- I still can’t believe Mor hasn’t told Azriel the truth..Until she does that, I don’t think I can like her.- I’m tired of being sad for Lucien. I really hope in the next books, we see him being happyOverall, if you’re a Feysand fan, you’ll probably really like this but I’m not so it was eh.This book wasn't worth my excitement and not just because Lucien was there for like 2 pagesP.Sare we ever going to know how rhysand became the most powerful high lord in history? or at least how that was provenPre-readingThis comes in exactly 2 weeks. I get to read about Lucien in 2 weeks (HOPEFULLY) 😭😭😭😭💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",3

607,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","Be warned, if you love this book,do not read this review.I am not showing it any mercy.To say I hadmassiveexpectations is an understatement. I jumped into this knowing I was getting into a romcom. I was waiting forpeople we meet on vacationfeels orWall of Winnipegswoons and I got abig pile of the most obnoxious, insufferable writingand plot devices I've seen in a looooong time.This author managed to write the same book twice...inside of the same book.Does that make sense? Let's start with the fact that this wasnearly 700 pages longand every time the main characterPOUTEDbecause she needed caffeine, I wanted to live a little less.I need to be fair... Some of the sex scenes were sweet, and this couple could have been cute. This book just had to beAT LEAST 300 pages shorterand the characters had to have a personality and the maturity of a normal human being and not sound like they were all 12. I don't think that is too much to ask, honestly.This book managed to include every single thing I hate in romcoms, every-single-thing.Leaving the EXTREMELY obnoxious, forced and stereotypical gay representation in this aside...Let's start with the fact that some authors just go overboard with their ""sunshine"" characters. Why does every sunshine woman need to be co-dependent? Why can't you write a NORMAL bubbly woman, who knows how to be a functional adult?Nooooooo, but that's not stereotypical enough. A sunshine character is quirky!!! She loves coffee! She can't remember where she parked her car! She is so entertaining!! Did I mention sheLOOOOOOOOOOVEScoffee? Oh I didn't? Don't worry, the author will make her groan and pout 22 times while she's thinking about coffee before chapter 10, and that is just soooooooooo sexy.We need to be done with the idea that bubbly women are stupid and helpless women. I can't relate to female characters like that.Have you ever met a woman?In what world would a woman not know what to do in a crisis situation?!She cries to a complete stranger and asks him:please, help me, what should I do?5 times in the first two chapters. The fact that a 40 year old man finds a broken shell of a woman attractive is a red flag of its own.There are so many things that annoyed the fuck out of me in this book, none of this plot made sense. None of this was down-to-earth, realistic, everything felt forced, all the jokes and the stereotyping were taken to a MAXIMUM.Oh Julia, but it's fiction. Give it a rest. I have a list of romantic comedies with sunshine and grumpy characters that were written like a damn masterpiece. This one is just bad, I am sorry.How do you expect me to find their childish bickering from chapter 1 attractive and sexy?The most mature character in this entire book was an 11 year old.Honorable mentions to:""I knew you'd have a ""fuck me body""sentence that came out of our hero's mouth at some point during their first time.She filled 700 pages with the same back and forth, multiple times, and I think 300 of those pages were inner dialogues of Knox being the most pathetic 40 year old I have ever met and our female lead thinking about coffee, orgasms or having chats with her gay best friend who knows everythinggggg about hair!!Spare me.This could have been anok, sweet story if she just had dialed it down a notch, had not repeated herself 300 times and written normal, down-to-earth characters.I am honestly annoyed at the misrepresentation of gay characters. I am sick of bubbly women being portrayed as stupid and helpless, I am sick of men's lack of emotional responsibility and maturity being down-played, forgiven easily and used as a plot device. (And I am a dark romance reader so that’s saying something)This was a bad, boring, over-the-top stupid, over-hyped book.Sorry, that is my brutally honest review.It's ok if you liked this book. On a good day I can kind of see why, I feel bad for it, honestly. It just compiledevery single thing I hate in romcomsand threw it at me and I am pissed at it lol, so yeah, two PITY stars.I did also hateit happened one summer, another popular and loved book that people compare to this one a lot. Keep that in mind and take it with a grain a salt, this book might be for you! It’s just definitely not for me!",2

609,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","I GENUINELY CANNOT EXPRESS HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS BOOK?!?!?!!?Nearly two weeks after reading the book am I now writing the review and it’s safe to say I haven’t stopped thinking about it. I’M NOT EVEN KIDDING. I’m itching to pick up the book and flip through my tabbed pages and there’s A LOTTTTT. My guess would be over 150 tabs?!? Idk, give or take 🤷‍♀️This book came at a time where I was waiting for the next book to WOWWWW me, and mannnnn, did this not disappoint. I was hooked from the START!!!It’s always a struggle for me to start a book because there’s always that lull at the beginning when you’re getting to know the characters before you get invested, but I was into this from the START. And that’s how I usually know I’ll love the book, is when I’m invested by the end of the first chapter or the first few.IT IS SO FUCKING GOOD!! It’s grumpy sunshine, small romance, she finds out she has a niece she never knew while she has to waltz in and clean up her twin sister’s mess. FROM THE BEGINNING, YOU GET TO SEE HOW GRUMPY KNOX MORGAN IS. This man is soooooooo fucking hot oh my god, I can’t even write this sentence without feeling giddy and wanting to squeal!!I’m so in love with him, I fell in love with every single one of the characters, LITERALLY EVERY ONE (except a big fuck you to Tina), and the story just grips you from beginning to end.There is one particular character I instantly knew I needed a book from and that’s my baby Lucian!! The small snippets you see of him in this book is going to make you fall and fall hard. I hadn’t even finished the book at the time when I decided that he was gonna be my next obsession. (Ofc he’s gonna come second to Mr. Bearded Badboy Grumpy Knox Morgan because that man is everythiiiing)^ here’s how I picture Knox… you know that guy on TikTok with the axe who breaks apart those tree trunks??? THAT MAN???? In my head, that’s him 🤪 (If you don’t like fan casting, then just forget I said anything ��)I thought I was deluding myself when I finished this book?! I thought to myself, “did I really love this??? Or was this just the first book I got excited for in what feels like a while??”NOPEEEEE. Two things can be true. It was the first book that left me feeling so excited AND I really loved it.There is a happily ever after, and not only do we get one epilogue, BUT ALSO A BONUS EPILOGUE. Seriously, in that bonus epilogue?!?!? With Way and Knox and the way they spoke to each other?! OH MY GOD MY HEART EXPLODED!!When I finish a book, I’m usually at a loss for how to review it especially when it’s been a while since I finished it, but I think this is one of my fastest written reviews lmaooooo. I just really loved this book and highly highly recommend it.It’s a pretty long book, about 500-600 pages (can’t remember) but it didn’t read that long to me at all. I got through it so quickly. I couldn’t put it down.There are just so many good parts in this book that I genuinely head-over-heels enjoyed. How grumpy this man is, the support he gives Naomi, the love and encouragement and pep talks he gave Way. UGH!!! ❤️‍🔥 I wanna read it again byeeee",5

616,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","This is a story about a nice woman who gets into an abusive relationship, and the author calls it romance.I've read a lot of rom-coms, and this book is neither rom nor com. I don't understand how a man who ignores your wishes and opinions, belittles you, dismisses you, takes away your agency, physically grabs you and drags you around, intervenes in your business when he's not wanted, is controlling, is financially and emotionally abusive, snarls, growls, and uses his physicality to intimidate you is in ANY way a romantic lead. The number of strong reviews for this book and positive views of the main male character is truly disturbing. I mean, he even renames her! Her name isn't even good enough.I fully expected Naomi to be buried in a ditch by the end of the book. But I couldn't stand it, so DNF.",1
617,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","i surprisingly liked this a lot more than i thought i would!i mean, dont get me wrong. there are some flaws. the writing is basic, the characters dont act their age (which is in their 30-40s!) and the book is longer than it needs to be, but i was wholly invested in the story regardless.and its probably im a sucker for tropes. i enjoyed the sunshine x grumpy character dynamics, the small town setting was perfect for gossip and forced proximity, and the sudden/new parenthood also surprisingly worked for me (probably because way was an awesome kid)!overall, this is exactly the kind of entertainment i wanted.↠4 stars",4

With an avg. rating of 4.72 it seems like I’m going to be the odd one again who can’t rate this more than 2.5 stars maxMe right after finishing Things We Never Got Over:🤡 I think I’m going to rate this 3.5 stars and round it up to 4 stars 🤡, cause the book was cute after all and had a tons of tropes done well such as☀️ sunshine runaway bride & grumpy bad boy barber/business owner🐶 a cute dog👵 a cool grandma👩‍👧 a newly single - mum who had guardianship of her 11 year old niece temporary, cause her twin sister stole her car, left town and left her daughter with her🧠 smart & funny kid🏡 small town vibes a.k.a tons of gossip & meddling folks🏠 forced proximity (mcs are neighbors)🍹 boss / employee💑 very supportive and loving parents from the heroine’s side💖 heroine has the best gay best friend (1. why are the male best friends in romance always gay if they are not the love interest? 2. he is in the mafia or what are those mysterious business calls he always has to take??? 3. where is Stef’s book??!)🔥 Hero hasgreathot friends too and a hot younger brother who is a cop (Lucian-sir spare me a hand in marriage?? Nash-daddy handcuff me to your bed???)all of this combined feels like a lovechild between Mariana Zapata and Kristen Ashley and makes for a great comfort book = happy Phuong.Me writing this review:Sooo this book is aboutDaisy(h) andKnox(H).*looks at the cover*well okay, Daisy just left her fiancée at the altar ...*accidentally clicks on the blurb*“Naomi wasn’t just running away from her wedding.” WHO THE FUCK IS NAOMI?*opens the book in panic to check the heroine’s chapter heading*“Chapter 1 Naomi” Oh... OHHH.. okay THAT’S her name, Knox calling her Daisy all the time was only an endearment I see, and it was because Dai-Naomi had flowers in her hair when he met her..oh now I get it.The fact that I only realized now that I had the heroine’s name wrong this whole time, it’s embarrassing ahahahaha. Just for that alone, I’m sorry I can’t give this book 4 stars with good conscious, even tho I had mostly a good time reading it, but if I can’t even recall the first name of the main character, I don’t know what else my fragile mind blocked out. 🕳️🏃🏻‍♀️“Why are you whispering?”“Because he lives right there,” I said, pointing my glass in the direction of Knox’s cabin.“Oooh. Grumpy next-door neighbor. That’s one of my favorite tropes.”“The first time he met me, he called me trash.”“That bitch.”“Well, technically he thought I was Tina [the twin sister] when he was yelling at me in front of an entire cafe full of strangers.”“That vision-impaired bitch.”“God, I love you.” I sighed.Don’t mind me inserting this random quote, I just love Stef. He is my spirit animal.Conclusion:Very cute book and I don’t have much to complain about beside that the first 20% didn’t rlly catch me as much as I hoped it would, but then the people of Knockemount grew on me. The heroine was too much of a goody two shoe for me sometimes, but not too bad that it would annoy me. Things We Never Got Over is not a story that will stay forever with me ahem🤡, but I honestly have a lot of good things to say about it, first and foremost all the side characters that carried this book like champs! Can’t wait to read Lucian and Sloane’s book!P.S. Not Lucy Score referencing her own book Rock Bottom Girl when Naomi needed to research about soccer 😭🤚I don't know if I find it endearing or lowkey embarrassing..the jury's still out, but most of all I wish I had that self-confidence lmao.",3

This book has a big cast but Lucy Score did such a great job of making every character unique so I fell in love with each and every one of them. Plus freaking Knox Morgan is *chef's kiss* incredible. I really appreciated how he's got his own demons that weren't instantly solved but took time for him to really change. Plus Naomi and her relationship with Waylay made my heart melt. Please read this book,5
623,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","“Naomi, this isn’t what I wanted.”Just like the above sentence from this book, this isn't what readers like me too wanted. This was a strange book where the characters behaved in bizarre ways. The main characters, Naomi and Knox, are both above 35 years. Yet, they areacting like irritating kindergarten kidswho are obsessed with actions similar to Disney characters in some parts of the book and liketoxic, emotionally manipulating, and stalking characters in the other parts.Character developmentis one of the most important aspects of a novel; the characters create and push the plot forward. I felt that this book's flawed character development sadly pulls the story backward.It looks like the author was totally confused about the mannerisms given to her characters. So she vacillates between polar opposite behaviors with a lot of unnecessary smut in unexpected, strange circumstances.There is a big difference between some banter and being toxic.To make things even worse this book has more than500 pages. The blurb of this book looked promising, and many of my friends gave high ratings for it. So I read it cover to cover, hoping the author would revive it at some stage. But nothing happened even after the epilogue and the bonus epilogue. At last, it turned out to be a big disappointment.",1
624,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","“Barf,” Waylay complained.You and me both, Waylay.Naomi Witt is a runaway bride who left her would-be husband at the altar and, for some reason, decided to run straight to her Very Evil twin sister in the podunk town of Knockemout (Knock 'Em Out), Virginia. Evil Twin Sister then steals Naomi's car and money leaving poor Naomi stuck in Knockemout. Evil Twin Sister has apparently managed to piss off the entirety of Knockemout, despite only living there for a year, and so everyone hates Naomi at first sight. But Naomi is beautiful and perfect and friendly and amazing, so she quickly wins everyone over, except for Grumpy Bad Boy Knox Morgan.This is a TropeTastic book–mistaken identity, enemies to lovers, forced proximity, fake dating, good girl/bad boy, and grumpy x sunshine are all of the tropes that I can think of off the top of my head. And the book suffered for it. The only reason this book needed to be almost 600 pages was so the author could squeeze in every possible romance trope that she could think of. And despite all of these great tropes–they might be cliches but they're so popular because they work–this book sucked. I'm sorry but I'm not sorry. Usually I save one star ratings for books that offend me with some form of racism or internalized misogyny or romanticizations of abusive relationships. This book teetered on the latter two issues but never fully delved into them, but I still couldn't bring myself to give this book two stars.🌼 I couldn't stand the hero or the heroine. Naomi is a perfect goody-two shoes, so beautiful that every single guy has a hard-on for her, so nice that any person who talks to her instantly wants to be her friend. Her fatal flaw is that shecares too muchand no one ever cares about her in return.Yawn.🌼 Knox is The Worst. This book tries to be a grumpy x sunshine book, but Knox isn't just grumpy. He's an angry, controlling, manipulative hypocrite with daddy issues. He constantly pushes Naomi around, literally, even though it's supposed to be romantic because he's a big, sexy man? I can't believe the author had the audacity to write a hero so physically controlling for her heroine whojust ran away from an abusive relationship.And when Knox broke things off with Naomi for literally no reason, he had the audacity to tell her, ""Can't we be fucking adults about this?"" Look in the goddamn mirror, Knox.🌼 This book just didn't know what it wanted to be. There was the main romance plotline, full of all the tropes mentioned above, but there were so many subplots. Again, this book really didn't need to be 600 pages and it desperately needed an editor.🌼 The characters were so one-dimensional and every issue/inconvenience felt extremely contrived. For instance, the ongoing subplot of Naomi trying to impress the CPS lady. In the end, it turned out to be a non-issue and only existed so the CPS lady could give Naomi advice about Knox.🌼 This book descends into Life Lesson territory so fast. I don't read books to feel lectured, and I didn't need every single character to have a drawn-out heart-to-heart with each other to grasp the main meanings behind this book. I'm starting to think that subtlety in writing is a lost art.🌼 I almost forgot that one of Knox's main character traits is that he won the lottery. And when it's first mentioned, they talk about how Knox wassmart with his moneyand didn't blow it all on random things, so he's still a millionaire today. But throughout the entire book, Knox is so stupid with money. He quite literally throws his money at people to buy their affection. He likes to use his money to try and control people and resorts to bribery to get his way. And I'm supposed to believe this is a guy who issmart and benevolent with his money?Nope.🌼 Despite everything happening in this book, the characters were so flat that I couldn't find it in myself to ever care about them. The only two characters that intrigued me were Waylay and Evil Twin Sister. By the way, Evil Twin Sister is apparently a scourge on the earth because she couldn't handle having a perfect twin sister. She's the most black-and-white villain ever. I wanted more depth to her; I like having complicated villains. But nope, that would require a subtlety and nuance that this author apparently is allergic to.🌼 I really didn't understand Knox's reasons for being so anti-relationship and I honestly didn't really care. The man is supposed to be in his mid-forties but he had the emotional maturity of a nineteen-year-old frat boy. Build a bridge and get over your issues because you're making yourself and everyone around you miserable.",1
625,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","I am writing this review with a heavy heart, because as fiercely as I loved the author’s other work, especially the Benevolence series, Bootleg Springs series, By a Thread, the Christmas Fix, the Worst Best Man, Rock Bottom Girl, etc., I felt the complete opposite after reading Things We Never Got Over. I generally do not include spoilers in my review, but am citing a few examples from the story to explain my low rating. If you don’t like spoilers, read no further.Knox Morgan our “hero” was anything but in my opinion. While I love an alpha and a growly grump with a squishy marshmallow center, I felt Knox was a condescending, self-righteous, steamrolling jerk.The story takes place in the small town of Knockemout, Virginia, where Knox lives in a cabin on the same property that he shares with his widowed grandmother. He’s 43 and won $11 million in the lottery a few years back which caused a rift between him and his only brother, Nash, the town’s chief of police, whom I adored. It wasn’t an argument over money, as Knox did offer him a generous share, it was how Knox reacted when Nash refused. Knox was arrogant and demeaning, and treated Nash horribly from beginning to end in my opinion. While not estranged, Knox obviously held resentments and needed professional help. Nash was a good man, level headed and honorable, and did not deserve it.We meet our heroine, Naomi, the day after she leaves her fiancé (for good reason) at the altar and blows into town in a whirlwind to help her evil twin sister, Tina. With a hopeful heart and generous spirit, Naomi once again falls into her trap and is blindsided by her wickedness as she stole her car and ransacked her hotel room. But her frown turned upside down when she was introduced to her adorable 11-year-old niece, Waylay, and agrees to become her guardian, even though she’s not sure how she will manage.When Knox meets Naomi at a local coffee shop, he believes she is her identical twin, causes a scene, and is anything but pleasant. I loved the sass she volleyed back to Knox and how easily she could read him and was not intimidated. Upon learning she is “not Tina” (her nickname did make me laugh), Knox offers to help her by belting out directives and taking her to an adorable cottage on his grandmother’s property. Naomi was ever so grateful and humble, and things were looking up as she was able to work out a deal with Liza J.Knox showed no respect to his brother when he officially came to investigate the break-in and car theft. The tension was so thick between the brothers that Knox egged Nash on and challenged him to a fight saying, “I saw her first.” Nash may have thrown the first punch, but after Knox punched his brother in the face, he internalized that “messing up Nash was always gratifying.” It was the first of several fistfights that Knox got into, which is a really big turn off for me.Naomi scored a job and didn’t realize it was at the local bar Knox owned. She was tired and nervous, as she never worked in the restaurant industry before, and instead of welcoming her, Knox humiliated her and demanded she “get out,” and that he “didn’t want her around.” He said, “I’m not working with some uppity, needy pain in the a$$.”This is the same woman who just had her whole life upended–and he knew this! She left her fiancé, quite her job, left her home, was missing her wallet, phone and car, taken responsibility for her niece, and was trying to start over, and he was such a crass a-hole. Even though she was a bit naive, Naomi was so sweet and had so much character. She tried her best to keep her composure, worked all night against his wishes to earn a few bucks, and then Knox had a change of heart asking her to stay. He was so hot and cold that it gave me whiplash.I feel Knox suffers from borderline personality disorder (fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, shifting self-image, impulsive, self-destructive, extreme emotional mood swings, chronic feelings of emptiness, and explosive anger.) He also possesses a narcissist’s grandiose sense of self-importance, which leads him to feel a sense of entitlement, and expects everyone to comply with his expectations without question.He was Jekyll and Hyde, gaslighting and mistreating her over and over and yet she still fell in love. Then breaks her heart and leaves...just like he said he would, and has the nerve to sulk! Out of concern Nash asked his brother as to why he broke things off, and Knox replied with, “Problem...with you helping yourself to my leftovers? Nah. Better she didn’t go to waste.”There wasn’t any romance unless you consider the time he offered to take her on a lunch date, then tossed a bagged PBJ onto her lap in his truck, convincing her to partake in an afternoon delight. Sadly, she was starry-eyed and lacked the confidence to kick him to the curb. Her life was constantly filled with drama and stress with her sister’s illegal activities, yet she remained cheerful, tried to do right by her niece planning activities to support her emotional health, all while working two jobs to become financially secure.Watching Waylay feel safe and loved for the first time in her life was really emotional. I was totally invested in their relationship and enjoyed how they got to know one another, were both hopeful for a brighter future, and dealt with Tina’s betrayal. They were victims and survivors, and I admired their strength, perseverance, and positive attitude. Naomi selflessly sold her wedding dress and used it to by her niece clothes, sold her home so she could buy a car, and agreed to clean and organize his grandmother’s house in exchange for rent. She was hardworking, resilient, and a go-getter, earning my total respect.And after Knox tossed Naomi and Waylay “like a discarded receipt he no longer needed,” she held her head high and repeatedly asked him to stop contacting her, but he didn’t respect her wishes and continued to stalk her. Then an incident happened with her sister, and he TOLD her they were getting back together. He never asked her, nor did he apologize, and to my great disappointment, she succumbed. I wish I could jump in the story and tell her that she doesn’t need Knox's scraps of affection and that she deserves better.This story does end with a HEA for the couple, and Knox did make an effort to change towards the end, but it was a little too late for me. We all have hang-ups, but it doesn’t mean we go through life as a jerk. I felt he was emotionally abusive, controlling, and passive-aggressive.Lucy Score is one of my favorite authors, and even though I did not care for the hero of this story, I will be continuing with the series and look forward to seeing who falls in love next in Knockemout. I really liked her friend Stef from home, Simone the local librarian, Nash, her parents, his grandmom, and the local townsfolk.",2
626,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","***4.5 STARS***This is my first book by Lucy Score but it will definitely not be my last.Naomi comes to the small town of Knockemout after leaving her fiancée at the alter and to come help her twin sister Tina. When she gets to town she realizes her sister had caused all kinds of hell in town and has a bad reputation. In fact she is thought to be her sister when she goes to the local cafe and Knox Morgan shows up to “escort” her out of town. The couple are thrown together and Naomi realizes that she has an eleven year old niece that she knew nothing about which ties her to the small town.Very well written. Excellent storytelling, pacing, banter and dialogue. I loved Knox. He is the grumpy gorgeous hunk that has sworn off relationships and it is fun watching him fall. The only drawback I had was the length. It was a long book. But it kept my attention.I highly recommend it.",5
627,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","2.5 starsI’m gonna bullet point this review for brevity’s sake, because at this point, the general consensus is that everyone loved this book and made it a bestseller so they must have seen something in it that I didn’t.If you loved the book, don’t read this, because I honestly I hated it.• too long for what it actually contained.(spoiler alert, it was mostly sexy scenes which added nothing to the plot)If I read a 600 pages book I’m expecting it to tie all the issues nicely by the end of the book. To provide answers to all the questions andmost importantlyto show me true character growth. This book -did not.• I keep hearing this described as a grumpy/sunshine pairing when it comes to the hero and heroine and unless I forgot what that means I’m pretty sure(actually, I would bet my life on it)that the hero Knox, was not grumpy, he was an absolute a$$hole, nothing less, nothing more. When someone acts rude, and downright verbally abusive to someone else for no reason whatsoever and keeps going back and forth with this attitude- again - for no reason whatsoever, that’s not a grumpy person - to me grumpy is maybe someone a little surly, a little rude, a little, blunt and a little impatient when it comes to general human interaction - and their attitude is not restricted to any one person in particular but rather everyone they encounter. The hero in this book had no reason to behave the way he did and I was just put off by him for most of the book. Also considering his age(I don’t like to say that someone should act a certain way according to their age - because God knows I’m the poster child for do Not act your age, but for a 40 something man to be so…. immature and irrational, it majorly put me off, no, thank you)•The heroine, I liked her, but I would have loved to see her more settled into her own and knowing exactly who she is and what she wants by the end of the book. She does make some decisions but I still feel like she lets the events that happened to her and the people in her life derail most of her individual and personal decisions.• the last point I’m gonna make but not necessarily the last thing that troubled me in this book, is that the heroine’s niece wasn’t given the proper story act that she needed. That was a child that was abandoned and she definitely had issues because of it - it’s just not possible otherwise and yet it felt like that whole situation was just used to give us an intro into the story but it wasn’t explored with the respect and dedication it needed to be. I actually would have loved to see that part play out, and I thought it was going to after reading the synopsis- but instead this veered into completely different grounds.So why did I give it 3 stars? Because I think it’s well written and it could be an overall a good time for most people, objectively, this wasn’t an awful book, it definitely wasn’t what I would consider a good story but the elements were there.In conclusion, I didn’t buy into the hype of this book. Do I get it? Yes, it does have a small town vibe, a hero who acts like an a$$ and a heroine who is trying her best and is a genuinely nice person. But is this worth the praises I’ve heard? Absolutely not. There are loads of books with this trope which have done it better and in less pages but are unfortunately not as popular.",3

629,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","2,5/5Ta książka byłaby dużo lepsza bez perspektywy Knoxa, albo przynajmniej bez jego mizogińskich wtrąceń.Mam też ogromny zarzut do stylu autorki/tłumaczenia. ""To co zostaje w nas na zawsze"" jest napisane jakby autorką była piętnastolatka. Ludzie nie rozmawiają w ten sposób i nie zachowują się tak jak bohaterowie powieści.",2
630,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","I saw a video saying this book was copaganda and suddenly everything makes more sense 💀Okay, so I really need to stop taking book recs from certain people.I don't even really want to talk about this book a lot, so I'm just going to list what I didn't like:-How the days worked? She would wake up, have a giant ass cup of coffee, do one activity, be exhausted, go to sleep, and then it was the next day, BUT she would pick up the kid from the bus from the day before. I don't know if that made sense, but that's the thing, IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. So basically, my explanation is perfect.-Coffee was this girl's ENTIRE personality for most of the book. I don't mind characters having an obsession with a food or drink, but when it's ALL they talk about, think about, or go get, it's ANNOYING.-This eleven-year-old was acting like a seventeen-year-old which I understand to a certain point since she kinda raised herself and was on her own, BUT the way she talked is what annoyed me the most. Kids can be more mature, but it should still show that they are a child through their speech mannerisms.-I didn't really like Knox. I don't really have anything to say about him. He didn't stand out, was bland, was an idiot (LIKE FRL), and pissed me off.-The ""climax"" with the sister and her boyfriend was so unrealistic I was dying laughing. And not in a good way 💀-The pacing was not for me. It was very insta-lovey just without them admitting it. I didn't feel the tension the characters were apparently experiencing and that really just turns me off the book. IF I DON'T FEEL THE TENSION, I DON'T WANT IT :)-Finally, the repetition. Oh my god, the amount of times I read that this girl always took care of others and didn't take the time to see what she wanted or needed, was the most infuriating thing EVER.Honestly, I should have DNFed because even the scenes I was looking forward to in the book (the ones promoting it on TikTok, you guys know what I mean) were a letdown.2.5 stars for some of the spice scenes and the two scenes that made me smile.",2

Andbad-boy- wtf.2. he""prefers to live his life the way he takes his coffee: Alone.""- already mentioning the coffee3.""a rough-around-the-edges town where disputes are settled the old-fashioned way…with fists and beer.

Her mean older sister?Did I seriously pick up this book, read the blurb and think ""yup, this book will be an amazingly intriguing read""?

The guy has no contacts on and thinks that this girl is the sister (oh no!) and who is a big meanie.5. She is immediately attracted to him and calls him a ""viking"".6. She says something to him and gets the coffee.7. She asks if she can marry the guy who made her the coffee.8. She points a finger at him and touches hard muscle9.

He saves her from living in a motel and she adopts her niece on the way (yay!)Bored yet? Yeah so was I.There was also no need for a thousand different subplots that led the actual plot to nowhere, nor the excessive amount of characters that I can't even begin to remember (I read this back in August and it still haunts me to this day).Knox:“I liked my women the way I liked my relationships—fast, dirty, and casual.”I feel like I need a restraining order, he was such a misogynistic ass. His ego somehow manages to be bigger than his""magical wand that casts orgasm spells"".

633,"Things We Never Got Over (Knockemout, #1)","5 stars“You get to decide how you show up in this world. No one else gets to dictate to you who you are,”I’ve read several Lucy Score books but this is by far the best I’ve read yet! I had such a good time reading this story. It was the perfect mix of fun, sweet, emotional, and just a bit suspenseful.Naomi and Knox have an interesting meet cute. When Naomi rolls into town with daisies in her hair she doesn’t expect the welcome she gets. See, her twin sister who is basically a menace to the town, asks for her help. When Naomi shows, she is, of course, mistaken for the twin. That lasts for a bit but ultimately she carves her own place out in town, along with her niece who she’s taking care of.Naomi was fantastic and warmed up to everyone fast, aside from Knox. I loved their banter and even when they were back and forth you could tell they both had it bad for one another. I loved seeing them fall for one another. Knox was fantastic as well.This was one of those books I didn’t want to stop listening to. It was 16 hours long and I listened to it in a day and a half! If you’re a fan of Kristen Ashley’s older books (think the CM series) this book gave off those same vibes. The story was different, but it gave me the same kind of feelings, as well as having epic secondary characters.

638,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","In a Nutshell:The good news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ The bad news is that this is just like ‘The Housemaid.’ A fun thriller, as long as you don’t overanalyse it. Better if you read the series in order.Story Synopsis:Millie is back, still working as a maid, and still struggling for finances. She is in a steady relationship with Brock, a lawyer who doesn’t know anything about her past. Not that she loves Brock, but as Enzo isn’t around, he will do.After Millie loses her current job, she gets a call from Douglas Garrick, a wealthy tech specialist. He wants Millie to clean and cook, but on one condition|: she is NOT to interact with his wife Wendy, who is ill. As Millie is desperate for a job, she agrees. However, things are, but obviously, not as declared, and Millie finds herself in a quandary; risk her job by helping Wendy, or go against her values by ignoring what’s happening?The book comes to us in the first person perspective of two of the characters, one being Millie.This sequel doesn't exactly continue from the end of the first novel, but provides enough of context to help us bridge to the events of this book. Though this can work as a standalone, I recommend you read the series in order, because Millie’s personality is much better explored in the first book.Since I complain about Bookouture blurbs quite often (Sorry, Bookouture! I still love you though!), I think I should also give them credit when they nail the task. The blurb of this book is spot on, revealing just as much as needed and creating enough interest without spoiling the fun or misleading. Good job!On the pro side, the story has every positive element that was present in the earlier book:👉 Quick-paced writing.👉 A storyline that keeps you invested even when you know what’s to come (or so you think.)👉 An intriguing prologue.👉 Characters who say one thing and do something else.👉 Twists – some foreseeable, some out of the blue.👉 Some funny moments, courtesy Millie’s snide remarks in her first person pov.👉 An ending that works well for the story.On the flip side,⚠ The pattern of the book is exactly the same as the first book. (And many other thrillers.) So the minute the prologue began, I knew it was not narrated by whom we would assume it to be. The appearance of the second character’s pov created a huge déjà vu moment, as I knew it would contradict everything Millie had told us so far. I was still interested in the proceedings; it is just that instead of enjoying the story as a fresh tale, I found myself playing detective and figuring out the twists based on the similarity to the first book.⚠ Millie didn’t endear herself to me this time around. Her attitude towards Brock was quite irksome, and her thoughts very repetitive. While she shows her true spirit by the end, I wish it had been more evident throughout.⚠ The writing is also somewhat basic, though, to be honest, I don’t read a thriller for its prose. But the overdose of foreshadowing and the back-and-forth rambling by Millie were somewhat disappointing.All in all, this is still gripping enough to provide an entertaining ride. I liked the first book much better as it had plenty of dark undertones. This one offers standard fare in comparison.I finally have the chance to use a phrase so many of my reviewer-friends do: it’s a popcorn thriller! Treat it as such than as a literary classic. As long as you read it with your logical side kept aside, you can have fun with it.3.5 stars, rounding up as it allowed me to complete it within a day.My thanks to Bookouture and NetGalley for the DRC of “The Housemaid's Secret”.

A little backstory, “The Housemaid” was the first novel I read by her and I was instantly hooked. She is an exceptional author as I’ve read some of her other books as well but I was anxiously waiting for the sequel to “The Housemaid” because it was one of the best novels I read in 2022.Now, before I jump into my review, I want to let you all know about two trigger warnings in case they could affect you while reading. McFadden does a phenomenal job not describing anything in any kind of detail which is great but there are insinuations of violence against women and self-harm. Again, nothing is too detailed or graphic, just insinuated so I wanted to give everyone a heads-up about that. McFadden gets major props from me for not going into any specifics in both potential trigger warnings.I was very happy to get right back into what is going on with the main protagonist Millie since the ending to “The Housemaid” was pretty wild. Millie is awesome and I truly loved all the New York vibes in this novel. Being born and raised in Queens, NY, I loved all the references, especially to the NY Mets. It just felt so authentic and added another layer of immersion to this novel for me being a New Yorker and all.Besides that, all the little references to the first book in this series were also brilliantly done. I’d recommend reading the first one and then jumping right into this one to see what I mean. McFadden is a great storyteller that delivers some incredible suspense, mystery, tension, and my goodness, her plot twists are on a whole other level. She’s fantastic when it comes to them and they will literally have your jaw on the floor with how crazy they are once revealed. That’s exactly what happened to me and I still can’t believe them.This sequel delivers in ways only McFadden can conjure as it’s another incredible psychological thriller of a read. I love how all of her books are so fast-paced and addictive, you simply can’t put them down even if you tried. Her writing is so seamless that this novel was a genuine page-turner, especially when you get to the second half towards a crazy ending I never saw coming. Seriously, I���m still completely blown away by the ending.I give “The Housemaid's Secret” by Freida McFadden a perfect 5/5 as it’s another amazing novel by her that I’d highly recommend to anyone that wants a wild psychological thriller with crazy plot twists, mystery, and an incredible reading experience. McFadden is truly making a name for herself and I look forward to reading every single thing she’s written and all her future novels. She’s that magnificent and is an author I look forward to reading for many years to come.",5
642,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","3.0 stars. After loving everything but the ending of “The Housemaid”I dove right into the sequel “The Housemaid’s Secret.” Although I always enjoy Ms. McFadden’s fast paced writing style, I didn’t enjoy “Secret” near as much as its predecessor. The primary distinction between the two books, in my opinion, was the tone of the book. “Secret” seemed to be written in a tounge-in-cheek style that began to grate on my nerves the more I read. For instance, at the very beginning of the book Millie gets fired from her job because the baby she was the caretaker for called her mommy in front of the baby’s real mother. It was written so over the top I couldn’t believe the author wanted me to believe this was a real scene in the book. Many other scenes (even ones depicting violent acts) were written so unrealistically, I never became invested in any of the characters. Because of the tone I would rate the book as just average even if I was able to fly through it. At times it felt like I was reading an early rough draft of the novel as the scenes were described in a bare bones style that were over before they could build any suspense. I never felt this way about “The Housemaid.” As you could probably tell from my very disjointed review, I had the hardest time explaining what I didn’t like about the book. The whimsical writing style on what could have been a great sequel to a great book left me unimpressed. I will definitely read Ms. McFadden again because admittedly her books are never boring and I’ve never had an issue with the tone of her books as it relates to the story before. Please be kind in your comments when you tell me how delusional I am in not liking the sequel as well as “ The Housemaid.”",3
643,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","2.5 starsThat was... interesting.Not as good as the first book, that's for sure.It started off slow with not much happening in the first 30% of the book. It seems very similar to the first book in the beginning. Things started picking up around 50% of the book with the thriller genre coming in to play massively and since then, couldn't help but binge. Thetwists and turnsup till part 2 are really interesting and then it went downhill for me.After part 2the issues I had were all because of the two female characters.Am sorry as good asMilliewas in the first one, she is SO ANNOYING in this one. The fact she keeps on using Brock??? Like girl just stop please. I feel so bad for him throughout the book. If you don't want someone or don't love someone, just let them go!! Her inner monologues are so repetitive.Then comesWendy,I HATED her so much. She is such a narcissist, all I wanted was Douglas to just tell her her reality and find a life of his own. I wouldn't even mind if her pathetic little gold digging arse got killed off in a brutal manner. What she got was so mild compared to what she deserved.*insert multiple swear words here*Theendingwas underwhelming. The men in this book deserved better!! All four of them!!I for sure recommend book 1. Book 2? Not so much.",2
644,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)",I think I might have enjoyed this one slightly more than the first??,4
645,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","After thoroughly enjoying the first installment, I eagerly dove into this book, hungry for another whirlwind adventure in the world of Millie the maid. I can't help but keep my hopes high for the next installment, perhaps one where we follow Millie the social worker, assisting individuals caught in tumultuous relationships and dealing with dangerous spouses who mistreat their significant others. Personally, I'd love to see the narrative shift to focus on a husband's perspective in the second half of the book.I've come across several comments stating that the second book doesn't quite match the excellence of the first. However, I don't entirely agree with this sentiment. There are still incredible twists in this book that caught me off guard—not just one, but three brilliantly executed twists that took me by surprise. The first twist, while slightly more apparent, is not due to the author giving it away but rather because the book's concept encourages readers to think outside the box, fostering doubts about everyone's motives and leading us to suspect every move made by the other characters, all in an attempt to deceive us (or perhaps not-so-poor Millie, who retains her big heart to help others).In this new book, we find ourselves nearly five years ahead, witnessing the developments in Millie's life.At the end of the first book, she embarks on a journey to work in special homes, thanks to the highly-regarded references from Nina. Her mission is to aid housewives who have endured abuse at the hands of their husbands.Yet, within a few years, it appears that Millie has distanced herself from this perilous business. She particularly feels the void left by her partner in crime and her lover, Enzo, who had provided crucial resources to help abused women. Enzo's abrupt departure to Sicily to care for his ailing mother, coupled with his reluctance to specify when he'll return, leads to an amicable parting of ways. Millie begins dating Brock, a kind and caring lawyer with a critical heart condition who is eager to tie the knot soon. She also juggles cleaning and nannying jobs that come her way through word-of-mouth recommendations. Furthermore, she embarks on a journey to become a more effective social worker by enrolling in social psychology classes at a community college to better assist those in need.However, her latest gig ends abruptly when a misunderstanding with a child results in Millie being mistaken for the child's mother. The child's self-centered biological mother takes offense, leading to Millie's dismissal. Faced with no other options and fortunately without the need to move in with Brock (not broccoli), Millie manages to secure a promising job at the last minute. Douglas Garrick, a wealthy and influential business magnate, hires her to maintain his sprawling duplex penthouse, which he shares with his wife. Unfortunately, his wife's severe health condition confines her to her room for the majority of the day. The penthouse is largely spotless, with minimal chores for Millie—dusting, laundry, and preparing meals from recipes featuring obscure ingredients she's never encountered before. However, the pay and conditions are too tempting to refuse, and as the saying goes, beggars can't be choosers.Millie's plan is simple: follow her employers' instructions and avoid getting entangled in any family drama. But when she stumbles upon bloodstains in the bathroom and uncovers the reason for Wendy Garrick's seclusion—a battered and bruised face—her anger ignites. Despite the faint warning voice urging her to stay away from the family's issues, Millie can't resist intervening. Wendy Garrick, trapped with a monstrous husband, desperately needs saving, and Millie is determined to do everything in her power to rescue her. However, this time, the villain she confronts may prove to be more formidable than she ever imagined. To make matters worse, a relentless stalker is watching her every move. Is this threat connected to the Garrick family, or is something even more sinister lurking in the shadows, poised to threaten her life?Anticipating the big twist due to the first book's concept, I found the execution of these twists to be incredibly clever, with certain aspects even surpassing those in the first book. Upon finishing the book in a single sitting, I was so close to screaming and demanding another installment! I'm keeping my fingers tightly crossed that Freida McFadden won't keep us waiting too long for the next dance—or perhaps many more dances—in Millie's thrilling adventures. These books have become my new addiction, and I wholeheartedly recommend them to any reader in search of riveting, exhilarating, and breathtaking page-turners.I'm upgrading my rating from 4.5 stars to a solid 5, thanks to the clever twists, and eagerly looking forward to delving into more of the author's twisted tales sooner rather than later.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5
646,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","I don’t know how to say this any better, so here it is: I have read all of Freida McFadden’s books. I am a junkie for her writing. Now that they are finished, for now, no doubt, I may get more sleep and be more productive. Maybe cook a nicer dinner now and then.The books are all wonderful, very realistic, believable characters you want to be friends with. You should try some…but be careful, you too might have to read them all!",5
647,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","Dare I say that I liked this book more than The Housemaid?! Once again, McFadden delivered with some mindless entertainment (if you’re looking for a literary masterpiece, this isn’t the book). I was kept turning the pages, and not seeing all the different twists coming (like I did in the previous book).A brief summary… Our favorite housemaid, Millie returns to work for the very wealthy Garrick household. Douglas Garrick seems to be a nice man, but his wife Wendy does not leave the guest room. This seems very odd to Millie, and some strange occurrences start to take place.Once again, is Millie imagining things? Is Millie overstepping her boundaries once again? And why does she feel that someone has been following her? Don’t worry- all will be revealed with some surprising twists!Yes, there were a few discrepancies that I caught while reading this (but who’s counting, 😉), so I’m going with 4.5 stars rounded up. I will say that I do hope we see Millie again in a third book 🤞. I will also be cutting this review short as I plan on doing some cleaning up of my own 🧹🧽🪣I also recommend both The Housemaid and The Housemaid’s Secret as they are fun, entertaining, thrilling reads! Happy Reading my friends!",5
648,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","I enjoyed The Housemaid and generally think McFadden’s books are fun popcorn reads, but this sequel was godawful. Clunky, repetitive writing. Cringey dialogue. Predictable plot with a “twisty” part 2 retelling the same boring story from another perspective. Skip this.(( SPOILERS BELOW ))................................(( SPOILERS AHEAD ))....................(( LAST CALL - SPOILERS ARE COMING ))..............................(( HERE ARE THE SPOILERS ))..........After the events of The Housemaid, our girl Millie has earned a reputation among rich white ladies as someone who can take care of business (ie help them get away from their shitty husbands AND clean their houses and babysit - she’s the full package). Despite all of her Good Samaritan-ism to the uber-wealthy (because who needs help more than the 1%?), Millie is still super poor and struggling. So poor that she is forced to live in the South Bronx! THE SOUTH BRONX!Millie’s hot Italian groundskeeper boyfriend and Samaritanizing associate Enzo has a-gone-a back-a to-a Sicily to a-take-a care of his a-dying mama so Millie is living alone in her SOUTH BRONX apartment. But she has inexplicably scored herself a super hot and rich and nice lawyer boyfriend named Brock (which, side note: omfg don’t name a character BROCK, unless he’s, you know, a rapist swimmer douchebag), who loves her soooooo much and wants her to move into his swanky apartment OVERLOOKING CENTRAL PARK because he’s ready to settle down because of his heart condition (?) even though they’ve only been dating for six months and Millie stands him up constantly and doesn’t seem to even remotely like him as anything other than an abstract concept. She also hasn’t told him about her past, but really, really means to, eventually. But until then, she’ll just act shady AF and keep skipping their dates. Sounds like a solid plan.Millie gets a new job cleaning for another super-rich couple, Douglas & Wendy Garrick, who live in a fancy PENTHOUSE APARTMENT on the UPPER WEST SIDE, JUST WEST OF CENTRAL PARK which is super different from her poor person neighborhood (the SOUTH BRONX in case you’ve forgotten). Douglas seems vaguely hot-ish in a rich guy way, but Wendy stays hidden away in a guest room. Uh-oh.Then Millie thinks she’s being followed and she gets attacked by her skeezy neighbor dude (in the stairwell of her apartment in the SOUTH BRONX) and she stands up Brock a few more times and buys some weird rich people groceries for the Garricks. Then she sees Wendy with a busted up face and at some point Millie gets Wendy out of the PENTHOUSE APARTMENT ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE and to a cheap motel that is even worse than the SOUTH BRONX, but Douglas finds her and brings her back to the PENTHOUSE APARTMENT and continues to escalate the abuse.Then it turns out the person following Millie is none other than-a Enzo! He’s-a back-a from-a Italy and his mom is dead so he thought stalking Millie was the best plan to restart their relationship. He calls Brock “Broccoli” 197 times, and it was funny-ish the first time, but it got old real quick, and his accent a-comes and a-gos and he speaks grammatically perfectly for a few sentences and then-a goes-a back-a to not understanding English. It’s a real-a rollercoaster.Anyway, the two of them hatch a plan to save Wendy. Blah blah some stuff happens and Millie shoots Douglas and he’s dead.But.Then.The twist.The dude Millie shot is not Douglas! The real Douglas is a schlubby goober and not the handsome-ish man Millie killed. Oh dear.So then we have part 2, told from Wendy’s perspective. Turns out, Wendy is a gold-digging skank who only married schlubby Real Douglas for his money. She has an affair with Fake Douglas, who is married to Real Douglas’s secretary, Marybeth. Wendy and Fake Douglas make a plan to kill Real Douglas for his money… and to frame Millie for his murder, which really seems like a lot of trouble to go through.Jesus H. Ok. So, the gun Millie shot was full of blanks. Fake Douglas was fake dead, so then Wendy killed Real Douglas and made him real dead. Millie hides from the police because they are after her. Wendy and Fake Douglas go to his wife Marybeth’s remote cabin to hide out and do some hot-tubbing, but then a very angry Marybeth shows up and Fake Douglas gets his throat slit (!!) and Wendy gets killed with digoxin heart pills and is forced to write a suicide note explaining everything, so now Millie is off the hook. Yay.Then we jump ahead a few months, and Enzo is muscularly moving into Millie’s SOUTH BRONX apartment, and then Broccoli shows up to to pick up a box of his shit, and I guess it’s another twist that Millie gave Broccoli’s heart pills to Marybeth and that’s what killed Wendy.So, now Enzo and Millie live together in the SOUTH BRONX, and I guess she’ll find another cleaning job? Sigh.",1
649,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","Here's ""the dirt"" on ""The Housemaid's Secret"":1) Overall, this was a very disappointing and underwhelming sequel to ""The Housemaid"".2) In ""The Housemaid"", characterizations were strong and the story never dragged.In ""The Housemaid's Secret"" characterizations were shallow, the plotline was convoluted, and the story dragged.3) Although the book featured Freida McFadden's classic twists, these twists failed to ""sweep me away"" and, instead, left my eyes rolling.I listened to the audiobook and the narration was good but not great.It's no secret that I am a ""Freida Fan"" but, IMHO, this sequel was not one of her better books.2 stars rounded up.",2
650,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","I enjoyed The Housemaid with its brilliant twists and turns and couldn't wait for its sequel, which I received from Kindle Unlimited. Freida McFadden has shown she can engage readers with suspenseful and surprising plots. The author followed the same formula here, but I didn't find it as compelling as the first book. The characters were mainly unlikeable, except for Brock (Brocolli). I found myself feeling sorry for the way Millie treated him. She needed someone more exciting and considered him boring and too predictable.Millie has a great deal of sympathy for abused women and will do anything to ensure they escape from harmful situations and by using any means necessary. Unfortunately, she often goes too far, further complicating the situation. She felt greater entitlement this time, and I found her more annoying.She is working in a fabulous penthouse apartment owned by a wealthy man. The home is immaculate, with little cleaning necessary, only cooking, laundry, and shopping for groceries. Her wages are generous. The man of the house has warned her never to enter his wife's room as she is ill. Of course, Millie's curiosity and contrary behaviour causes her to open that door. She encounters a badly beaten and injured wife, who she is anxious to help.The twists are surprising, and soon Millie will find herself in trouble with the police. Instead of an explosive, shocking reveal near the end, I found the conclusion to be drawn out and tedious.I consider this a light, cozy thriller (with some killings), and I will certainly read more books by Freida McFadden as I have learned to expect the unexpected. 2.5 stars",3
651,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","Once again Freida McFadden releases an outstanding psychological thriller! This is sure to be a hit for those who loved the first one The Housemaid! The audio was condensed enough to finish in one day.Millie tells it from her POV and reminds us of her prison term she served. She doesn't share with her boyfriend, Brock, about her past because he is a successful attorney and afraid he will dump her.Millie is hired by the very wealthy and handsome Mr. Douglas Garrick. He is a demanding arrogant man that has specific rules she must follow. One rule is to not bother his wife Wendy who is ailing and does not come out of her bedroom. When she hears her crying one day, she opens the door to find her bruised and bleeding. She vows to help her escape from this abusive man.The second one references many highlights from book one, and better if it was read in sequence. It carries the same sarcastic humor and she displays the same confusion and controversial problems.I was turned down for the ARC by NetGalley and was so excited to get my hands on this highly anticipated book. Freida McFadden did not disappoint!",5

653,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","December 8, 2022...the day that Freida broke NetGalley! When it was announced in her Facebook group that 100 copies would be released by her publisher to her group members first, the hysteria was greater than any Black Friday sale I'd ever seen. I secured a copy, counted the minutes until work was done, and got home and started reading. Dinner wasn't cooked, texts were ignored, and laundry was overflowing, but nothing could tear me away from this book.Y'all. If you have to wait until February to read this book, I'm going to weep softly for you because this book is simply amazing. First, if you haven't read THE HOUSEMAID, get your life together and read it because you'll need the back story and characters to be established before starting this one. All I can tell you is that Millie became known for more than just taking out the trash in book one, and when she's let go from a lucrative job because an absent parent was chagrined over her toddler calling Millie ""Mama,"" she can't believe her good fortune when millionaire Douglas Garrick calls her to offer her a job.The Garricks' penthouse is stunning, and the pay surpasses her wildest expectations, but Millie is troubled by Mrs. Garrick's absence. Douglas explains that his wife is ill and sleeps a lot, which Millie accepts...until the day she hears crying from behind her closed bedroom door and finds blood on her white nightgown. She breaks the rules and knocks on the door, and when the door opens, Millie is stunned. She vows then and there to make Douglas pay.If that sounds wild, that's part one. Part two will remain spoiler-free, but you do need to know I exclaimed ""What the actual f*#k!"" more than once. Freida doesn't mess around with her twists, and they are delivered precisely and effortlessly. I've long given up trying to predict her endings; I just sit back and enjoy the dark humor that permeates many of her stories and trust the ride that she takes me on. Released to the masses on February 20, 2023, but when that link goes live on NetGalley again, you need to have your account in order!",5

Just when I thought I had things figured out, McFadden shocked me with brilliant twists and turns. This book was a well written fast paced thriller which I devoured.If you have not read,The Housemaid, I highly recommend it. This book does work nicely as a standalone but reading the first book gives you more insight into Millie and her need to help others. Millie is an interesting and fully fleshed out character. She has a prison record and takes whatever jobs she can to make ends meat. She it tough and vulnerable at the same time. She also tends to get into some interesting and tense situations.I found this book to be captivating, well thought out, perfectly paced and tense. I was on the edge of my seat, flipping through this impressive page turner.

Millie, yet again, was the epitome of naivety, with Enzo providing just the right amount of “wake the f*%$ up” mentality. Andwhile there were plenty of times where I felt like shaking her silly, I still found myself racing through the pages to learn all of the delicious twists. Granted, I had a hard time staying engaged through theslow burn start, but even that didn’t keep me from loving this journey through McFadden’s twisted mind.I do have to mention, however, thatI didn’t quite enjoy this one as much asThe Housemaid. Maybe because I didn’t know what to expect with the gaslighting and abuse (avoid both in this series if you’ve been the subject of either), butto a certain extent this sequel felt like a switched up retelling of the last book. Well, at the very least, the beginning did…The only other bit that bothered me was howfar-fetchedit felt. But if you’re willing to throw out your suspension of disbelief, it’sstill quite the chilling (and thrilling) tale.Done and dusted, I’m stillhoping there are more adventures with Millie and Enzoat the helm. From their sweet relationship to their righteous goals of rooting out abusers, they make quite the entertaining duo. So if you have yet to pick up a book by this author, give this series a try!Rating of 4 stars.Trigger warning: stalking, assault, spousal abuse, suicidal ideation, infertility, strangulation, death by gunshot, infidelity, poisoning, gaslighting",4

659,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","“She underestimated an extremely dangerous person. Me. And she paid the ultimate price.”I don't know if I should fear Millie or admire her because this woman is something else. At this point, I could read another two books about her and her vigilante justice and would never get bored. The way I love what she does for so many people who need help but also feels like she needs to be in therapy for her actions and thoughts.This wasn't like ""The Housemaid"" because the plot was a little boring but I can never expect a normal ending from Freida. This woman had me thinking crazy thought at two in the morning because I couldn't sleep. Some twists and turns were foreseeable and some out of the blue. I also liked to see Millie and Enzo and was glad it worked out for them in the end. I can't wait to read more about their lives in the next book.I was stunned after reading the ending. You can neve expect anything less from Freida. Definitely recommend this wild psychological thriller novel to anyone who love crazy and creepy plot twists and unhinged characters.",4

AND YET, she doesn’t try to get her ass out of the fucking situation.she’s one of those dense people who would be dead by the opening of any horror movie because they weren’t smart enough to leave the danger behind, and kept purposely ignoring all the signs. she refused to ask enzo for help until she ended up a suspect in a damn murder.also, the main plot twist (spoilers!wendy’s backstory, her tiresome plan, and her boring point of view) dragged on for so long, i was losing my fucking shit. her entire storyline just kept getting more unhinged with each page.like miss freida, what was that?never again, please.honestly, this sequel felt like such a mediocre way to drag on the series. it’s a cash grab, nothing more, nothing less.",2

In the first few chapters I felt this was going to be a mundane read; a!l of a sudden it took off. Its every bit as good as the first book and I could barely put it down. What a strange web we weave. Intense, thrilling with a twist that is totally unexpected.Great writing style and I'm sure to read the next one!!",4
664,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","""Millie, the heroine, is back, better than ever. Twisty, crafty, and humorous—this is one powerhouse of a series!""Freida McFadden, the queen of psychological thrillers with a twist, returns followingThe Housemaidwith the highly anticipated followup,THE HOUSEMAID'S SECRET.Cleverly plotted, complex and multi-layered, Millie discovers that she is not the only one whose life is built on secrets and lies and comes face to face with a master manipulator.Will she be able to turn the tables?It all started with a simple cleaning job. Now it might end with her blood mopped off the cabin floor. This is how the book begins and then jumps to three months earlier.Picking up from book #1, Millie finds a new cleaning job but loses it quickly when the woman's child, Olive, starts calling Millie mama.Millie has an apartment in the South Bronx with some freaky sleazy neighbors. She has accomplished quite a lot since the last book. She and Enzo (love him) have helped women and victims escape abusive relationships. However, he had to return to Italy to take care of his mom, and she has not heard from him. They made a perfect team and she misses him, but clearly, he was not coming back. It has been a year. Enzo knew about her past and she did not have to pretend around him as she did with Brock.She has also gone back to college to get a social work degree. She will be able to help people and stay within the confines of the law. Enzo encouraged her. For now, she is doing a part-time bartending gig but needs to make more money. That is rather difficult with her prison history.She has been dating Brock for the last six months, an attorney from a well-to-do family, but he does not know about her past, nor is she planning on telling him. He is perfect, except for a heart pill he takes daily for a condition he developed as a child.However, he is putting pressure on her to move in with him. That would solve her housing problems, but she just cannot give up control of her life. If she tells him about her past, she will lose him.Millie finally lands a job that is too good to be true. She meets a man named Douglas Garrick, who lives on the Upper East Side just west of Central Park, on the penthouse floor with a doorman. Like $20Million.The owner is the CEO of Coinstock and seems friendly but Millie cannot stop thinking about the closed door on the second floor. The wife who could not come out to meet her.She lands the job, but one stipulation is his wife Wendy is sick with a chronic illness and she stays in her room. Millie is not to disturb her for any reason. Tell someone they can't do something, making them even more curious.But Millie soon cannot keep from thinking about the woman in the room. She hears her crying one day and then sees blood in the bathroom. She must help her.

She cannot go back to prison. Nothing is as it appears.Is Enzo back? Will Detective Ramirez believe her? Someone is dead. Someone else will wind up dead.Told from the POV of Millie. Then we hear from Wendy's POV around 60% into the book, which is creepy, and flashbacks of four, three, two, one year, and six, four months before to a few weeks earlier to the night of the murder.Predator or prey? Cat or mouse?Wow! McFadden does a masterful job of creating in Millie a complex character, making her both scary, sympathetic, and appealing. A balanced thriller with dark humor that will keep readers surprised, pleased, and shocked as Millie unfolds her revenge comeback plan once again!Loved the Epilogue - three months later!Revenge drives this twisty jaw-dropping thriller, and the author keeps the suspense high throughout. As always, there is a twist you do not anticipate. Readers will root for Millie as she tries to even the score. How will she ever trust again?I loved Enzo, and he is a perfect match for Millie. Every time I read his name, I thought of Enzo (plumber) on the showYounger, also Italian that married Diana and loved him as well. I enjoyed this one even more than the first one and hope we get a #3 and more, Millie! I adore this author; the 12th book I have read by her (have not posted all the reviews yet).Thank you to #Bookouture and #Netgalley for a gifted e-ARC.Blog review posted @www.JudithDCollins.com@JudithDCollins |#JDCMustReadBooksMy Rating: 5 Stars +Pub Date: Feb 20, 2023Jan 2023 Must-Read BooksMy Review ofThe Housemaid",5
665,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","I liked Mille’s first story so I was beyond excited to see she was getting a sequel. I absolutely could not wait to read it, and I devoured the whole thing in a matter of hours. After the unusual events of Millie’s first book (which should absolutely be read before this one) she and Enzo do side work helping women leave abusive or unsafe situations. Mostly with lawyer referrals or fake ids but sometimes it gets a bit more extreme so Millie has a sort of reputation. But she has tried to put all of that work behind her and is taking college classes working to be a social worker and help in a more traditional way. She is excited when tech billionaire Douglas Garrick reaches out to see if she would be willing to clean and do some light cooking for him and his wife. But his wife doesn’t leave her bedroom and Millie has a bad feeling about this home. The twists and turns were great, an entertaining thriller for sure.",5
666,"The Housemaid's Secret (The Housemaid, #2)","InThe Housemaid’s Secret, Millie has moved on from her previous job but she’s still struggling financially and takes a new residential housekeeping job for a wealthy couple living in a beautiful NYC penthouse. Millie has been given strict orders by Mr. Garrick to leave Mrs. Garrick alone. She is ill and stays confined to one of the bedrooms. Despite her need for this job and the risk of disobeying the instructions given to her, Millie can’t shake the feeling that something is “off” and has to know for sure what’s going on in the Garrick household.Much likeThe Housemaidthis book is a popcorn thriller, with very short chapters that kept me turning the pages quickly.The Housemaid’s Secretwas a fast, enjoyable read.",4
667,Spare,"This is the most difficult review I’ve ever written. So much so I had 4 attempts at writing it, and in the end scaled back much of what I wanted to say (including 17 of my most important themes and issues), to just a core few. Unlike Harry I deliberately tried to moderate what I have to say, which is incredibly challenging when reviewing this memoir. It is also especially challenging but important to keep your review concentrated on what is actually written in this book (including its publicity) and for that reason, I have made great efforts to set aside what I know and what I'm hearing, because to review this honestly it is important to ignore the rumour mill and the other news stories, and set aside your own perceptions. So my comments are based on what Harry has written in his book and in part his media circus surrounding its publication. All in the name of privacy.The reality is this. I too can highlight the many holes and inaccuracies in Harry’s stories, dates, and his own conflicting verbiage. I too can lash out at his many frivolous and insulting remarks that were so unnecessary and excruciatingly petty. I too can argue that many of Harry’s claims are based on his perception and personal choice and do not come with a fact base or credible evidence. However, my dislike of this fictional story goes much deeper, is much more fundamental and gets to the heart of someone’s character, their motives, and principles or lack of. Now you can see why I struggled with this so much, yet much of my own personal views will remain private.Regardless of which side you take on this, everyone that cares enough will find this all very sad. I am sure there are lessons to be learned on all sides in this family saga, and no shortage of regrets. Yet one thing I know for sure, we will never get to the real truth because one side will not resort to the petty and sometimes damaging allegations made by Harry, in this book. So William is nothing but an easy open target because he is part of an establishment that “never complains and never explains”, even when his wife is subjected to abuse from the media (much more than Meghan over the years).The themes and core issuesWhose privacy rules and standards do we follow and when?By writing this book Harry has sought worldwide media attention. He has signed a multiple book deal, featured in the Netflix series and engaged in a number of nonchallenging interviews, which is completely contrary to what he espouses which is privacy. And by doing so he has denied the Royal Family the privacy he supposedly craves. He has broken the privacy rules with regards to the late Queen, the now King, the future King, his stepmother, his sister-in-law, his friends, wider family, and his army colleagues - just about everyone really and that I find incredibly hypocritical. He even has the audacity to complain about his mother’s former butler, Paul Burrell, in the book when he is doing much worse- in his book. This is sheer hypocrisy on a monumental scale.Whose safety do you really care about?The second issue I have is that Harry left the UK to allegedly keep his family safe. I say allegedly because the narrative keeps changing. Even after reading the book, I am still unclear what the current version of events are and what his story is today. At what point will he be or was he telling the truth?Here is my deep concern. By publishing a kill count of 25 Taliban fighter’s aka chess pieces (in his own words) he has increased the risk to himself, his family, and many others in military service. I find this abhorrent and immoral, because every death is someone’s child, father, brother, or friend, and even in war we should respect that. What prudent person publishes a tally? My GR friends may recall, I recently read Diamond Eye, where the MC was a female sniper and whilst a heroine in the eyes of many, she actually kept a body count of her kills which did not sit well with me, for the same reason. Respect. Who does that? Yet once again Harry takes no responsibility and has since tried to change the narrative by blaming the press for manipulating his words despite the fact that this sordid comment is written by him in his own memoir.Diana had two sons, remember that when reading this story. I for one will always remember the heart-breaking image of Diana’s two sons walk behind their mother’s coffin. A life changing event for the boys she loved, which caused mental health issues for BOTH sons growing up, something they jointly opened up about and campaign for. Yet Harry does this publicly to William.Whilst the pain is evident in Harry's story, I ask myself, what mother, and particularly Diana, would be pleased and supportive of a son who has consciously and deliberately set out on a campaign to work against the other. By writing a book that will be forever in print and with allegations that don’t stack up in my opinion, Harry has created this impossible situation for Diana’s eldest son, knowing that William won’t or can’t respond. Does Harry believe that the mother he refers to often in the book would be proud?. William is a soft open target for Harry, which is why I have lost so much respect for Harry having taken this course of action. It would appear he is emotionally obtuse or ill advised or both. Either way someone is on the receiving end and its Diana's eldest son who she was very protective off as the future King. A life she knew would be dedicated to 'service' and 'duty' while Harry had much less restrictions and more freedom. See here is the different lens to 'Spare'.Have you ever tried to warn a family member against their choice? It is not easy but what does a loving sibling do when you have deep concerns? You do what William did - voice your reservations, but unfortunately, this seems to be what sits behind much of this sorry affair. Harry doesn’t want to hear or accept it. From what Harry has shared it would appear these conversations did not go well, and neither son comes out blameless, particularly the one when William allegedly grips Harry’s shirt. A lesson I hope all will learn from. Time will tell who was right though.There was one point in this whole saga that had me seething and sad and its when Harry claims that William recently says …I love you, Harry, on our mothers life I love you… God you can hear the anguish felt by William in those words. Yet Harry admits to throwing it back in William’s face, and then this guy claims he wants a reconciliation. Sorry Harry, as was your response - I don’t believe you and bleep bleep to the rest of what you said here. Disgraceful.I’m in a minority here on GR, by rating this a ‘1’ because most people I know who have a problem with Harry’s behaviour, integrity, and motives for writing this book have chosen not to waste their money or time on it. Which potentially provides a distorted view of UK public opinion, in particular.Comments about the book’s writing style and structureHad Harry thought about what he wanted to achieve from the book, he might have structured the book differently and placed greater emphasis on what was important for us to hear and what was important for the narrative he wanted to share. Instead this came across as an emotional download and mental dump of Harry’s lifelong grievances, and aimed at anyone who had an opposing view. This does not make him a victim, instead the pendulum swung the other way and this overload for the reader just painted him as vengeful and spoilt in my eyes. Yet we do know from our own history that Harry had some genuine issues with the press for example (the press also managed his image during his years of alcohol and drug abuse -which he admits to in the book) but all this was lost amongst so much needless complaints and insults directed towards others, and I just reached saturation point, with little accountability accepted or owned by Harry.Let me explain what I mean about having an objective. For example, if you wanted reconciliation then share the wrongs in a considered and constructive way and explain what it is you hope to fix and then let your actions support that. If you want the world to know you are at peace with yourself, then remove these rantings, because this book has achieved the opposite. If this story was to expose the media as part of your unwinnable war against the press, then why attack William the way you have?. By trying so hard to paint himself as victim, he created too many so called ‘enemies’ that in the end you could see why some people like me could conclude that the common problem here is in fact …. Harry. I am deliberately leaving Meghan out of this review.In terms of writing style, the book felt as though it was written by many different authors. Clipped sentences were replaced with more descriptive prose and much longer sentences, which seemed at odds with a book that had so many chapters. However, it was a stroke of genius to narrate your own story. A very clever marketing accomplishment that no doubt will have lured people and captured the sympathy of many readers. Even I was moved in the early chapters when I relived Diana’s death in particular, but when the venom kicked in and the objectivity was notably missing. Harry lost me.Had a level of sensitivity and maturity been applied to this story I might have responded differently. Had he shown some restraint and not made such unnecessary and insulting remarks about other people, I might have had some sympathy for the unsavoury press coverage he receives. Had I not believed in my heart that this was financially motivated, then I would have reacted differently. Had I not found the level of hypocrisy so distasteful, then I would have appraised this differently altogether. Had I not read Harry’s own words then I might never have been aware that this was in some part or largely driven out of revenge or jealousy, for his older brother and an accident of birth that he was born second. And finally, had Harry applied some level of objectivity then I might have respected some of what he was saying. For example the royal family have chosen a different approach to dealing with the press instead of Harry’s unwinnable war and his 20+ lawsuits. They want to rise above it and often ignore the stories written about them and advised Harry to do the same. Not only does he disagree with them, but he actually accuses them of planting the petty stories, he refers to in his book. Really - just sit back and think about it!!!Unfortunately one of my biggest issues with this book is its credibility. Is the book to explain the narrative? or is the narrative being written to suit and sell a book and his story now?. Had Harry come out at the beginning and stated his case or even hinted at the hurtful and damming accusations he is now making about his family. Had we been given a glimpse of this story he is now pedalling, (with the exception of the media) then the book might have felt more credible, his version more believable. Instead, it feels like it is only after his proposals to become a part time Royal were rejected that he has decided to be angry with his family so much so that he needs to tell the world about it. You would want out of this situation altogether if all this were true - not negotiate a different ‘Royal’ role that would allow you to pursue the celebrity lifestyle and fame that this couple appear to crave. I know what I think but it is up to you to draw your own conclusions.There was something to be said about the mystery and speculation surrounding the RF which allowed people like me to keep an open mind, because I thought there was more to it than what we were being told. Harry has dispelled any of those doubts. There is nothing of substance and no significant revelations that would go any way to justifying and explaining Harry’s betrayal of his family and their privacy.In summaryHarry claims to have secured his personal peace, but at what cost? The cost of betraying his family, army colleagues, friends, and the institution of the monarchy whilst at the same time compromising the privacy and potentially the security of others, including his family. Publishing his body count was immoral and insensitive to those impacted and his military colleagues. The way he has attacked William, feels disproportionate to anything William might have done and if there was something else then I’m sure Harry would have told us. So all of this has exacerbated an already strenuous relationship and makes any kind of reconciliation unlikely, but certainly more difficult.In my view, his gripe over being a ‘spare’ is disrespectful to the institution and the tax payers who support it, Many of us who have witnessed Harry's indulgent and privileged lifestyle over the years, when he was 3rd in line to the throne, will find this discourteous. Harry has had life handed to him on a silver plate, had the best of everything, and lived in some stunning homes. Yet he is that out of touch with the 'public mood' in the UK and so blinkered he would hope you would see him as a 'victim' and justified in ripping his family apart because he has had disagreements with his family, he was born second and had a smaller bedroom in Balmoral castle for example. Enough. Please, no more.Some readers will feel empathy for Harry’s statement that the RF will someday regret not being there for him during the second most difficult period of his life because they failed to defend him publicly. Yet they DO NOT defend themselves, their wives, and the wider family because it is their motto to ‘never complain, never explain’. Not some elaborate plan to oust a couple that could have offered so much. Not a case of treating couples differently as they would have you believe. Perhaps the RF need to reevaluate this motto they live by. Perhaps not because by in large it has prevented them from being embroiled in petty skirmishes with the media, that Harry himself seems intent on having when he’s not using them to support his book or to his own ends. Instead, they have risen above it and not challenged the stories, and if Harry really believes the RF would invest time in sharing stories with the press over lipgloss, a flower girls dress or whether a prince should wear a beard - then I fear for him. So, by publishing this bitter book that is heavily weighted against and critical of William, Harry has likely created the second most difficult time in Williams life and this course of action was deliberate and venomous. You are right, there will be regrets someday and it will be for writing this book. Hopefully you have now exhausted your bile. Now ‘spare’ us any more of this!!!And to remove any notions of bias, as a pro royalist. I am not a Royalist or in favour of keeping a large royal family. Some maybe because of the charity work they do and the causes they champion like William's 'Earthshot' programme, which is the stuff we really should be focused on. I also have issues with the lives of some of the RF but I am not here to comment on those. I am here to respond to Harry's book, his one-sided oxymoronic self indulgent story and his unverified allegations.So please ‘spare’ us anymore of this. Please enjoy your life in America. I sincerely wish you do something meaningful with your life, instead of swapping financial support from the RF with money gleaned from attacking the Royal Family. Having listened to Harry’s story, I have come out of this believing the real victims here are William and Kate. William who conducts himself so well publicly, but is restricted by protocol and Kate who has always remained dignified and classy. A wonderful ambassador for the RF. If only they could tell their side of the story. Yet Harry would have you believe Williams story is out there and this is Harry’s chance to tell his - what an insult to everything we have seen, witnessed and endured. Spare us please. Go live your life.And no more memoirs for me. I found this too challenging but I stand by my considered views that I deliberated over for a long time, although it has still pained me to express them, because Harry was once my favourite Royal.",1
668,Spare,"I really enjoyed this on audio!! Over 15 hours in length, it's a big time commitment but listening to Harry share his story in his own words is totally worth it in my opinion!!Heartfelt and vulnerable, he shares stories from his childhood, about his mother, about life as a Royal, his military career and charitable work, meeting and falling in love with Meghan and their struggles being part of the Family and ultimately deciding to leave for their own safety and sanity.My respect for this couple is huge and I wish them nothing but the best! I'm sure he made a killing on this book deal but he has donated a significant amount to charities. If you are a fan of Harry or Meghan you definitely don't want to miss this!",5
669,Spare,"3.5 ⭐⭐⭐ I listened to Prince Harry reading this on audible and I was surprised at how quickly I got through it (then again, I have the ability to listen to audiobooks at a ridiculous speed and still understand what's going on). As someone who is British and has been raised by a family that are very Royal Family orientated, it was kind of a no-brainer that I read this. I may not have been born when Princess Diana died, it is an event that to this day my family still talk about and feel; but no-one could feel as deeply as Prince Harry himself. Whilst I am not going to weigh in on the whole Harry and Meghan debate that everyone seems to be having, I will say that I understand why Harry and Meghan made the decision that they did. That being said, I think some of the things they did could have been done differently. That aside, this was actually an interesting book, but like many, I feel that there are probably a few details he could have spared us...",3
670,Spare,"My curiosity got the better of me and I read Prince Harry's memoir “Spare”. In the opening section he describes meeting with his father and William who state they don't know why he's done what he's done so he begins by saying “Pa, Willy, World... Here you go.” And I think the main point of his justification is stated later in the book when he says: “My problem has never been with the monarchy, or the concept of monarchy. It's been with the press and the sick relationship that's evolved between it and the Palace. I love my Mother Country, and I love my family, and I always will. I just wish, at the second-darkest moment of my life, they'd both been there for me. And I believe they'll look back one day and wish they had too.” Throughout the memoir he recounts the events of his entire life and states his case against the press and his family's failure to act on his and his wife's behalf.Most of us have probably seen some of the shocking revelations and statements that Harry and Meghan have made lately in interviews and through their documentary series. This couple have been everywhere! Many are aware of the horrific abuse they've received by some of the press and public, the bickering between Harry and his family leading up to a physical fight with William (which is detailed in the book), the testy relationship between Meghan and Kate – all of which lead Harry to officially break away from the Royal family. I think it's been well covered already how Harry openly talks in this book about his drinking and drug use, losing his virginity and what were probably his biggest public gaffs of wearing a nazi outfit to a fancy dress party and using a racial slur when talking about a friend because he “wasn't thinking” and because of a “failure of self education” which he humbly admits he needs to improve. However, there were several things I read in “Spare” which I found surprising and I discuss them in this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRdsfxXzWwIThere's no doubt Harry has undergone an extreme amount of physical and mental hardship and he's shown great resilience. He's clearly a talented and dedicated soldier (and it's a shame he wasn't able to continue in service because of risks to him and his colleagues). He's in some ways an ordinary guy who shops at TK Max, eats Nandos (bizarrely he places an order for this during the birth of his first child while sucking down laughing gas to help calm himself) and binge watches Friends – but he's also obviously in an extraordinarily privileged position. As one example, he labels himself a Chandler and later physically stays at Courtney Cox's house. So there's this odd mixture of the mundane with the extraordinary throughout the book which I guess is the thing that really makes us so fascinated by the Royals and what Harry calls his “fancy captivity”.I felt a limited amount of sympathy towards him after reading this book and I think it's effective in showing his point of view but I don't know if I'm convinced he's right and those he's speaking out against are wrong. Or that anyone in this situation can be completely right or wrong. Many claims are made about leaks from within the Royal House to the press and how the Queen's close aides were basically manipulating her before her death. However, most of this comes across as conjecture and paranoia with little evidence apart from his word - though it's not at all surprising Harry would be highly suspicious given all the backstabbing and dirty deals that apparently go on in these circles.How much should we trust his word? He states early in the memoir that he has an extraordinary memory for spaces but not dialogue from the past. There are many conversations recounted throughout the book in which he comes across as supremely reasonable while others sound irate. Should we trust that these were the things actually said? They might be roughly true but it feels like they mostly emphasise the fact that this is a one-sided account. Overall, I'm just left feeling the entire Royal mess is in a sad state of affairs. I'm not sure if this book will work positively towards fixing things or just fuel the fire which he seems so desperately to want to put out. But it makes sense that he'd put this book out there and it seems remarkable that we now have such a candid account from someone in the inner circle. I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you have a keen interest in the Royals and are really intrigued by such a personal account. However, if you do read it don't expect any clear answers.",3
671,Spare,"So, I have always “liked” Harry. This memoir made me sad and sympathetic in parts, rather bored, but also somewhat interested; I did enjoy special moments about Diana, found an interesting new take on my original thoughts on King Charles, and confirmed my personal distaste for Camilla and Meghan. Unfortunately, I feel like he hypocritically is turning into the tabloid people he loathes and despises, turning family drama into a money source. In the end, he comes across like a grown man child throwing a tantrum and my eyes could not roll enough when she entered the picture. I am not condoning the paparazzi nonsense nor the rigid authority control of the monarchy, however if this is what you loathe, it is time to move on. Out of the limelight. No Oprah talks or other such bs. Move to your favorite place on Earth (Botswana) and make your way without the Crown. The end.",3
672,Spare,"30 pages in and it’s heart breaking. 100 pages in and it’s raw. The more you read, the less you can’t put it down.Harry shows the world with his book that he’s taking ownership of his story, in his own words.He comes off incredibly down to earth, accepting his faults, and humbling himself in a way unseen from a royal. I’d have a beer with him.",5
673,Spare,"2.5 stars. Very long, very boring. How can a guy who's lived this life be so boring!?I listened to the author read the nearly 16 hour audiobook, and let's just say he's not a dynamic reader. Nor does he appear to have much sense of humor. Mostly, he just comes across as a really messed up kid. And, yes, there are very concrete reasons why this kid is messed up.But in the end, it's a little hard to feel sorry for him. There's just too much airing of dirty laundry, too much ""woe is me"" as he throws every member of his family under the bus. It's undignified. Time after time he exhibits extraordinarily poor judgement. Nazi costumes? Strip pool? Years of substance abuse (about which he's very candid, if that's what you want to read about). And he's so out of touch with reality.But, mostly, he just seems pretty dull. Highlight: His years of military service, which reflect well on him. Lowlight: Excessive discussion of his frost-bitten penis. 'Nuff said.",2
674,Spare,"I wanted to like this book.""Time, as the doctor said, would heal my todger. But would it heal my heart?""The language volleys between eloquent and juvenile. Referring to his penis multiple times (euphemistically), this book can at times be reminiscent of a love scene from 50 Shades of Grey (see: ""holy cow!"") in its immaturity, but then, immaturity radiates the majority of this book.Immense detail is given to several, seemingly unimportant events. The appearance of rooms, for example, are described wonderfully (much as Harry said they would be, given how his memory works). Quite unfortunately, this measured and careful writing does not extend to some of the more sensitive topics.Harry's military service is discussed, and at first reading, it might even appear thoroughly so. However, the majority of that writing feels less about service, his tours, and his fellow soldiers, and more about how these people have served him. You might fancy the point of a book like this is to do just that, but it has come across as horribly rushed and botched. The end result was insensitive, and portrayed both Harry and the military as nearly animalistic.Although, what else could be expected from a man who described his once almost father in law as an ""alpha"" in the very same book?Harry's former girlfriends (and, indeed, his wife) are given bland, two dimensional descriptions. All of them are described not by who they are or what they stand for, but by what they have offeres Harry. Yes, he does say they are smart or funny, but their entire personalities are boiled down to syrup.Even their suffering is written as a misfortune to Harry. The detail of what those women have lost, what cost they have paid, and their (potentially? the book is unclear) continued harassment is lost to the reader, as it simply has not been included beyond what serves the author.All in all, there is too much to write. This book is nothing special, nor is it terrible. It is simply dull.Harry is neither intelligent nor unintelligent. He would not be out of place at the local pub. He is, in all honesty, just Some Guy who happens to be royal, and sadly, it does not make him interesting. If anything, it makes what appears to be a shocking lack of outside-himself thinking to be all the worse.If this book had some direction or message, if it had focused more on service and personal experiences unique to a Royal, it would have been a riveting read. As it stands, it reads more like an ever-changing stream of consciousness and whatever message (beyond ""fuck the media"") it held has been lost. It is little better than Prince Andrew's infamous interview, given the continued air of superiority (something the subject himself likely does not realise) and the lack of tangible explanation.His family and the media are pretty shit, too.",2
675,Spare,"It’s hard to separate the writing of the memoir Spare and the choice of content, but the writing was intimate—at times funny, at times biting—and took the reader on an emotional journey.In every corner of Harry’s life is the shadow of his mother’s death and the grief that still hasn’t fully been processed. It is the very through-line of his story. That little boy behind the coffin is never far away from the reader’s mind.There are moments when your heart breaks for Harry, like when as boy, he was convinced his mother hadn’t been killed, but that it was a public hoax so that she could start her life over somewhere. Or, when as a young man, he felt the need to go repeatedly through the tunnel in Paris at the same speed that killed Princess Diana.There are moments of such sweetness in his memoir: his overwhelming love and respect for his grandpa, his final tender memories of his grandmother, his adoration of Africa, and his awe of being a father. Harry also takes us on a journey as he falls in love with Meghan. We feel his true excitement that he could finally have a person. There are also times when we learn more about his ���todger” than we needed to know, though he points out that even the New York Times ran a piece speculating about his penis as a child (and whether he was circumcised). So, not even the privacy of his own body parts belonged to him. Still, it’s a bit much.But, the majority of the book covers his impressive public work and his military career, both aspects of his life endangered by being hounded by the press. It is a pattern in his life that those close to him have their lives threatened either by or because of paparazzi presence—once endangering a whole unit in Iran—meaning that few are willing to get too close or stay that way. It’s understandable that he would want to tell his story himself. Only, maybe we could do with less of his “todger.”Through the first third of the book, I felt that advanced leaks from the memoir were taken out of context and that his love of his father and brother shine through. By the end, it is clear that love is still there and strong, despite the gloves being off, but that Harry is choosing to protect his own family (his wife and children) in a way that he was never chosen and protected. (These warm fuzzies do *not* extend all the way to Camilla.)It’s apparent in this memoir that Prince Harry let down his walls and that he was willing to be vulnerable. He paints a very clear picture of why he had to step down from his role and move to protect his family and his own well-being, but the future of his relationship with his natal family is considerably murkier.",4
676,Spare,"If this had been fiction, I might have given it 4 stars. It’s actually very well written, and it reads almost like a villain’s origin story, which is always interesting. But since this is a memoir, I got annoyed by how bratty Harry is throughout it. He complains about everything and uses his oh-so-tragic upbringing as excuse to be horrid. He keeps using “the spare” as a crutch, as though being “the spare” should entitle him to something because life had handed him such a bad fate. At one point he even complains that he’s only 3rd to the throne. If I didn’t hate him before, I would now.The amount of entitlement in this book is so vile that I could not stomach to finish it. Barf",1
677,Spare,"Royal family gossip is not really of any importance, so here are the parts of the book which actually matter (and I don't consider these spoilers because they have been all over the news):- Harry reveals he murdered 25 people in Afghanistan.- He compares murdering people to playing video games.- The victims ""were just chess pieces"" instead of actual people.Some have defended Harry by saying""at least it's good that he owns up to it""and""he seems to have learned from it"".I, however, stronly disagree. Here are just a couple reasons why;- Harry implies he was ""only doing what he was told"". Not only is this a hideously bad excuse, it's also one that less privileged people wouldn't be allowed get away with.- He says the otherization of Muslims was part of military education. While without a doubt true, this is also another convenient way to downplay personal responsibility.- The rest of the book is basically Harry implying he's somehow now ""better"" than the rest of the cruel, racist, corrupt, criminal, bloodthirsty royal institution he used to be a part of (and in reality still is).What makes memoirs enjoyable is when the subject is truly willing to accept their own wrong-doings and take responsibility.Harry, clearly, is not.Nor will he ever face the consequences of his actions.Hence, this book shouldn't have been written at all.In its current state it's nothing but yet another slap in the face to those ""others"" to whom he, the Royals, the UK, and the rest of the Western war-criminals have caused immense pain and suffering with impunity.EDIT.Just to drive my point across, I'd like to share a particularly horrible section from the book:These were bad people doing bad things to our guys. Doing bad things to the world.If this guy I’d just removed from the battlefield hadn’t already killed British soldiers, he soon would. Taking him meant saving British lives, sparing British families. Taking him meant fewer young men and women wrapped like mummies and shipped home on hospital beds, like the lads on my plane four years earlier, or the wounded men and women I’d visited at Selly Oak and other hospitals, or the brave team with whom I’d marched to the North Pole. And so my main thought that day, my only thought, was that I wished Control had got back to us sooner, had given us permission to fire more quickly, so we’d got the other seven.And yet, and yet.Much later, speaking about it with a mate, he asked: Did it factor into your feeling that these killers were on motorbikes? The chosen vehicle of paps all over the world?Could I honestly say that, while chasing a pack of motorbikes, not one particle of me was thinking about the pack of motorbikes that chased one Mercedes into a Paris tunnel? Or the packs of motorbikes that had chased me a thousand times? I couldn’t say.Okay, a few comments on this:- It's 2023, and he is still trying to paint the invasion of Afghanistan as somehow moral and justified.- Notice how he uses the words""take""and""remove""instead of""kill""or""murder""when describing his own actions. Contrastingly, he has no problem referring to the people he shot as""killers"".- Harry seeks compassion and understanding from everyone, but did he (or will he) show any to the people whose lives he destroyed? Of course not; they are, after all, just""bad people""doing""bad things"".What a charming fellow.",1
678,Spare,"Edit/Update (1/12/2023)After processing with a couple of friends this week, I wanted to add a few things.The familial dysfunction that Harry writes about is something many can relate to. And, often it takes self-work and therapy to improve how you show up in relationships and the boundaries you are able to set as a result.Harry’s experience as a young child/person show the struggles he had with sharing his feelings and that as he matured and started that self-work, he was able to change how he showed up in relationships, how he showed up in his work. I saw a recent headline that was something to the effect of “Harry caught in cult of psychotherapy.” Harry obviously believes in therapy, believe in improving oneself and learning (as I believe there is evidence of), and if other members of their families do not or do on a surface level, then it is easy to see/understand how the rifts have continued to grow.While many of Harry’s experiences are obviously unique, what strikes me about Harry and his writing is how relatable he is. Of course I’m not royal, I haven’t had a significant loss, I haven’t served in the military. I have experienced toxic and challenging relationships, I have experienced feeling misunderstood, invalidated, and unheard.In one of his interviews Harry expressed that one of his goals in sharing some of the details he shared was to remind people that “you are not alone.” Talking about all of this helps reduce stigma on so many levels.There are some funny slightly awkward stories he included that made me laugh and I loved that because we see that playful nerdy side of Harry in his interviews as well.There will always be critics but I enjoyed reading Spare.Original review (1/11/2023): I felt as though I was reading a long letter from a friend. Harry shares his life, experiences, thoughts and feelings openly and compassionately. He tells it like it is—doesn’t sugarcoat and yet consistently expresses his wish for things to be different than they are. He calls out familial poor behavior as kindly and compassionately as possible while being firm and extending more grace than what is likely deserved.British media are ruthless, cunning, and incredibly heartless, focused on headlines and money. No one could or should have to live with the frequent almost daily vitriol that is spewed at and about him, Meghan, and their family.This is a very well-written book and I hope others will have more understanding and compassion for him and Meghan after reading—I wish them peace and happiness.",5
679,Spare,"I went into this book with an open mind. I am not particularly invested in the British monarchy, but it's been pretty hard to exist over the past few years and not be aware of the way Harry and Meghan have made headlines around the world - the effects of which have been polarising.In choosing the format in which to consume this book, I decided on the audiobook because I wanted to hear Harry tell his own story. And honestly, I enjoyed every second of his telling of it. Not because it was particularly juicy or salacious, but I felt there was a genuine openness and honesty about him sharing some of the intimate details of his childhood, his life, and family dynamics that were, at times, incredibly sad and heartbreaking. The actual content of the book wasn't even about ""spilling tea"" - yes, he shared some personal moments that I felt provided a lot of clarity and context, but nothing that I thought was necessarily disrespectful to anyone. Enlightening, certainly, but not ill-intentioned. At least I didn't think so. He also didn't shy away from addressing his own mistakes and errors in judgement. He speaks about them frankly and his remorse felt genuine.I'm not here to make the case that Harry is not a privileged man, or that he hasn't had the world at his feet from the moment he was born. That's obvious. But to be fair to Harry, he's not making that argument either. However, having privilege doesn't make someone unworthy of empathy. What Harry is saying is that there are loads of lies about him and his wife that have been smeared across tabloids for years - some instigated by his own family - and instead of remaining silent and allowing others to dictate his narrative, he wants to tell his own story, from his perspective. The idea that he should just turn a blind eye to falsehoods that are constantly circulated about him for clicks is absurd - would any of us continue to remain loyal to an institution that continuously lies about who we are and remains silent when unfair attacks and vicious racist rhetoric is bandied about for sport? I think not.And honestly, I'm not interested in listening to the opinions of 1 star reviewers who read an excerpt out of context and now think they're qualified to share their misinformed opinions. Or people who out of spite rated a book poorly purely because they hate someone for merely breathing. To those people, check your priorities.No one has to like Harry or Meghan, nor does everyone have to agree with the decisions they've made. But the levels of hate directed at them for simply wanting to set the record straight is mind boggling to me. They have the right to share what their experiences have been like, and after 5.5 hours of listening, I can confidently say, I get it.",5
680,Spare,"poorly written. the most florid prose i’ve read since i went through a bodice ripper phase when i was twelve!i finished it but i was left feeling like i’d wasted my money and my time.i wanted to believe harry, but the more i read, the less i trusted him. there were some things i’m proficient in that have nothing to do with royalty that harry just flat out lied about - after that i wasn’t sure if i could believe him about anything.it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.wait till you can get it from the library if you must read it, don’t waste your money!",1
681,Spare,"Trauma..it is the major theme that affects Harry - long past childhood, it ensnares him even as an adult.What can i say but this book is exceptionally well written...while I was reading I could feel Prince Harry pouring every emotion and you feel as though your there with him on every personal and private journey because he gives such detailed and clear descriptions.This book needed to be written to set it straight what is in Harry's mind. Remember the media hounded Diana and eventually had a part in her death by driving her like an animal they were in hunt for.he gives examples of what the British media has said about him and his family as well. His hatred of the British media and paps are well justified.I recommend this book to anyone who has had sibling rivalries, trauma, dysfunctional families and if you want to know what it's like living as a Spare in a Royal Monarchy",5
682,Spare,"this was a very long book but I still managed to finish it within a day because I really just wanted it to be over. Prince Harry has a weird narrative voice, almost comparable to the protagonist of a romance book?? I think the structure of this was good but overall this was kinda boring?? I feel like the media definitely played this up to be more than it was because I was mostly underwhelmed.",3
683,Spare,"Whew, there's a lot in this memoir. It was divided into 3 parts: childhood, soldiering & Meghan.I believe utterly that this is Harry's view of what happened. I believe just as fully both his brother & father would have many corrections to this narrative.I think we do hear from the family in the press, especially his Dad (Pa) & Camilla, indirectly, which is cowardly.I believe 100% that William made the comment about the color of Archie's skin, though the memoir never addresses it.One of the largest surprises was that William and Harry basically have had a nonexistent relationship since before Diana died.Long before Will met Kate and Harry met Meghan. Their fractured relationship really has nothing to do with either wife.The 2nd largest surprise was the sheer level of animosity William appears to have harbored for Harry, which is suggested to have begun in their childhood. Maybe sibling rivalry exacerbated by trauma? It comes off as incredibly petty given how much more money and power William has.William is an incredible bully. He never ever defends Harry but does call on him for help when he's being bullied by mutual friends of theirs.Harry longs for a deeper connection to his big brother, but Will honestly wants nothing to do with him.Their relationship is so distant that Harry & Will go on tour or engagement in Lesotho together after Will has become engaged privately to Kate. Will never even mentioned it to Harry. Harry finds out when it's published in the papers with the rest of the world.Also the family is so fucking cold that Harry's never hugged his own grandparents. It's implied he's never hugged his father's siblings either.Like you could melt ice on the asses of these cold hearted folks.I don't even understand this kinda relationship. Bizarre and unhealthy.That weird story in the press about Harry inheriting his mom's engagement ring and Wills having to ask for it to pop the question to Kate are all lies.The brothers also weren't each others best men at their respective weddings, just more lies for the press.I was surprised that Meghan's TV show had to have her scenes and dialogue approved by the palace before filming.Meghan was a fiance, not a wife, and already, her entire life was pretty much dictated by royal advisors at a palace she didn't even receive support from.Both Harry and the late Queen seemed surprised that Harry needed permission to marry Meghan. This felt odd to me as I fucking know this. How do actual family members not? The Queen didn't know which family members needed her permission to marry?Charles III does indeed suggest that he has no money to support Meghan after years of speaking about a 'slimmed down monarchy including his son's and their families'. This is shortly after setting up a trustfund for his Stepkids, Camilla’s children from her first marriage.The leaking between the palaces was harrowing. The Queen leaks against her family. Charles leaks against his sons. William leaks against Harry. Harry goes public with private family knowledge in puzzling and unnecessary detail.This entire family is a fucking mess.Harry is relatable with all his cannabis consumption, psychedlic and recreational drug use, drinking etc.He even used a tank of laughing gas when Meghan was in labor with Archie which I felt was a bit unacceptable.He talks about his penis, the todger, more than I'd like.Camilla suggested to Meg that Harry become the Governor General of Bermuda as they're having trouble with press when their relationship first goes public. This is before they're even engaged. So, the plan was always for them to scuttle off out of the limelight.Meg and Charles seem to get along well. Wills is put off Meg hugged him and didn't bow. Kate is unbalanced by Meg's Americanness.It's mostly manufactured nonsense.The ludicrous disagreements between Kate & Meghan are very high school mean girl- esque. I don't understand why Kate can't speak up if she's upset about the hormone cooment? It's weird on multiple levels to call a meeting and demand an apology months later. Just weird.Wills gets confrontational with Meghan and she tells him politely to get his finger out of her face; suddenly Will hates Meg.Wills struggles to control his temper in much of this narrative. He's petty, mean, bullying and fragile as spun glass.The so-called 'Sandringham Summitt' was a joke. Before the meeting started the Queen's office had already drafted a press release saying Harry & Meghan were leaving.So the 5 options offered were never real options.Harry was effectively kicked out of the family.He was promised security and continued financial support for a year.It turns out that too was a lie.Security was removed suddenly and without advance warning.His own father wouldn't even take his calls regarding this.Then they moved to Tyler Perry's house but quickly needed to get their own set up and right then Charles cuts off financial help.It's clear the family was trying to bully them back to the palace.See, removing security is what got Diana killed, no two ways about it. Her security detail would've never allowed what happened to her to happen.Charles knew that and William knew that. Not to mention his own Grandmother, the Queen.I'm shocked they gave so few fucks.Like whoa.Harry & Meghan's threat level was equal to the Queens. Higher than any other member of the family and still his own father didn't fight his loss of security or pay to replace it.The base toxicity in misusing power so oppressively. Then the epic level gaslighting to back it up.Shit with family like this, who needs enemies?I see why the couple is doing TV shows and writing books. Their security costs are outrageous, Harry has no marketable skills and little education. Meghan was basically a cable actress and only on 1 show at that.I would assume Meghan could get tons of work, but Harry is uncomfortable with her romantic scenes. I also think it is a class issue with their current titles and roles.So they sell access to their experiences, and honestly, I'm not mad at them. I think they are desperately trying to secure enough resources to raise their kids safely. They are also continuing philanthropic work which isn't as helpful as most think but can be noble I guess. Philanthropy is largely a tax haven but I digress.At the same time, even after comparing his family to a death cult, Harry doesn't denounce monarchy.He gives a couple 'lip service' passages to the evils of colonialism, but overall, he's a proud Brit and a monarchist.I didn't expect anything less, and that's truthfully why I pirated this book. The Royals are OG colonists. I'm never willingly giving them money.I wish Harry & Meghan and their little family the best. Meghan's the best thing that ever happened to Harry. They're a great couple and a happy family.They would've been a huge asset to Charles III and I do think in time their experiences will have a detrimental impact on the monarchy as an institution.The racism is obvious and epic. It will continue to echo through The Commonwealth.Ah may it all end soon:)I'd give this a 3.75 probably rounded to a 4 but given the racists have been bombing the reviews I feel.honor bound to counteract that with a 5 star rating.",5
684,Spare,This is just a continuation of Diana's story.A powerful highly dysfunctional family uses the media to discredit one another with lies.It's such a sad story... its about a family living in a type of emotional poverty they can't even understand.Harry broke free enough to see there might be a better tho not as luxurious way to live. I'm happy for him..that he has some clarity.,5
685,Spare,"This was a disappointing read that left me feeling decidedly worse about the toxicity of the royal family and bleak about any hopes of improvement. It might be worth a read for someone interested in the 'drama' of the royals, but anyone hoping for a decent piece of writing should look elsewhere.In the final chapters Harry does have some decent reflections on the absence of choice for this ‘unending Truman show’. It seems to me that ‘Spare’ is a very unaware rant about the hardships of life in the spotlight. These complaints are entirely valid, things like wanting security for personal protection seems eminently reasonable, until one is told of the insistence to not use inheritance from Dianne as it’s seen as rightfully ‘his children’s’ blunts some of my sympathy. The children of the rich and famous don’t strike me as especially needy…This is where the book falls short – what he and his family faces is truly monstrous, something I would wish on no one. But many of us face hardship, and we do not have a ‘Tyler Perry’ billionaire we can call to rescue us, free of charge. I appreciate this is not his fault, but he remains pretty tone deaf to this privilege. By his early 20s his lack of awareness that a Nazi uniform might be offensive, or that ‘Paki’ was a racist term, seem curious to me. He is very apologetic for this mistakes and I do not think one should be barred from growth. He argues it is our personal responsibility to educate ourselves – to look more outwardly and understand discrimination. True, but it seems to me that he does not reflect on why he did not know this. Was it the moulding of the palace? Or the locker-school-boy environment of Eton? He needs to take more ownership of these and imply less universality. Reflecting on a nice Ernest Henley poem he writes that ‘Every Brit knew that poem. Many had the first line by heart’ and then ‘what schoolboy or schoolgirl didn’t encounter at least once those sonorous final lines?’ The answer is simple, one that did not go through a privileged educational system.Despite this missed opportunity to reflect, my main issue with the book is one of length and overarching message. It’s ghost-written very well, in such a way that style or flair is sacrificed for ease of consumption.The best autobiographies shape narratives and themes across their pages. This seems more like a rambling letter of hate, a spirited censure of scorn. Harry Windsor has evidently been plagued by the press and deeply mistreated by his family. This book, if nothing else, should be a call for the British public to reflect on the lunatic state of the monarchy, the press that ensnares them, and our own interest that feeds this frenzy. Halving the length of the book and concentrating on some key themes, perhaps even media frenzy, might have made for a better piece of writing or work. He might have chosen excerpts of his life to recount of this frenzy and found ways of narratively tying them together. Thinking about other autobiographies I’ve enjoyed, Michelle Obama’s central theme of ‘swerving’ seems both robust and easy for the reader to take with them.Beyond this, it is the story of a man born with a silver spoon who might well have preferred a rusty fork. In the closing chapters he reminds the reader that he did not opt into this life, and that it has its own measures of hardship. I know I certainly would not want it, so why do we keep it? Why not shrink the monarchy and reform the press? Stop clicking the links, following the headlines, and let our obsession with this family die. So long as there’s some lingering interest, the media will continue to torment.",3
686,Spare,"I can't abide people who think they're blameless. This whole book is all 'poor Harry'. He doesn't blame himself for anything. He's been spoilt as a child and spoilt as an adult. Moaning when Charles cut him off and wondering how they would manage yet he still lives in a big house. Oh poor, poor Harry.As everyone knows Harry lost his mother when he was young. Yet so did his brother William. It is quite clear throughout Harry's storytelling that William cares about him a great deal and is worried about him and wanting to get him help. William can obviously see he is going the same way as his mother did (paranoid).The book does not have a male voice. It reads like a woman wrote it. Very flowery prose that had me laughing out loud a lot but mostly cringing! Harry is clearly besotted with Meghan but he thinks everyone else should be too so woe betide anyone who isn't...namely the British press, William & Kate. At first Charles loved Meghan but when he found out she was giving up her job and he'd have to pay for her it seems in Harry's eyes he went off her! The Queen loved Meghan instantly and it was even she who suggested Meghan write the famous letter to her father!The British press left Meghan sobbing and suicidal (she's always sobbing). Harry stated 'I'll get you help but first I need to go to this function this evening but you stay here'. 'No' cried Meghan 'I'll go with you'. There is then no further mention of her suicidal tendencies or no mention of getting her help. Harry himself though has a Therapist and turns to her a lot. At the end of the book he thanks a whole host of Therapists, so not sure why he didn't get one of them to help Meghan?!There is a distinct lack of Meghan's opinions throughout the book, so I can only assume she's writing one next and we'll get her side of the boring story. I can hardly wait..(rolls eyes).It left me feeling very sorry for William and Kate. Harry has a lot of digs at them both. I expect they had to just wash their hands of him in the end as William tried that many times to help him but Harry's sees it a different way. It was clear to me as the reader that William was very worried about him.Harry admits to taking drugs and still smokes weed. I think it's addled his brain. He clearly can't remember things correctly. He writes of the Queen as if she was on his side and states they had a secret special relationship (rolls eyes). Even after the Queen died he believes she appeared as a Hummingbird in his home in America! He's clearly away with the fairies!Hopefully he has his happy life in America (making money out of his fairy stories) and stays away from the UK for good.",1
687,Spare,"In the opening pages of this, Prince Harry says that shortly before his mother’s death in 1997, she had bought him an Xbox for his birthday.The first Xbox came out in 2001.That’s the level of attention that’s been paid to this book. And I loved every second of it.",2
688,Spare,"Well, not being a ""royal watcher"" or a fan of the ""prejudiced press"", and having been a psychotherapist for well over 40 years, I watched Harry's interviews with interest. What I saw was a man who had something to say.On Harry and Megan's tour of Australia their demeanour and kindness to fans was good to see. I wanted to know more.As soon as I was able I picked up a copy and started reading—albeit too late at night to get more than the introduction read.It's very well written, the story so far is more than just interesting, it's compelling, and I can't wait to get deeper into the book as soon as I can make the time. I'm impressed, and that's not easy to do.",4
689,Spare,"I have thoughts...To start, this book is readable, though wordy, and Harry shares a great deal of his personal life. The first section held my attention most, where he describes his childhood and then the loss of his mother. Very moving, and I teared up a few times. The rest of the book is a bit wandering, covering his time in the military and his eventual relationship with Meghan.The main issue I have that led me to give a 2 star rating is this. Imagine if your sibling wrote a book that was a detailed list of perceived infractions you'd committed against them for your entire lives. Most of us wouldn't come off looking great. I don't doubt Harry feels everything he's written is true, and it may be. Who can say, when reading about private family issues?I hope he's gotten everything off his chest, but I don't know how he can still seek reconciliation with his family when he's basically airing their business to the world.",2
690,Spare,"Putting my own personal thoughts on the monarchy aside, (and the fact that I'm nosy), Prince Harry's ""controversial"" and ""highly anticipated"" memoir, Spare, portrays himself as a person, who is breaking generational trauma and a toxic family dynamic (because they should ""never complain, never explain"").As a lover of history, none of what Harry describes shocked me, because he grew up in an institution that has - historically - been racist, oppressive and imperialist. Centuries worth of history is really shining through in twenty-first century Britain.Spare bared the similarities to the famous Burn Book from Mean Girls, because the amount of names and gossip that Harry exposes... It is quite unbelievable how much of this great gossip comes from ugly and uncovered truths.Throughout Spare, loss and trauma play a dominant role. His poignant memories of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and finding that ""mummy’s been in a car crash... They tried, darling boy. I’m afraid she didn’t make it"", were completely heartbreaking to read, particularly because I am someone who never got to experience the life of Diana when she was alive. The paparazzi slander in relation to Diana was intense, it is only right to feel anger when public figures are horrifically violated against having their own privacy. When Harry particularly writes that ""they can’t break me, I thought. Is it, I wondered, because I’m already broken?"", this highlighted the greater impact of the paparazzi on his mental health as a child.Unfortunately, Harry doesn’t write very well, which made the memoir feel poorly executed and ill thought - if anything, there were certain details that, I felt, caused more damage than good, as it gave a glimpse of Harry's taste for drama.For me, his memories of Diana were undermined by petty point-scoring in William and Harry's sibling rivalry. In several startling confessions of their physical rifts, it proved that this picture perfect family was crumbling behind the scenes. But as ""Willy and I would turn on each other"", I couldn't stop thinking about how William was constantly being presented as the arch nemesis, whilst Harry is the victim. Even when Harry discusses his brother's appearance in the prologue - the ""alarming baldness... His famous resemblance to Mummy, which was fading with time"" - it felt quite childish and petty, given that Harry mentioned in his recent interview with Tom Bradby that he hoped for reconciliation (not sure that will happen now though, Harry).He spared (haha sorry) us no details on his very intimate moments - from losing his virginity, to having a frostbitten penis, even doing mushrooms at Courteney Cox's house - all of which were... Odd to read, but I suppose since Harry had been silenced for so long, everything had to be spewed out.Harry admits that he killed 25 Taliban members during his time as a soldier in Afghanistan, which can be seen as victorious for some, however, this can be hugely damaging, not only to the Royal Family, but to veterans and current soldiers.There will always be controversy over his decision to publish this memoir. When reading, a part of me felt like he needed more intense therapy sessions, rather than spilling all his trauma onto a 400+ page book, but another part of me cannot help but think how liberating this was for Harry. With every page turned in Spare, you cannot help but feel as though your heart breaks for him. I am glad he got to tell his story (as a memoir, but I think he released far too many podcasts, Netflix documentaries and interviews that pretty much say the same stuff), regardless, I still highly recommend.",4
691,Spare,"his ghostwriter is goood, it’s a very scathing book especially towards the press and Charles and camilla and William and all these newspaper headlines have taken a lot of out context .Having said that it’s interesting to read his events of things - makes me wonder if they all keep a journal lol.but there’s a lot that wasn’t understood properly I think - and that apparently he said in the interviews too about racism and unconscious bias. The book was more about his redemption arc and him v the powers",4
692,Spare,"Just a long long whinge. And some of the seemingly profound stuff, made me roll my eyes saying “how dramatic, grow up and get on with it!” But looking at the sales today and the curiosity with which people like me are going for it, seems like the best laid plan for retirement. 🙄",2
693,Spare,"I can't understand why so many are hating on this book. I found it fascinating. If for nothing else, it gives first person insight into an insular (and quite drafty) institution. I found Prince Harry to be quite caring and insightful. Yes, I realize it's his story told by him via professionals who are hired to portray him in the best light. But, who can possibly imagine a lifetime under such scrutiny. He was born into a life he didn't ask for, doesn't want, and a life he can never truly escape.The little insights were truly interesting and just written as if everyone is bathed by other people, we all walk by our father's room as he's being dressed by his valet, or bagpipes are played at the request of our grandmother. Such a different life!I think living away from the royal life will be healthy. His smile seems more genuine in the interviews promoting the book than when he was forced before ""the wall"".I do hope they scale back more and more and live a more common life. Photo opportunities where an entire village come out to dance and perform for them is one thing. Living a more humble life is another.",5
694,Spare,"After reading this book, I feel like I know Prince Harry inside and out from some of his deep inner thoughts and his perspectives on life.There are three parts of the book. It starts with his childhood growing up in private schools and then feeling the pain and shock when “Mummy” died. It took years before he could accept that she was actually killed in an accident.The second part is about how proud he was to be an important part of the British Army. He finally felt like he was able to contribute toward helping his country and soldiers.And finally, the last 100 or so pages are about his love for Meghan Markle. I don’t know why he included her last name as everyone knows who she is.Throughout the pages, he includes thoughts on grief, racism and psychological pressures of being stalked by the press. He shares his relationship with his grandmother, the Queen, his father, now the King, his brother Willy and his Aunt Margaret. He said she was also a “spare.”“Even my father reminds me that unfortunately Willy and I can’t be normal…in which normal events were treated as abnormal, and the abnormal was routinely normalized.”Every reader will have an opinion about Harry and the Royals after reading this book. The Press was constantly following him as lazy, a drug addict, single with no prospects and actually comparing him to Bridget Jones…really? They talked about his ratty shoes and mismatched outfits.Later, his girlfriends were followed by the press and then there was his life with Meghan when he was finally happy. He was told that it will be difficult for her. Yet, the press wanted him to be married. Most of us know he ended up leaving his beloved country to find a better life.To live without freedom from the press made him want to expose every secret so there could be nothing left except a man with his wife and children wanting peace.",4
695,Spare,"Edited to clarify my thoughts on January 13, 2023This book was revealing, but also frustrating. Harry spares no punches rightfully pointing out where others have done wrong. However, he fails to consistently apply this same critical eye to his own actions. While he sounds like he feels bad for his missteps, he attributes them entirely to his upbringing with little interrogation. For example:1. Making a big deal of Will and Kate laughing at the Nazi costume. It was wrong of them to laugh and encourage him; however, it was more wrong of him to choose and wear the costume.2.He lets himself off the hook for his Pakistani slur because he grew up sheltered and his one Pakistani friend forgave him.3. He physically attacks his bodyguard while drunk.4. One passage that really struck me was “Meg said something I took the wrong way. It was partly a cultural difference, partly an language barrier, but I was overly sensitive that night. I thought: why is she having a go at me? I snapped at her-spoke to her harshly-cruelly…” Harry alludes to saying something awful to Megan, but never says what it was. Could it have something to do with his prior comments about her at the beginning of their relationship, which were quite judgmental for somehow who is sick of being judged by others.Next to Harry, Prince Andrew gets the kindest treatment of the royals, being referred to only as ""embarrassing""(he sounds more upset about Kate asking Meg to apologize for the baby brain comment). I didn't expect something earthshattering, particularly given his friendship with Eugenie, but I think Andrew's actions merit a bit of a harsher adjective than ""embarrassing""Some more petty thoughts:I still don't believe WIlliam and Kate were huge Suits fans. The show is not that good.2 I still don't believe Meghan never googled the Royals. She is an intelligent woman and that is literally the most basic thing you do for anyone.3.I never want to hear about a frostbitten ""todger"" again.If this book accomplishes is to stop the belief that Meghan is a diabolical, controlling mastermind because no one looks good in this book, so I doubt she had any hand in it (she's far too PR savvy in a good way for that). This is all Harry (and his ghostwriter).One stylistic gripe: there were far too many chapters. The book was split into 3 parts, each with about 50-90 chapters. In a book under 500 pages. To me, this detracted from Harry and his GW's ability to actually write a compelling, cohesive narrative. Overall, this was fun, but would have been better with more self reflection. 3.5/5",3
696,Spare,"How would you feel being born as a back up or a Spare?Love him or hate him, Believe him or not, We all have are own throughs and view on him and these ones are mine.Ive never been a big fan of the Royals but ive always liked Prince Harry as i feel like he is the only one who is true and real so reading Spare just made me believe this more and have more respect for him.Yes hes a Prince but hes a human too he makes mistakes just like us all and in this book he tells us of them. There also some interesting (sometimes funny) stories about love, loss, life, duties, family, time served and mental health.I enjoyed this book so much was so nice to hear about his life from him with his vouce and words, not via the press who lie and will pull this book apart and changing the words around to suit them So why shouldnt Harry tell his story his way its his.This book is extremely well written, beautifully and richly detailed. The Audible is also well read by Prince Harry.Its heartbreaking to hear him talk about the lost of his Mother, the fall outs with his family but what respect i have for him to stand up for himself, Meghan and Kids to feel safe.I stronging believe that William hates the fact that he cant be more free as hes next in line for king. Also i believe that Kate didnt like that Meghan came into the picture and she had to share the lime light with this successful, independent woman in her own rightand this made them turn on Harry.Highly recommend you read this book.Phenomenal and Refreshingly honestSo i ask you againHow would you feel being born as a back up or a Spare?",5
697,The Perfect Marriage,"When I'm feeling a reading slump coming on, I usually pick up a nice fast-paced thriller to get me back into things. According to the reviews,The Perfect Marriageshould have been that. All I can say is I guess it's true that it did make me want to read literally anything else.I don't get the hype. The writing isn't great, needs at least another round of editing, and there are plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon. Everything is obvious, yet also verging on ridiculous, and people (mostly Adam) act absolutely moronic for no reason whatsoever.Everyone is awful, and not in an interesting way. Adam is the doucheiest misogynistic alpha male douchebag, not to mention a total dumbass, who seemed to do everything within his power to make himself look guilty. Sarah has to whisper ""bitch"" to herself whenever another woman in the room doesn't kiss her arse.The police investigation is laughable, so is the fact that they would charge Adam and send this to trial without accounting for several anomalies that showed up in the ""evidence"" (like someone else's DNA). Sarah, a lawyer, gets more facts on this case than the police have by simply having a conversation with the victim's colleague, which I guess the police neglected to do.And that attempt to explain away the shoddy investigation with the ""oh, it was the sheriff's DNA"" left me far more annoyed than satisfied. Way too convenient and it didn't make any sense.Also, was Kelly in an abusive relationship? Because I'm pretty sure that wasn't cleared up(?) I don't like when a character knows something is or isn't true because they see it in someone's eyes, or some other such nonsense, but then it turned out that maybe he was lying? Who even knows?So many other things I could whine about. The dialogue and the characters' actions all seemed so juvenile; not a single member of law enforcement or attorney behaved with a hint of professionalism-- all of them acted seedy, violent or just plain stupid. I got the sense that the author had no idea about criminal investigations or court proceedings.It is irritating when I put things together way before the characters do and have to watch them scratch their heads and think ""where have I seen this guy before?"" It is also irritating when characters act one way for the entire book thenturn to the audience and mwahaha at the end.So much doesn't make sense. The outcome of this book is only reached by having everyone be stupid and do silly things for no reason.",1

699,The Perfect Marriage,"Oh, honey, no. The writing is so bad and is trying so hard to be good that it's painful to read. The syntax is constructed so strangely that it's actively distracting. There's no character development. The plot doesn't make sense.I have so many questions, and none of them are good. Did this ever see an editor’s desk? Did anyone think to google the legality (or even the ethics???) of a spouse representing their partner in a murder trial? Did anyone suggest that maybe investing a little more time in the characters and their development might make the story work even a little? Did no one mention the whole ""show, don't tell"" part of good storytelling? Why does this have so many five-star reviews?This book definitely thinks it’s the next Gone Girl, or Shari La Pena, or Ruth Ware. It's trying so hard to be a twisty psychological thriller, and it fails at every single level.This isn't it. WOOF.",1
700,The Perfect Marriage,"Ew.This is a 100% big nope from me.From the gratuitous bad language (does every single character need to use the f-word twice in every sentence? Does the main character need to whisper ""bitch"" every time she walks past another woman?) to the wooden characters to the stomach turning conclusion, there's just nothing about this book that I can say that I liked.I read this book because I had seen so many people say that it was amazing and had so many twists. Those people must not read the same thrillers or as many of them as I do because this one was just bad on many levels. Don't get me started on the author's lack of legal and police investigation authenticity, it is laughable. So. Many. Plot. Holes.Another book that I'm glad I read on KU and didn't actually purchase. I'd recommend giving this one a big pass. I'm heading out to take an antacid so that I can get try to get this sick feeling out of the pit of my stomach.",1
701,The Perfect Marriage,"**Spoilers**........A first-person unreliable narrator for a story that made no senseLawyer wife sets up her cheating husband for the death of his pregnant mistress and the excuse is she didn't want to give him half in a divorce?Clearly, Rose did no research because the funny thing is Washington D.C. is not a community property state, so, really, the story is redundant. Moreover, the wife, Sarah Morgan, could have simply gotten a divorce but to take another's life because they dipped the quill in the inkwell is not good enough.There are people in prison for stealing a backpack, and this woman kills a pregnant woman and eventually her husband yet somehow is absolved because the husband cheated on her?I don't like it. It's gratuitous and excessive and far too indulgent.",2
702,The Perfect Marriage,"What the hell did I just read? I hate this book. I loathe it. I want to burn it into ash.“Those are strong feelings” you might say to yourself. Well trust me when I tell you that this book is NOT WORTH IT.First of all, everything is so incredibly obvious, that the fact that they seriously titled it “a completely gripping psychological suspense” is so laughable. It was none of those things. It was sloppy and messy and the writing was so awkward that at times I found myself asking if I really just read the sentence that just came out of a persons mouth.And let me tell you something: I am so sick of these people writing about protagonists who talk as if they know nothing and then turn around and are the ones who committed the crime.YALL ARE NOT GONE GIRL.Gone Girl worked because Amy’s diaries were in the past. As soon as it switched to after, she was all “hahahaha I’m awesome I got away with it” all things she was thinking about THE WHOLE TIME. You can’t stick me with someone who acts surprised and upset and affronted when presented with evidence of murder when YOU ARE THE ONE WHO DID IT. Thoughts do not work that way. It is not possible to sit through an entire book of present-time thoughts and not once think about how great you are that you’ve pulled this off. I don’t buy it.It’s the worst trope out there, and it really just makes no god damn sense. Stop trying to pull one over on me and make it actually thrilling.And pro tip? If you want me to believe someone didnt do it, don’t make them say shit like “I’m the only one who can do this and you know why”. Yeah, I do. Because you’re the person!!! Ugh.This book was horrendous and I can’t believe I wasted so much time being even slightly intrigued by it. Do not do the same. Save yourself.",1
703,The Perfect Marriage,No.,1
704,The Perfect Marriage,"The writing is so bad that I’m genuinely suspicious of the 5 star reviews.The characters are poorly written, between the lawyers and police officers, not one of them is professional and/or good at their job.The main character is supposed to be an outstanding defense attorney but just lets it slide when she gets attacked by a police officer while at a police station, and doesn’t make a scene when the rest of the policemen don’t act professionally during an interrogation? Yeah, okay- definitely believable.Also, early in the book the assistant offers to cover a 300 dollar lunch tab, unless she’s using a company card I have a hard time believing she is getting paid enough money to pay for her boss’s lunch.I could not even finish this book because it was so terrible.",1
705,The Perfect Marriage,"As a lawyer who specializes in criminal work, I couldn’t stomach this book. The relationship between the sheriff and the female lead is ridiculous and unrealistic. For instance, a sheriff would never allow a defense attorney to sit in while questioning a potential witness. Then there is the representation of her husband. That is so wrong for so many reasons. No logical defense attorney would believe she could do a better job than an impartial attorney with no familial connections. Especially considering the victim is the husband’s mistress. It would also be a major conflict for her to take her husbands case since she is a potential witness.As for non-lawyer reasons for a two star review: I hated the characters. They all sucked. I didn’t like or root for a single one. I didn’t care what happened to any of them, good or bad. For all those reasons, I strongly disliked this book.",2
706,The Perfect Marriage,"1.0 stars— First the good about this novel — I finished it.I chose to read “The Perfect Marriage” after looking through the highest rated thrillers on Kindle Unlimited and discovering a very high number of 4 and 5 star reviews. This is how I discovered Colleen Hoover’s “Verity,”and I still consider it one of my favorites. “The Perfect Marriage” has a good framework as it begins with Adam being charged with murdering his lover. He “naturally” decides to let his jilted wife,Sarah, represent him on what is literally a life or death case. The book is written in the alternative perspectives of Adam and Sarah and neither one of them is even slightly likable. They both cuss like sailors, treat everyone in their life horribly and are as arrogant as any two characters I have ever read. Throw in Adam’s vile mother, Elenor who never says or does anything nice and you have a cornucopia of nastiness no matter who you are reading about. The plot itself is ridiculous with stilted dialogue, decisions that defy common sense, and a lack of knowledge of what happens during murder investigations as well as criminal and legal procedure that is embarrassingly bad. I should of put the book down as soon as the sheriff allowed the attorney for the defendant to be a part of the murder investigation and in some cases direct it. This NEVER happens … ever. All in all (if you couldn’t tell) this one wasn’t for me.",1
707,The Perfect Marriage,"tl;dr: this is the worst book i have ever read.if i could choose any book to burn this would be the one. this is THE WORST book i have ever read. i honestly felt like ripping my hair out everytime i read it. the writing is so horrific, i felt like i was reading a 13 year olds wattpad book, or worse... my year 8 creative writing (obviously not including the disgusting smut in this book). the perfect marriage is trying to become the next gone girl and it is failing.... miserably. the dialogue in this book is truly one of the worst i have ever seen. it is so stunted and its very hard to believe that it could be real.ALSO can we talk about the legal side of this book?????? i'm certainly no author (or lawyer) but i'm pretty sure that authors do research before they begin writing?? so the book is accurate??? anyways i don't think that jeneva rose did a single bit of research regarding legal proceedings or anything (and i'm no expert).let me elaborate. firstly, a wife.... defending her husband.... in a murder case???????????? WHERE THE VICTIM IS THE HUSBANDS MISTRESS??????conflict of interest much??? it is beyond me that only two characters mentioned a conflict of interest throughout the entire novel. not to mention the ethical issues with that. i get that its technically legal but there is still a lot of problems with it especially in a case as serious as murder. AND sarah is technically a witness? she was the person to see adam right after the murder took place...another nitpicking thing... if you are on trial for murder, you cannot be placed on house arrest?? adam is on trial for a very violent crime, he can't just be on house arrest. according to brittanica, 'violent offenders are not considered eligible for house arrest'. regardless of whether adam actually committed the crime, it is a very dumb idea for him to just be in his house. ESPECIALLY the house where the murder took place?? HELLO???? literally a couple days after kelly was murdered adam was back in that very house, sleeping in the same room and everything. i get that they can't keep the crime scene there forever but surely thats not a very good idea.okay, next thing that i hate about this bookTHE CHARACTERS...i have never read a book where every character is the worst ever until i read this book. every single character, every single interaction is so bad. the lawyers, policemen, and basically any other adults with jobs acted so unprofessionally it was just funny. they had no idea how to do their jobs and why were they tackling eachother all the time??things i hate about sarah1. i get it. you're a successful female lawyer. cool. now stop talking about it for one page please2. her louboutin heels.3. her assistant. the most annoying stupid character i've ever seen.4. SHE NAMED HER KID AFTER THE WOMAN SHE KILLED.things i hate about adam1. everything. literally everything2. his mum3. how he literally slept with another women for a year and gets mad when sarah flirted with the sheriff? someone please humble this man4. how he hates the fact that sarah works and gets ALL the money for them? like shut up you don't do anything and get mad because your wife is at work all the time?? get a real job adam5. how he enlists a random 'reporter' to help him solve his case and immediately trusts her with everything?? and then kisses her. good job adam!okay last thing i swear. THE PLOT HOLESthere were so many plot holes the book made zero sense. from a random person coming into sarah's house in the middle of the night to have sex with her (never mentioned again) to kelly being murdered while adam was sleeping RIGHT NEXT TO HER?? and then when adam left the lakehouse he touched kelly you know.. down there.. and concluded that she was very wet (yeah. that happened). surely if it was blood it would of been on his hands or somewhere on him?other plot holes- the police leaving a literal door open in adams cell (i think it was a cell) so he just left and hid in the woods??!??! this is less of a plot hole and more of a ?????- if bob and sarah were in it together why did they have private fights with eachother? especially about sarah taking on the case. if bob was in on it why would be come up to sarah and argue about that when there is nobody even watching them- the entire ending reveal? there was nothing throughout the book that even suggested that sarah and bob were in on it together. if there were a little clues (like most thrillers) that kind of gave away who it could be it would have been so much better. BUT THERE WAS NONE OF THAT!thanks for reading... sorry i got a bit into it.",1
708,The Perfect Marriage,"FYI saying a policeman “decided to go Rodney King” on someone isn’t cool or funny at all. Also the use of slurs for literally no reason was completely unnecessary from a white female author and added nothing to the story. This whole book is just a massive cringe & beyond offensive to several marginalized groups of people. Do better, Geneva. Or just stay out of literature pls n thx.",1
709,The Perfect Marriage,The writing in this book is horrifically bad. It sort of feels like a thesaurus threw up in the author's attempt to sound smart and it's quite painful to read. The dialogue was stunted and so odd to read and the narrative is not any better. None of the characters are likable and there's zero character development. The plot makes literally no sense and is extremely far-fetched. I don't think Miss Rose did even five minutes of research regarding police work or law. It was all just a big no from me.Booktube|Instagram|Twitter,1
710,The Perfect Marriage,"The Perfect Marriage has everything I could want in a thriller: Mistress of cheating husband is murdered and who out of all these sketchy characters did it?The story pulled me in pretty quickly and was engrossing enough to start. I even really enjoyed the ending although horribly predictable.My gripes might sound nit-picky but I’m choosing to bring them up because they deterred me from fully enjoying the story.There were a handful of discrepancies I couldn’t get past.1. The title is not aptly named at all. I have read many a book where the marriage seems great on the outside but is horrible on the inside. It never showed Sarah and Adam having a flawless marriage as they never seemed to be together with her always working and him always at the lake house.2. After an embarrassingly long time of researching this on my phone, it looks like situationally a lawyer can defend their spouse. This is not one of those situations as it is too much of a conflict of interest.3. A couple things were brought up as seemingly important and were never circled back to again. For example, Anne and Sarah had an ‘awkward moment’ at the bar. I kept wondering throughout the story what Anne said to make this awkward and it was never brought up again.4. Warning ⚠️ : This one is a little gross and possibly a minor spoiler. When he leaves the cottage, Adam touches Kelly’s leg and notes that she’s wet and wiped it on his pants. She was already dead by this point. Stabbed 37 times. I assumed that would come back as evidence against Adam seeing as how she couldn’t have been ‘wet’ if she was dead and if it was blood, it would have been on his pants when he wiped his hand. This was never circled back to.5. Warning ⚠️: Minor spoiler again. Scott was supposedly suspended after beating up Adam. He never goes through any time off for funeral arrangements for his wife and all of the sudden he’s handling Adam’s breaking house arrest then beating up Bob then put on suspension again? Wasn’t he already suspended? How long does suspension last? Isn’t all of this a big conflict of interest because of messes like this happening? Then Sheriff Stevens asks Bob if he wants to press charges but he never asked Adam that when he got beat up.If you can look past the discrepancies and inconsistencies this could be a good book for you. I’m a very meticulous person to a fault (a blessing and a curse) and I just couldn’t overlook these.I will definitely pick up something else by Jeneva Rose in the future as I do like her storytelling. However, this had too many things working against it for me to rate this higher and I hope it’s just because this is a debut.2.5⭐️ rounding up.",3
711,The Perfect Marriage,"2.5*Oh my! Almost at a loss for words...Almost!I was really looking forward to this audio, as domestic thrillers are one of my favorites to lose myself in.Well this one sadly did not live up to my expectations.Adam is having an affair. His wife Sarah is too busy at her law firm to have time for him so he looks elsewhere for his companionship. And the woman he falls for just happens to live in the town where Adam and Sarah have a vacation home. Well that’s convenient! Oh yeah, did I mention this woman Kelly also happens to be married!?💁🏻‍♀️When Kelly turns up dead, of course Adam is the prime suspect right off the bat. And Sarah needs to step in as his lawyer to save him.Eeks!😱I thought the premise sounded terrific and was chomping at the bit to listen to this audio. Unfortunately it just fell far short of my high hopes.Was it the storyline? Perhaps. I felt no real connection or empathy towards any of the characters.Could it have been the audio version? Maybe. When I listen to an audiobook I want the narrators to breathe life into the characters and make them real. I didn’t feel that at all.There are a lot of mixed reviews for this book so I truly hope you enjoy this one more than I did.Thank you to NetGalley and Dreamscape Media for an 🎧 To review",2
712,The Perfect Marriage,"Disappointing. Started off promising but rushed at the end with too many plot holes. If you’ve read Gone Girl, you could see this coming, but without the details that truly pulled it all together. Ending was disappointing. I was left feeling “that’s it?”",1
713,The Perfect Marriage,"“Don’t call me Cubby Bear, Mom. I’m in JAIL.”This is a wildly unrealistic, yet very entertaining domestic thriller/mystery. I have to mention that it’s unrealistic because, as a lawyer myself, I really couldn’t get past the premise of a wife defending her husband for murdering the woman he was cheating on her with. Girrrrrl, no. No one even mentions a conflict of interest until halfway through the book. So, if it’s a traditional legal thriller you’re looking for, this is not the book for you. However, once I decided to go with the premise, I found myself very entertained. There are some juicy suspects, good red herrings, and interesting and fun characters, not least of which is our heroine, Sarah — the county’s most famous female criminal defense attorney who has inexplicably decided to defend her sleazebag philandering husband.The excellent audiobook performances, narrating for both husband and wife, really enhanced my enjoyment of this book. While not super intellectual or heavy on the accurate legal thriller details, this is a fun and devious portrait of a marriage gone wrong. I was entertained. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.Thanks to NetGalley, the author, and Dreamscape Audio for the advance listening copy!",4
714,The Perfect Marriage,"This book had an ending that was totally unearned, and simply didn’t fit. A character who is written in the first person feeling surprise, anger, etc. it turns out was faking those things. That simply doesn’t work as you are supposedly inside that characters head. To work it would have to be in the third person.Also, no understanding of how the legal system or criminal justice system works. Murder cases take years to get to trial, and I think death penalty cases are automatically appealed.I think there are the bones of a good story here, but needs a lot more editing. This feels like an early draft.",2
715,The Perfect Marriage,"What did I just read? Wow! What a shocking Ending! I have seen this on so many IG posts that I knew I needed to get it! I have on my NetGalley You Shouldn't Have Come Here and cannot wait to read it from this talented author. Even though Gone Girl is used in so many analogies of talented writers, I feel she fits in this category of surprise! It is deserving of one of the bestselling thrillers!""His mistress is dead. His wife is his only hope."" That wife is Sarah Morgan, a successful attorney in D.C. She is representing her husband, Adam, in his defense of murdering his mistress. Not sure I could be in the same room with him, but she builds his case. Adam is a writer with not much luck in that area. Sarah bought him a lake house to get away in to help his writing. It was helping with more than his writing tool..... The Lake house becomes a place for his steamy and passionate affair with Kelly. She was found stabbed to death in their bed.With the evidence stacked against him, I was not expecting so many twists and turns. I finished in record time to make this a great ending to 2022!",5
716,The Perfect Marriage,"If you're looking for something plausible, realistic or have well developed characters(pick any one) might I suggest NOT this book. It is the exact opposite. I apologize in advance for the snarky review but this book deserves some snark….Quick Synopsis: Adam's mistress/girlfriend was found dead in his lake house and he is arrested for capital murder. Lucky for him his wife, Sarah, is a hot-shot criminal defense attorney. Conflict of interest you say? Nope not in this book apparently.What I liked:* This was a fast paced read but that's it in the likable area. And I think I only sort of liked it up until roughly the 30% mark if that.What I did NOT like:*The description of the characters for sure, so one dimensional. if I read ""doe - eyed"" one more time I was going to throw up. Each time Adam used that while he was in an intimate setting made me think of Bambi --- yes Bambi. Totally not cool. And Sarah was constantly described by the expensive shoes/outfits and perfectly coifed hair. Anne was the assistant that none of the higher up partners/lawyers could remember her name who idolized Sarah. Nothing new here*I'm not an expert in the legal field by any means but I'm thinking the head of Law Enforcement on the case shouldn’t be catering to the defense attorney. Much less making googly eyes at her. They were the most incompetent, unprofessional group of law enforcement ever! I didn't realize everyone and literally their mother was allowed to see interviews etc....*Eleanor's treatment of Adam: Cubbie-Bear - no just nope. And who makes a snack plate for their 30ish year old son right after he gets out on bail for his MURDER trial. And to add on to the snack plate she brings Lunchables, Gushers and Go-Gurt?*Adam - so much to write on this one but what really had me rolling my eyes was him wondering if something was going on with Sarah and the Sheriff. I personally think I would be worrying about the DEATH PENALTY over that. Especially since he isn't a saint (obviously). Then he gets irritated with Sarah for not returning his calls and he wonders why she would be too busy to call…ummm yeah maybe its that small murder case she is working on to save YOUR life.*Sarah - super pretentious, nasty ""fill in the blank"". However I'm guessing that is the route the author wanted to go after I got to the ending....*Speaking of ending - Around 70% it turned into a full-fledged three ring circus at the police station. Any small chance of plausibility this book had went right out the window - sigh! Everyone is too busy tackling, slapping, name calling or what-have-you that the door is unlocked and Adam just slips on out because he's going to solve this case, which obviously doesn't go well.Ok rant over! I apologize to anyone who sat thru my ranting review but this book totally deserved it.",2
717,The Perfect Marriage,"Ugh.I honestly don't know how this book is so highly rated. I had to speed read through parts of it just so I could finish it. I thought the premise was really interesting and wanted to know who the killer was, which was why I didn't DNF it. But man, I wish I had. The reveal and ending were not worth it at all. Those are hours of my life that I won't get back. But hey, at least that's one more book read for my reading challenge.Anyway. Where do I start? I did not like the writing style at all. So many unnecessary descriptions and metaphors. So many pointless things minutely explained. There wasn't a single likeable character in the whole book. Pretty much everything they did and the way they interacted with each other was exasperating or stupid. I was constantly shaking my head or rolling my eyes. The trial, which seems like it would be a pretty important part of the book, gets glossed over. We get the Defense's opening statement, then the verdict. How did the jury come to their verdict? The one time I wanted details about something in this book... Sigh. Nothing about this book was gripping or suspenseful. The ""twists"" were lame. The reveal was lame. The explanation of why and how the murder was committed was lame. The ending was lame. All of the characters were irritating and just ugh. The only good thing about this book is that it was in Kindle Unlimited, so I didn't waste my money on it. I won't be reading anything by this author again.",1
718,The Perfect Marriage,"0.5/5 stars--I don't think there are enough vitriolic words in my vocabulary for me to properly sum up how much I disliked this book.It wasn't the ending that got me. However stupidly it all played out, I didn't mind how it ended. It made no damn sense, of course, but what inThe Perfect Marriageactually did? Certainly not the way the law enforcement officers and attorneys acted. Certainly not the 'red herrings' the author included to try and throw us off the track. Which worked, but only because you couldn't have predicted her ending unless you were throwing out random guesses.I think what really ground my gears about this book is the fact that it felt so raw. And not in the sense of something that really gets at the core of an issue, more like raw as in undercooked. It's like she published her first draft. Her beta readers, agent, and editors really let her down. The sheer number of misplaced commas alone frustrated the shit out of me.And let's talk about Matthew. Every single one of the characters inThe Perfect Marriagewas a cardboard cutout, caricatures of stereotypes. I'm ALL for queer representation in books. I welcome it; I love it. However, I felt like the goal of adding Matthew in – who served no purpose whatsoever in the advancement of the plot – was to check a diversity box. And she wrote him in a way that was borderline offensive. Could he havebeenmore stereotypical?I'm still not entirely convinced that I read the same book as everyone else. Thank god I got my copy from the library, otherwise I might have sued Jeneva Rose for my money and for the dental bill I'm sure to get after how hard I ground my teeth while reading this mess.I won't read another one of her books. Her writing is so incredibly juvenile that it actually made me miss Colleen Hoover's style.I, resoundingly, do not recommendThe Perfect Marriage.",1
719,The Perfect Marriage,"When I was a teenager, me and my friends loved to watch bad horror movies. Reading the perfect marriage reminded me of the feeling I got. Adam was the half-crazed zombie with barely any brain-cells left. The cops felt like headless chicken running around in circles.I felt entertained though, just as I did when I laughed from the bad acting in those horror movies. I especially liked Adam`s strange behavior and the way the author portrayed his tought process. What I didn`t like was; That the police didn`t do its job when there clearly was other avenues to explore. That Sarah, Adam`s wife, became his lawyer despite that being a conflict of interest and that there only were some short sequences where this was questioned. It made more sense when I came to the end, but it still annoyed me nonetheless. The twist was good, and unlike some other psychological thrillers who have done the same, I felt like what happened earlier in the book fitted with the twist.",4
720,The Perfect Marriage,The Perfect Marriage grabbed my attention from the beginning. This story is so crazy. I was constantly trying to figure out if Adam was guilty or not. Adam is adamant that he had nothing to do with killing the mistress he loved. There are so many twists and turns throughout this book. I liked how Sarah’s personal conflict was brought up throughout the book along with the suspense. The Perfect Marriage is an excellent domestic thriller with so much drama and surprises.I listened to the audiobook narrated by Neil Hellegers and Teri Schnaubelt and loved the narration. They talked with so much emotion and were the perfect voices for Sarah and Adam.Thank you Dreamscape Media and NetGalley for the audiobook of The Perfect Marriage.Full Review:https://justreadingjess.wordpress.com...,4
721,The Perfect Marriage,"What a piece of garbage. I read a lot of psychological thrillers, and this one missed the mark on EVERY level. Absolutely unbelievable plot, one dimensional characters, insane plot holes, zero redeeming qualities. If I had purchased a physical copy instead of digital I would have thrown it in the trash to remove just one copy from the world.Update 12/13/23:I am utterly SHOCKED at the number of 4 and 5 star reviews. It leads me to believe that this was the very first book they have ever read that was supposed to be a psychological thriller, so they have no comparisons. To those readers, go get the Fourth Monkey trilogy and prepare to have your minds BLOWN. You can thank me later.",1

723,The Perfect Marriage,"I was pumped to read this because the reviews are so polarizing. I knew I was either going to love this with passion or hate it with fervor. I was going to feelsomething.I'll start with the good: the story was riveting. Unputdownable even. Very intriguing plot. Tightly written, short chapters, perfect pacing, the whole nine yards.I was already aware of an explosive twist ending which made it easier to identify. So I was missing that initial shock reaction that bumps thrillers up another star rating. Despite some holes, it was a good ending.What really bothered me was the absurd way the police investigation was written. It's like the author's research was to ask a group of 6 year olds how they would conduct a murder investigation and then says ""ok kiddos, let's go with that.""I rarely criticize police work in books because a) what the hell do I know and b) it's fiction after all. But the way this plays out is a crime against literature.I also hate how Adam was written. The super attractive, alpha, douchebag, dumb as rocks husband who falls in love instantly with every woman who enters his orbit. I was waiting for him to express his love to the fridge for simply existing and keeping his beer cold.Welp, at least I felt something. Cheers!",2
724,The Perfect Marriage,"3.5 starsThis review was first posted on Mystery and Suspense. Check it out for features, interviews, and reviews.https://www.mysteryandsuspense.com/th...Sarah and Adam Morgan are very much in love, but their decade-long marriage is experiencing a bit of strife.Sarah is doing well as a top defense attorney in Washington DC, but Adam - who was once a best-selling author - hasn't finished a novel in years. To spur his career, Adam convinced Sarah to buy a vacation home in Virginia, where he could write in a quiet atmosphere. Adam goes to Virginia for three or four days at a time..........while Sarah usually remains in Washington to work.Sarah and Adam's tenth anniversary is in a couple of days, and the couple plan to celebrate the occasion in their Virginia residence. Adam goes on ahead, but Sarah is held up by a trial and can't make it. So Adam spends a lusty night in the Virginia abode with beautiful Kelly Summers, a married woman he's been seeing for 18 months. Adam returns to Washington the next morning, while Kelly is still asleep in his bed.A few hours after Adam returns home, while Sarah is at work, Virginia sheriffs come knocking on the door.They say the housekeeper found Kelly Summers stabbed to death in the Morgans' Virginia house. Adam is a prime suspect, and he's promptly hauled off to Virginia, where he's questioned and arrested for murder.When Sarah learns of Adam's predicament - and his long-term affair - she's hurt, shocked and angry.Nevertheless, Sarah believes she's the only lawyer good enough to get Adam acquitted, so she takes on his defense. Adam insists on a speedy trial, and the proceedings are set to begin in two weeks, with the death penalty attached. (At this point I have to say the quickie police investigation and accelerated judicial proceedings stretch credulity to the breaking point, but I'm willing to grant author's license.)As part of her trial preparation Sarah searches for other suspects, to raise reasonable doubt with the jury.Moreover, Adam - who's granted bail and confined to his Virginia home with an ankle bracelet - launches an investigation of his own.The book alternates back and forth between Sarah and Adam's point of view, so we see what each of them thinks and does.As the story unfolds, Kelly's dubious past is revealed, and the secrets of other characters are exposed as well. The tension builds as one possible killer after another comes to light, and my suspicions leapt from person to person.The book has a rich array of secondary characters, including the Virginia sheriff who investigates Kelly's murder, and seems unsure of Adam's guilt;Kelly's cop husband, who's jealous and has a terrible temper;Adam's over-protective mother, who blames Sarah for her son's troubles;Sarah's sarcastic friend Matthew, who insults people with clever quips;Sarah's law partner Bob, who's envious of Sarah's success;the district attorney, who's good at his job;an aggressive reporter, who wants to interview Adam;Adam's greedy agent, who asks his client to write a tell-all; and more.If you like suspenseful thrillers filled with surprises, this is the book for you.You can follow my reviews athttps://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com",3
725,The Perfect Marriage,"What. did. I. just. read?This book made me so uncomfortable and yet I couldn’t put it down. I wanted to feel bad for Adam (I was almost positive he was innocent), but I just... couldn’t. He had no redeeming qualities. None. His behavior and attitude disgusted me and he made such unbelievably selfish and foolish choices. So while I didn’t hope for him to be found guilty, I couldn’t root for him either.I’m having a hard time figuring out how I feel about the ending. I liked the “whodunnit” aspect of the story but once I found out who the killer was, I had to go back and reread several parts. I had to make it add it up because when the story ended, I felt a little misled. I did briefly suspect this person... but I soon brushed off that suspicion because it didn’t make sense.After rereading a number of chapters through a new lens I did make a little more sense out of the reveal, but I think it’s asking a lot of the reader. Unless you can easily suspend your disbelief. There were a lot of red herrings.And that ending? Ugh I just don’t know.Did I like this book? Like I said, I couldn’t put it down. I liked her writing style. I liked the idea of the plot. But I don’t know if I actually liked the story. All I know is I feel icky after having read it.Don’t let that discourage you, though! In fact, PLEASE read it so I can discuss it with you. Because for all of the negatives I’ve said, I can’t stop thinking about it. So maybe it’s actually a good story? Help me out and read it and comment below, please!",3
726,The Perfect Marriage,"“The Perfect Marriage” by Jeneva Rose was truly a brilliant read. Her style of writing is fantastic as the characters, story, plot, twists, turns, and everything else in between were all great. You truly get pulled in as a reader as this mystery novel pushes the envelope for telling an incredible story that involves murder, infidelity, and all the consequences that come with it.From Sarah, Adam, the cops/lawyers involved, and all the events that transpired in law offices/courtrooms, this was such a wild ride. I truly had no idea how this would get all wrapped up since the tension was real as it kept me guessing until the very end. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin or spoil anything for you but I totally had no idea that this would have such a mind-blowing ending.The ending completely and utterly blew me away and instantly made me a reader of Rose because it was that crazy! I plan to read her previous and future work as my goodness, this was such an awesome read from beginning to end. I also enjoyed how the ending filled all the gaps for me by answering all the questions I had about things as I read to know what really happened when everything was going down.Overall, I give “The Perfect Marriage” by Jeneva Rose a perfect 5/5 as it checks all the boxes for me when it comes to a wonderful mystery novel that also falls into the thriller/suspense genre. This was quite the reading experience as I’d recommend this to anyone that also loves these genres. I’ll remember this one for many years to come!",5
727,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
728,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","You heard it here first, folks. I have found a newfavorite YA Thriller. I am stoked by how much I loved this!!For her Senior Capstone Project, Pippa Fitz-Amboi, an extraordinarily-focused high school girl, decides to solve a murder.Andie Bell, disappeared five years ago from Pippa's hometown; foul play was suspected.The police, and thus everyone else, believe Andie was murdered by her boyfriend at the time, Sal Singh, who subsequently disposed of the body.Their biggest piece of evidence, a purported confession Sal texted his parents, days after Andie disappeared. This confession was sent just prior to Sal's death, an apparent suicide.In spite of this, Pippa does not believe in Sal's guilt. Andie's body was never recovered and there is no real physical evidence linking him to her disappearance.Pippa is such a great character. She's an overachiever, who works tirelessly towards achieving her goals.You can tell, once she sets her sights on something, she will not give up and that's exactly how she tackles her Senior project.I think one of the things that connected me so much to this story was Pippa. I found her super relatable and loved reading from her perspective.She ends up befriending Sal's younger brother, Ravi. That additional commitment to him, and clearing Sal's name, makes Pippa even more steadfast; in spite of very real danger.Additionally, the format of this was creative and engaging. The use of mixed media sources, including the transcripts for the interviews from Pippa's investigation, and a present day narrative, made me feel like I was a part of the action.As Pippa is evaluating what she has learned along the way, she recaps things, as you actually would if you were working on this type of project; including a running list of current suspects tracked on her murder-board.The stakes were high and there were times Pippa was legitimately in very real danger. Through it all, she stayed true to herself and fought for justice for Andie and Sal.I loved this so much, as I said. I could go on for many more paragraphs of all the positive attributes of this story, but don't just take my word for it, PICK THIS UP!!!If you love it even half as much as I did, you're in for a good time! Well done by Holly Jackson. I am so excited to get more mysteries from her!!!",5
729,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","""Who do you think I am, an amateur?""Move aside, Nancy Drew! There's a new teen detective in town. And she won't rest until she's unearthed all your secrets and gotten to the bottom of a mystery that has long held her town captive.Pip never truly believed what all of Fairview has accepted: that Sal Singh murdered his beautiful and popular girlfriend Andie Bell and then killed himself. Five years later, Pip is a senior in high school, and decides for her final project that she's going to find out once and for all what really happened that night.I'm always in the mood for a good whodunnit. Give me a small group of suspects, everyone hiding secrets, more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and red herrings galore, and I'm in heaven. I loved putting on my detective cap and puzzling out the clues alongside Pip as she investigates and solves this mystery.For me, in order for a mystery to be successful, it has to be so riveting that there is no room for me to think. Once my mind gets going, it has this annoying habit of supplying me with random unsolicited guesses, some of which inevitably turn out to be right, and ruining the surprises. So it's best if I'm so taken with the story that I'm only surfacing to turn the pages as fast as I can. And this story was exactly that.I grew up on Nancy Drew, and have been looking for an older version of that for as long as I've outgrown it. And how wonderful that this story turned out to be all that I've been looking for and more. Pip is clever, spunky, and fearless, the perfect teen detective staring down secrets and murderers. And the fact that this is a series means I won't have to say goodbye to her just yet.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#2.Good Girl, Bad Blood#3.As Good As Dead~~~~~~~~~~~~",4

I cannot resist a good mystery, and am always on the hunt for the next ""it"" book in the genre. I'm a busy mom of two, so it is rare for me to find a book so special that I can finish it in two sittings, but that's exactly what I found withA Good Girl's Guide to Murder.Pippa Fitz-Amobi is a true crime loving teen who aspires to become a top-notch journalist one day. So naturally, she decides to focus her senior capstone project on her small town's most buzz-worthy, unsolved crime: the murder of Andie Bell. What begins as a simple proposal quickly turns into an in-depth investigation full of unexpected twists and turns. After teaming up with the alleged murderer's brother, the pair spiral into a web of danger and obsession, and quickly wonder if they've gotten themselves in too deep.This debut reads as if you are investigating alongside the main characters, and fans of true crime podcasts will rejoice in the multimedia formatting that so wittily engages the reader from beginning to end.

737,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","Rating: 1 star.Genuinely asking myself why I read this. This book had it all - bad writing, a completely unrealistic plot, white savior trope, ""I'm not like other girls"", and probably the most annoying main character I have ever read about.For some reason, this teenager is allowed to start a massive murder investigation, where every possible witness tells her everything without her having to work for it, and - of course - she ends up doing what the police couldn't. The whole premise was just so unrealistic and unbelievable that I was annoyed from the very first page.The mystery itself was also barely a mystery at all, the pacing was off, things made no sense and everything was terribly convenient. Pip kept making random decisions and suspect basically everyone until she finally guessed the right person. At that point in the book, I was just counting down how many pages I still had to suffer through.Pip had no personality traits aside from her constant need to save everyone because she was such a good person and better than everyone else, which the reader was reminded of every second page. It's never explained why any of these people talk to Pip and basically tell her their entire life stories, or even why she cares enough to launch this entire investigation. Her character has no development and at the end of the novel, she's still exactly as annoying as she was on the very first page.I wish I hadn't read this, it clearly wasn't for me and a massive waste of time.",1

741,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","Well, it appears, I've been reading YA mysteries all wrong these past years. Evidently, I should not expect plausibility, believability, character development or strong motivations in these books, like I do when reading adult mysteries. No wonder there is only ONE teen mystery that I think is good, and actual teens don't even like reading it, from what I hear. (It'sSadiein case you were wondering).A Good Girl's Guide to Murderstarts off as a Serial rip-off, with upstanding Pippa swooping in Sarah Koenig-like to clear the name of a poor brown guy accused of the murder of a popular girl whose body remains missing. You see, it's only Pippa who believes in Sal's innocence, and she will save the day, because she is a GOOD GIRL and Sal was once nice to her years ago! I was already annoyed at that point.However, from there this story devolves into a sleuthing adventure where Pippa manages to have every Tom, Dick and Harry confess all their misdoings to her, because PIPPA IS WRITING A SCHOOL PAPER ABOUT THE MURDER. She catphishes people, breaks into houses, blackmails drug dealers, discovers 5-year old evidence in plain view, because she is just so much better than the police at everything. I can understand why police wouldn't care to pursue a case of aWho Drew The D!cks or The Turd Bulrglarvariety, but a suicide and a presumed murder? And the victim is still missing and nobody but Pippa cares? Have you heard of Natalie Halloway? She disappeared 15 years ago, and she is still on TV. The whole investigation was one giant eyeroll for me.Anyway, to put it short, this book has nothing that I look for in a mystery. I am not reading any more YA mysteries if suspending disbelief entirely is the main requirement to get through them. I am just going to stick with Courtney Summers from now on. Thankfully she has another one coming out next year, and it's about cults!",2

But Pippa knows Sal is innocent, so she decides to find out what happened five years ago and whoreally killedAndie Bell.Pippa discovers that Andie had many secrets, that she was not the beautiful and tragic victim that the people of Little Kilton martyred and idolised, branding Sal Singh a murderer and a monster, treating his family very badly for it. In addition, Little Kilton holds even more secrets that intrigue Pip and make her want to keep digging to solve the mystery.Writing.I don't think I remember reading a book like this, with diary-like entries speaking in first person and then in third person. It was a bit strange, if I'm honest, and it took me a bit longer to adjust. However, it was an easy read in some respects. And, I don't know if it's because of the difference between British and American English, but there were phrases that I had to look up because I didn't understand them, lmao.Plot.The plot kept me glued in my seat, not wanting to put my phone down, wanting to know what would happen next. I mention that I was late with this book because college is eating me alive, though I made time to keep reading because I was consumed with thoughts of not knowing what would happen, who the killer would be and if Pip was going to find out. There are a lot of plot twists that I wasn't expecting and a lot of things that made my brain almost melt from thinking about it so much.Pacing.It was a quick and light read, and I take back that I was late because of college: I would have finished it sooner if it weren't for homework. It's not that complicated to understand and the pages turn very quickly.Characters.Pip is a good girl, addicted to homework and determined to solve the Andie Bell case and prove that Sal Singh is innocent at all costs. So eager is she to find out what really happened, that she finds herself lying to others so that they won't worry about her and try to stop her from abandoning her project.Ravi is the younger brother of Sal Singh. He has been the target of criticism, and is known as the brother of Andie Bell's killer. Ravi knows his brother is innocent, and when Pip shows up at his door asking him a few questions, he thinks it's a joke. And soon, Ravi becomes Pip's partner in crime, both looking for answers about his brother's sudden death and his innocence in the case. Ravi is a beautiful little baby, don't touch him I want to take care of him.Also, Ravi: marry me.Andie was a bitch and it doesn't surprise me much that bad things happened to her. Everyone held her in such high regard, believing she was a good girl whose boyfriend murdered her. Andie ruined several people's lives, and although I thought I would feel bad that she had died, I didn't really. When you find out the truth about Andie Bell, what she did and didn't do, you don't feel any empathy for her.Cara is Pip's best friend, her older sister is Naomi, who was in turn Sal's best friend and who also keeps a big secret that makes Pip dig very closely into her and her life, including her family.(Bonus and unnecessary fact:Cara translates from Spanish to English as: 'face' and 'expensive'.Unnecessary examples:Sucaraes hermosa= her face is beautiful. La camisa escara= the shirt is expensive.) Follow me for more unnecessary Spanish classes, they are free of charge.Pip's family is ok. They're the typical caring and normal family. Tho I loved Vic's jokes, jsjsjs he laughing at his own jokes (just as Ravi) is totally me.Max Hastings can die and I wouldn't care for him. He deserves the shit going on in his life. He's a dick and you can easily see it. Please, go fuck yourself, you fucking bastard. 🥰🥰🥰⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️oK, PEOPLE, SPOILER SECTION. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️Tho I loved this book, I really enjoyed and liked it a lot, there were many ??? things that left me with a bitter taste on my mouth.First of all, Pip felt a little bit dry and typical. She's a good girl who starts to lie for her project and she doesn't feel the same anymore. I mean, idk, I can't put it into words, I just hope she felt morerealand not flat.Second, how quick all of the possible suspects told Pip the truth, when they lied to the police or omitted information. I found it quite unbelievable and a little bit ilogic. Also, Mr. Ward confessed really quick and it felt dry... I don't quite know how to explain it, but I was expecting more. Becca Bell also confessed really quick, and spilled her secrets out as she were talking about the weather, which also felt a little bit bitter.aND THE FINAL STRAW: BARNEY. NO. NO. NO. NOT MY BABY BARNEY. HE WAS AN ANGEL AND I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER HIM WITH LOVE. LEANNE CRYING OVER THE CHRISTMAS' VIDEO OF BARNEY GIVING EVERYONE A SHOE BROKE ME DOWN. I WILL NEVER FORGIVE THIS!!!⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️End of the spoiler section⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️In summary, I really liked this book, was a quick reading and many plots got me hanging of the cliff. This is a ""you must read"" book.My mood during the last chapters:",5
743,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","3.5 starsWas it enjoyable?YesIs it binge worthy?YepWas I amazed?No, not reallyNow now, before anyone gets triggered.. Here me out I got my reasons 🫣So I had a lot of fun reading it, the mystery surrounding Angie and Sal was really awesome. Pip and Ravi are likable characters and with intriguing personalities. The amount of work Pip put in to unravel the mystery was commendable and it's all for a school project 😅It's awell written and extremely well thought out book,no doubt, so kudos to the author there. Also the way she exposed racism via characters like Stanley is something I really liked. Let's be honest, people like him still exist. That was the only part in the book where the author was realistic...Cmon you expect me to believe a school girl solved this murder case when the big guys police, detectives can't do shit. I get there can be some sort of corruption involved in cases but no way a school kid is solving a murder that complicated without the consistent assistance of someone with experience. I don't care how intelligent Pip was, it's justextremely unrealistic.Also, it was kind of a bummer that Ravi didn't get that much of time in the book. I wanted to see him involved more often.Don't even get me started on the dog. Thelast 100 pages were really wild.So much happened, so many exposed and new questions arising. Am keen on starting with the next book already.It's definitely worth checking out but it's not anything special. Maybe the expectations got to me but I would suggest to anyone who reads this for the first time- go in with lowered expectations. I personally believe thatFive Survivewas the better book.~•~•~Y'all.. Am gonna do it🤞 Really hope it's worth the hype",3
744,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","this story is giving off such strong ‘serial’ vibes that i can only imagine how amazing listening to the audiobook version would have been.a re-investigation of a cold case, including detailed diagrams and evidence files, with a really interesting mystery and suspects - what more could you want? this is every true crime enthusiasts dream story.the one thing preventing me from giving this five stars is the same thing i tend to find obnoxious about most YA mystery/thrillers - the need to include every crime imaginable. this murder revolves arounddrugs, rape, pedophilia, underaged drinking, cyberbullying, child abuse, vehicular assault,and a lot more. by the end of the story, its just too farfetched to be realistically believable. such a shame.but overall, this story is solidly entertaining, one that i would have absolutely no problem recommending to people. now excuse me while i go redownload the entire first season of ‘serial’ to listen to again.↠4 stars",4
745,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","OMG QUÉ WHAT WOW.Tenía ganas de leer este libro desde hacía tiempo. No es que hubiera leído muchas reseñas positivas ni nada por el estilo, perome daba esa sensación misteriosa que algunos libros te dan y sabes que necesitas leerlo y que te va a gustar.Sabéis a lo que me refiero, ¿no?EnAsesinato para principiantestenemos una trama que sinceramente me ha sorprendido muy positivamente.Losthrillersjuveniles de este estilo, a lo Natasha Preston o incluso Sara Shepard, suelen quedarse a veces un poco en la superficie de todo. Bueno, quizá no es la superficie, pero sí queme suele faltar un poco que me construyan mejor todo. Y es que Holly Jackson no escatima en detalles.A ver,el libro te agarra desde el primer momento.Yo normalmente leo el primer capítulo de un libro para decidir si va a ser mi próxima lectura o no, y en este caso es que llevaba página y media y dije pOR DIOS, SÍ, ESTO TIENE QUE SER MÍO.El estilo de la autora hace que te introduzcas de lleno en la historia, y lo mejor de todo, es que no es solo unthriller.Para que un libro de estas características funcione, o por lo menos para mí es esencial, tiene que tener una buena protagonista con la que conecte, entienda y quiera luchar por ella. Pip es así.La construcción del personaje no es algo accesorio, al contrario. Holly Jackson se centra bastante en tener una protagonista muy definida, conociendo detalles de su vida privada, relaciones con amigos y demás.No hace que el ritmo del libro bajey no hace tampoco que te impacientes para descubrir qué está pasando en el pueblo. La manera en la que Jackson maneja el espacio entre escenas me ha gustado mucho.No es muy normal para mí ponerle 5 estrellas a un libro de este género. No sé por qué, la verdad, peropuedo recordar pocas ocasiones donde unthrillerme haya volado la cabeza tantísimo.Pero es que enAsesinato para principiantestenemosuna historia que está perfectamente hilada, que se desarrolla lentamente pero con decenas de giros, y que te atrapa cada vez más porque se va convirtiendo en una locura cada vez más increíble.De hecho, le han visto el increíble potencial que tiene y los derechos audiovisuales han sido comprados. Esperemos que la cosa fluya y tengamos a Pippa y Ravi en la gran (o pequeña) pantalla, porque de verdad,este libro es increíble.Tenemos toda la trama de misterio, sobre qué pasó con Addie Bell y Sal Singh, cuyas averiguaciones van poniéndote los pelos de punta cada vez más.Los métodos para descubrir mentiras o verdades a medias de Pip son de aplaudir, porque es una chica muy inteligente y que no le tiene miedo a nada: tan solo persigue la verdad y la justicia.Una de mis cosas favoritas del libro es lowokeque es la autora.Pippa tiene un padrastro -al que llama padre- de origen nigeriano, su nuevo mejor amigo es indio y una de sus amigas es lesbiana. Y dirás: “¡pero la protagonista sigue siendo blanca! ¡Es una privilegiada!” Y así es. Y, de hecho, es tan así que hasta ella misma lo dice.Hay situaciones de racismo en el libro en las que Pippa habla sobre tener privilegios por ser blanca, sobre cómo puede tener actitudes racistas pese a haberse criado con un padre negro…Me ha encantado que en un libro de misterio aparentemente solo de eso, se debatan o comenten este tipo de temas sociales.También se habla de machismo, abusos sexuales…En general, es un libro con temas de actualidad, y quizá la excusa para tratarlos es el misterio. (Aunque tampoco es que la crítica sea una pieza central, no nos confundamos.)Sin embargo,con lo que más me quedo deAsesinato para principianteses con la pedazo de trama de Holly Jackson y cómo está organizada. Os prometo que es increíble la cantidad de capas que tiene la historia, la cantidad de personajes relacionados… Es que sigo sin palabras.Qué maravilla.Ahora solo queda esperar a ver si traen el segundo pronto a España, porque si no…Amazon, is that you?(También os digo, que me da mucha rabia hacer la reseña sin spoilers. Se me queda corta comparada con todo lo que quiero hablar, pero no quiero joderos la experiencia. Confiad en mí cuando os digo que os va a flipar este libro.)Tw: tramas sobre suicidio, asesinatos, violaciones, abusos sexuales, pedofilia, muerte de animales, consumo de drogas y alcoholismo.",5

747,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","Hoy tengo ganas de escribir en GR, así que daré mi breve opinión de este libro.¡La verdad es que me gustó bastante! Ustedes saben que llevo tiempo interesada en leer thrillers y este me lo habían recomendado un montón, luego vi las reseñas y terminé por convencerme, ¡no me arrepiento!Pippa, la protagonista, es un ser fácil de querer, jajaja. Sí siento que a veces era demasiado impulsiva y no medía las consecuencias de sus actos, pero aún así solo quería que todo le saliera bien. No sé, como protagonista me pareció dinámica y divertida y carismática, en ningún momento me cansé de seguirla en su investigación :). DIGO, sí llegué a pensar que estaba llevando las cosas muy lejos, pero se me hizo un personaje tan bien construido, que sus acciones tenían sentido (tipo de: ""¡eso es tan Pippa!"").AWWW, además no me esperaba al interés amoroso y, aunque la historia no se centra para nada en el romance, se me hizo una parejita súper bonita AND I WAS ROOTING FOR THEM.El elemento principal de la historia es el misterio y está súper bien llevado. El libro te atrapa desde el primer momento y es imposible de soltar. Además, a mí me pareció poco predecible. Teníamos a varios sospechosos y TODOS PODÍAN SER CULPABLES. Todos tenían sus razones muy fuertes. ¿Y adivinen qué? Obviamente no le atiné, jajajaja.Eso sí, no sé si continuar con la trilogía porque creo que este libro terminó muy bien así. Pero quién sabe, no estoy cerrada a las posibilidades.",4
748,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","This is a teenage detective novel with Nancy Drew vibes and an exciting plot that will be the best way to help you break a reading slump.Holly Jackson rose up to the expectations and managed to pull out a thriller that is exciting to read.Police found out that schoolgirl Andie Bell was murdered by Sal Singh five years ago, and the case is closed now. But Pippa Fitz-Amobi thinks that Sal is not the killer. She chooses this case as the topic for her final year, Senior Capstone Project. She is trying to find the mystery behind Andie Bell's case. Was Sal the real killer? If not, is Pippa's life in danger? Will the killer try to hurt Pippa so that she won't be able to solve the case? Holly Jackson will answer all these questions through this book.What I learned from this book1) What is hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia?This is an interesting new word I learned from this book. Its meaning is fear of long words.“Pip knew a great many things; she knew thathippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobiawas the technical term for the fear of long words.”2) What happens to all the missing people?The author shares some interesting statistics related to the missing people in this book. This will help us to know what actually happens to the missing people.“I found these statistics: 80% of missing people are found in the first twenty-four hours. 97% are found in the first week, and 99% of cases are resolved in the first year. That leaves just 1%. 1% of people who disappear are never found. And just 0.25% of all missing persons cases have a fatal outcome.""3) What is toxic productivity, and how can it hurt our life?Few of my friends and patients are obsessed with watching productivity videos on YouTube. Productivity is always good in our life. But when it reaches such a level that we always try to be productive in all areas of life, it might reach toxic levels. Are the online productivity gurus hurting people's lives instead of helping them? This serious question can only be answered after more profound research and understanding.The author indirectly mentions toxic productivity in a couple of areas in this book.“What's wrong with me? ... I might seem like the ideal student: homework always in early, every extra credit and extracurricular I can get my hands on, the good girl and the high achiever. But I realized something just now: it's not ambition, not entirely. It's fear. Because I don't know who I am when I'm not working, when I'm not focused on or totally consumed by a task. Who am I between the projects and the assignments, when there's nothing to do? I haven't found her yet and it scares me.""“Your efficiency offends me.”My favourite three lines from this book“Half less of a bad thing meant there was room for half good.”“The people you love weren’t algebra: to be calculated, subtracted, or held at arm’s length across a decimal point.”""But sometimes remembering isn't for yourself, sometimes you do it just to make someone else smile. Those lies were allowed.""What could have been better?If you are someone who attended Med School, you will know how some patients try to avoid Med School students saying that they are not Doctors even after knowing they will be Doctors in a couple of years.If we look at the world from the angle of the people I mentioned above, it will be difficult to believe that a teenager is going for an important murder investigation like this, and almost every person connected to it treating her like a real grown-up police officer/ detective and fully cooperating with her and telling her everything they know. It, in fact, looks totally unrealistic from any practical human being's point of view.Rating3.5/5This is a real page-turner with many twists that will satisfy most of the readers.—————————————————————————You can also follow me onInstagram ID - Dasfill|YouTube Channel ID - Dasfill|YouTube Health Channel ID - Dasfill - Health|YouTube Malayalam Channel ID - Dasfill - Malayalam|Threads ID - Dasfill|Twitter ID - Dasfill1|Snapchat ID - Dasfill|Facebook ID - Dasfill|TikTok ID - Dasfill1",4

751,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","SMART GIRLS RULE!A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder is a smart YA mystery/thriller about a 17-year-old girl who investigates a murder that rocked her small town 5 years ago.Pippa “Pip” Fitz- Amobbi to conduct her Senior Capstone project on the disappearance of Andie Bell, a high school senior who was presumed to be murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh. Shortly after Andie went missing, Sal killed himself and confessed to her murder. But Andie’s body was never found. Convicted by the town and the press, Sal’s name is permanently marred and his family is viewed as the town pariahs. To determine if Sal really was guilty, Pip uses her intelligence and quick wit, to examine multiple angles and threads that were overlooked by the police. This is not a conventional class project, and while it seems a little over the top in the beginning, Pip’s character approaches it in a way that makes sense.“If a villain can be made, then he can be unmade.”Pip makes for a great heroine. She is intelligent and strong and has the knack for seeing things that others ignore. A self-identified nerd, you can’t help but root for her. She also is very much 17 years old and a little naive to the ways of the world. I would compare her to a softer version of Veronica Mars.I was a little apprehensive from the start because I am not a huge fan of Young Adult novels, but this one worked for me. In the beginning, I was constantly thinking “what’s a 17 year old going to find that the police did not.” However, once it became clear that there were gaps in the police investigation that Pip was able to see, I was sold. Also, Pip’s approach to solving the case and getting people to talk about Andie and Sal, etc. helped solidify that this book was the real deal and not just about a kid who happens to luck into solving a crime. Jackson takes a multimodal approach to share Pip’s investigation; the narrative switches from the third person to interview recordings to pages in a diary to email exchanges, which kept it interesting and added an element of realism.While I was a little hesitant to read this, I was so glad I did. I quickly became immersed in the narrative, wound up loving Pip’s character, and enjoyed the plot--I figured out the murderer very early on, but there were a few twists that threw me for a loop.I look forward to seeing where Pip’s crime-solving skills lead her in the next book in the series!",4
752,"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1)","This was so much fun ahhhhThis book was so good! Definitely one of the best YA thrillers I've ever read. Our main character Pippa is investigating a murder and suicide in her small town that happened a few years ago. Andie Bell, the popular girl in the town was murdered, everyone assumed it was her boyfriend Sal who did it and then a few days later he killed himself. But the story has always seemed a little fishy so she wants to look into it more.This book was so much fun, the way it was told in interview clips and phone calls was really cool.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE AUDIOBOOKThe audiobook is fantastic, it has a full cast of narrators and it actually sounds like real phone calls and it's just so well done. I love our main character Pippa, she's so clever and smart and she's so mature for her age.

(Hi, Yun!) The story was very enjoyable and I liked that there were at least eleven people voicing the characters. Pippa's detailed notes and descriptions of her investigations seemed like the way I'd handle something such as this research for a school project. The story is darker than I expected it to be but now that I've looked at the reviews of the next two books in the series, I see that things are going to get even darker.Pippa is a top notch student, dedicated to her studies, and has stayed very much on the ""good girl"" side of things when the book starts. I suspect that the decisions that Pippa makes in this story may have moved her away from her ""good girl"" side to someone who may dwell in a gray area from here on out. Or maybe she even goes to the dark side?

757,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"This might be my favorite book this year, and will also be one of the best books I’ve ever read. Why did I love it so much?Let’s start with the writing. Every page was impressive. The prose was spot-on and there were so many sentences I wanted to underline or reread. The dialogues were saturated with meaning and humor. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the writing style.Then we have the characters. The author has a real gift when it comes to creating real, complex characters. She crafted unique personalities where their choices fitted perfectly with their traits. Some authors struggles with getting into the head of characters, but this author managed to bring new people into my life and I got fond of them. I didn’t want to say goodbye to them.In addition to the humans, there was the most original and wonderful POV; the bright octopus. It was a delight to read those chapters. I actually cried after reading about the last thing he did for Tova and she for him. How many authors are able to make you cry because of an octopus?The plot was intricate and well-thought through. I was invested from the first to last page and found myself saying ‘No’ in horror when some of the misunderstandings threatened the happiness of my new fictional best friends. Sometimes I thought; why didn’t you realize that? But then the author described why based on the personality and history of the character and it made me realize how easily we can misjudge and act in a way that potentially harms us.I loved the ending although it was hard to say goodbye. I could have wandered around in their universe forever.",5
758,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"I wrongread the crap out of this one. I totally get why this has been such a hit for others. I mean, the world is shit and fiction is a great place to turn when you need something hopeful. I’ve fallen victim to the right time/right place heartstring-tugger a time or twelve myself. (See A Man Called Ove, The House in the Cerulean Sea, The Guncle, etc.) And like everyone else, I loved Marcellus and heard the “Sad Cat Diary” narrator each time he voiced a chapter that really brought a smile to my face . . . .But oh my god how did y’all tolerate Cameron? Freaking spoiled manbaby! So sorry your momma was a deadbeat and ditched you as a kid, but it’s not like you got dumped into the foster care system to rot. No, you were left with an aunt who not only loved you but coddled your ass into your dang 30s. Grow up, butthole! I broke my normal routine and poked around a few reviews since everyone but me loved this and I’ve noticed most don’t even mention him at all – despite him being a main character in the story. Maybe you all were simply able to ignore him???? I love a loveable loser, but this dude was a user and no redemption arc could make me like him.2.5 Stars",2
759,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"Marcellus the octopus!!! *heart eyes forever*I don’t read a lot of literary fiction, but I was utterly charmed by this book. It was so creative and full of heart.

762,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"***MAY -- TODAY SHOW BOOK CLUB BOOK*****This is a review of the audiobook of this novelCAN A HUMAN AND A GIANT PACIFIC OCTOPUS COMMUNICATE?The answer in this debut novel is most definitely YES!!!Tova is recently widowed and is working as a cleaning lady at the Sowell Bay Aquarium. Tova has always felt that keeping busy was the best way to cope with the things that life throws at you. She also knows a lot about loss, her son Eric aged 18, disappeared 30 years ago, after taking out a boat on Puget sound.Marcellus is a 60 lb Giant Pacific Octopus who has been living in the Aquarium for several years. He was a rescue but Marcellus considers himself a captive and dreams of returning to the sea. He is also highly intelligent and quite adept at escaping his tank when he wants to roam about!Cameron is a young man who has come to town looking for the father he never knew. His mother left when he was young and he was raised by his aunt.The story is told from the point of view of these three characters.WHAT I LOVED ABOUT THIS AUDIOBOOK:The star of this novel is definitely Marcellus and I enjoyed his POV the most!The narrators were absolutely great and the voice of Marcellus is just as I expected it would be, he is intelligent, a bit of a grouch but has formed a bond with Tova.The setting of Puget sound is described in all of it’s splendor, I could easily picture the glistening blue waters and almost smell the salt in the air!While fanciful, this story still had me engaged throughout. The novel is nicely paced and I was never bored.After listening to this book and loving it, I of course had to Google The Giant Pacific Octopus. I found that it is indeed extremely intelligent and there are many articles about them solving puzzles, escaping from enclosures, etc. You will enjoy learning more about them if you liked this novel!While the story is somewhat predictable it was still fun to listen to how these two humans and one octopus would solve the mystery of Tova’s missing son.If you believe that animals can bring comfort and happiness to a person’s life and can help you heal from life's tragedies, you will love this book!! It is quirky and fun but there are also some serious issues described.I received this audiobook from the publisher through NetGalley and Harper Audio. It was my pleasure to listen to and review this wonderful story!Publication date is May 3, 2022",5
763,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"The book was incredibly slow and very mundane at times. More than halfway through nothing significant had happened. There were a few chapters that were completely pointless and didn't contribute to the story in any way.The author failed to give enough reasons for me to care about any of the characters. They all felt predictable and halfhearted.Cameron's character was just the regular annoying, whiny kind of loser who blames everybody else for his ""hard"" life. We are constantly reminded how smart he is and yet the only way his smarts present themselves is through some random trivia. A 30 year old man who was raised by an aunt who made sure he had a roof over his head, rather than just being thrown into the system, who still blames his mother for all of his life choices and mistakes, is not someone I can feel sorry for. Grow up and get your act together ffs.Marcellus was the only thing that kept the whole book together and he should have been given more space in it. I would have gladly read an entire book told only from his perspective.",2
764,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"4.5⭐️Seventy-year-old Tova Sullivan works the nightshift as a cleaner at Sowell Bay Aquarium. She lives alone, recently widowed and her eighteen-year-old son having disappeared almost thirty years ago. Though financially stable, Tova believes in keeping herself occupied and enjoys her work and the company of the aquatic life in the aquarium, among whom is Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus, who was taken in as a rescue and at the beginning of the novel is on Day 1299 of his four-year (1460 day) life span. His observations and ruminations on human beings (which are shared in the first person in snippets throughout the narrative) are laced with humor (with a touch of snark) and wisdom. He is after all a ‘remarkably bright creature’ who also happens to venture out of his tank at nighttime, never exceeding the eighteen minutes beyond which would result in “consequences” as he cannot survive longer than that outside his tank. On one of his nocturnal adventures, Tova ends up saving him from harm and they form a special bond. Though Tova has a supportive group of friends, she is concerned about not having anyone to look after her in her advanced age and begins to consider the option of selling her home and moving into an upscale retirement facility. As the story progresses we also meet thirty-year-old Cameron Cassmore who travels to Sowell Bay, Washington from Modesto, California in search of information about his family connections. Abandoned by his mother as a child and raised by his aunt, he has recently become aware of possible family connections that lead him to Sowell Bay. He hasn’t done much with his life till now, is unable to hold a steady job and has been recently dumped by his girlfriend who was fed up with his lack of initiative and whimsical nature. Cameron, Tova and Marcellus connect when he starts working at the aquarium and what follows is a deeply moving story of friendship, community, family, grief and moving on.The author’s portrayal of a close-knit small-town community and sensitive depiction of issues such as loss, grief, loneliness and aging will touch your heart. Though the plot is somewhat predictable, the story is very well told and nowhere in the narrative do you lose interest or experience boredom. Marcellus is adorable and is a reminder of how precious our animal friends are to us especially in moments of loneliness and sorrow. The story also makes you ponder over the plight of animals in captivity. Though none of the animals in this story were harmed or ill-treated, you cannot help but feel sympathy for Marcellus when he feels imprisoned within the glass walls of the aquarium and misses his natural habitat.Set in the beautiful Pacific Northwest, with a lively cast of characters (human and cephalopod), engaging and well-paced narrative and a perfect combination of emotion, humor, wit and wisdom (suspend disbelief and you will enjoy the story!), Shelby Van Pelt’s Remarkably Bright Creatures is a beautiful story that will tug at your heartstrings and leave you with a lump in your throat and a smile on your face.I thank the author and publisher for providing a DRC of this wonderful book via Edelweiss+.

765,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van PeltNarrated by Marin Ireland and Michael UrieSeventy year old Tova Sullivan loves her job working the night shift at the Sowell Bay Aquarium. Doing this job helps her with the grief of losing her husband. There is another grief that has been with her for many decades, since her eighteen year old son died, his body never found.Tova loves cleaning the floors, windows, tanks, and the seal statue that was a favorite of her son when he was little. For Tova, this job is a life saver, a place for her to be, a place she is needed, welcomed, and cherished by the aquarium manager. And then something very special happens! Tova meets curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus living at the aquarium. She already knew Marcellus, just as she knew all the other aquarium creatures but she never KNEW him before she and Marcellus meet face to face in an amazing way. Thus begins a lifelong friendship between Tova and Marcellus. Lifelong considering the short length of life that Marcellus has left since he is at the end of his four year lifespan.There is another important person in this story and it's thirty year old Cameron Cassmore, a man who has never really grown up or found his place in life. He's never met his father and his mother abandoned him when he was nine. Cameron has a lot of growing up to do, having never held a job that he wasn't fired from, having never learned to pick up his own socks, and having never been someone anyone could rely on. But he's in Sowell Bay now, on the prowl to find out the secrets to his past, hoping what he finds will pay off, if possible.I loved this story, the people, Marcellus, and gray Cat. The audiobook narration could not be better. Marin Ireland does her usual wonderful job while Michael Urie IS Marcellus. He's now a new favorite narrator of mine. I avoid animal stories because I usually can't handle things happening to animals but this is a story about giving life to both animals and humans and that giving makes future loss bearable. Even if we can't keep something forever, we don't want to miss the chance of the time we can spend with those we can love and cherish.Pub May 3, 2022 by HarperAudio",5
766,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"Incredible!! 5+ stars and highly recommend!I listened to Shelby Van Pelt's book,Remarkably Bright Creatures, on audiobook and I highly recommend listening to the book. Michael Urie does a phenomenal job as Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus who is smarter than humans and is an escape artist at night from his tank (captivity) at Sowell Bay Aquarium. Marin Ireland narrates other characters and has an amazing Scottish brogue for the character of Ethan.Like other book reviewers, I was skeptical about a book regarding an octopus but I was immediately captivated. Similar to other reviewers, I researched octopus information and they are considered the most intelligent of all invertebrates and they can radically alter their body shape to squeeze through small gaps.The character development, dialogue, and drama of Tova, Cameron, Ethan, and Avery are terrific. Van Pelt does an amazing job on dealing with tough topics like death, loss, and grief as well as more positive issues of relationships, friendship, and interconnectedness.Highly recommend!",5
767,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"5 just go with it starsThere have been lots of books between dogs and cats forming impressive bonds with humans. But this is the first that involves an octopus and a human. Marcellus is a giant Pacific octopus. And he’s nearing the end of his expected life span. Tova is the seventy year old woman that cleans the aquarium where Marcellus is a prisoner, as he sees it. She’s a widow and her 18 year old son went missing decades earlier.I had enjoyed watching My Octopus Teacher on Netflix earlier this year. And Van Pelt does an equally good job of showing the reader how smart octopuses are.The story weaves in other characters - a thirty year old still trying to find his footing and also the father he never knew, a transplanted Scot who runs the local deli and store. I found myself drawn to each and every one of them. This is a lovely heartwarming story. It deals with growing old alone, grief, growing up belatedly. It grabbed my heart. I loved the magic realism of this story.Both narrators do a great job. This made for a delightful audio experience. Michael Urle was superb as Marcellus. Marin Ireland always does a great job and this time is no exception.",5
768,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"I finished this book with a bittersweet feeling and a smile. How important is that? For me it's priceless. How rare was that for this reader? Pretty darn rare. Maybe I've been reading the wrong books.Three wonderful characters and one giant octopus. Tova. Cameron, Ethan, and Marcellus. All searching for something and as I listened I so wanted them to succeed. If the wily Marcellus has his way, Tova will get hers. I should mention that one learns a bit about the lives of giant octopi and how Marcellus came to live in a tank in a aquarium.The narrators were great. Ethan's Scottish voice made me melt and Tovas voice fit my picture of her wonderfully. Well done!",4
769,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"Audiobook….read by Marin Ireland and Michael Urle….11 hours and 16 minutesThis is a thoroughly enjoyable book!A debut classic is born!!I have fully fallen in love with this gem as others have.Thank you to *Cheri* for her wonderful review who first turned me on to this priceless quirky novel.Note of interest… unrelated per say…But scientist recently figured out why female octopuses self-destruct.After she lays her eggs she does with any new parent would…carefully watch over her progeny. She stays with them and protects them from predators blowing water over them to keep them oxygenated, writes Nicolas Bakalar for the New York Times”.“But then her behavior turns bizarre; she stops eating and begins to self mutilate, tearing off her skin or even eating her own arms. She’s dead before the eggs can hatch”.Our ‘A-Star-is-Born’ octopusin “Remarkably Bright Creatures” — is a male …. so Marcellus has about a 4 year life span…(as Marcellus himself will tell us)…If Marcellus was a female octopus she would die [self-destruct] soon after she lays her eggs.By the time a young octopus wiggles out of its egg, its mother is already dead.….Shelby Van Pelt (tons of talent), is going to have her challenges following up with her next novel…but I don’t doubt for a second that she won’t continue to surprise readers again and again.As sappy as it sounds having an octopus as a leading character—Shelby absolutely makes it works brilliantly… (feelings are all so real)…and if readers look closer —wise symbolism is sprinkling throughout.….Themes of love, loss, grief, loneliness, and friendships, are strong.The characters are gloriously genuine.….You can bet, I’ll choose to read Shelby’s next book!The audiobook-narrators empowers this story exceptionally!!",5
770,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"This book is very popular and adored by so many so I'm just going to keep this short.I feel a bit disappointed like I read a different book. I thought the first half was very good and I even chuckled at parts. After a while, I realized that I'm constantly waiting for Marcellus to show up. I love his POV and it reminds me of the octopus in ""Resident Alien"" TV show. While waiting for him, I become increasingly annoyed by one of the characters. 😫 And I'm sorry to say, I have very little interest in the other character.I feel like I might regret not giving it a higher rating, a bit of ""Frick Island"" Deja Vu.",3
771,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"This must be my Year of the Octopus. After watching and lovingMy Octopus Teacheron Netflix, I’m more than a little obsessed with these amazing, intelligent creatures. This is my second book featuring octopuses (no, it’s not octopi), in as many months.Tova, the 70-year-old cleaning lady at the aquarium, is grieving the recent loss of her husband, and the son who disappeared 30 years ago. Outside of work, I enjoyed the interactions she had with her friends, the Knit Wits. Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus who lives in the aquarium, is nearing the end of his short (4-ish) life, having never known freedom, despite his nightly escapes to other tanks to get a tasty snack. Cameron is the new employee, a struggling young man who is on a quest to find the father he never knew.The chapters alternate between these three characters, and while I enjoyed all three, I wanted more of Marcellus. He is a grumpy old man with a heart of gold. The best part is we are privy to his witty and snarky thoughts, usually about humans. Snark gets me every time.How these three lives intertwine makes for a heartwarming, feel-good story. There’s a mystery to solve, one Marcellus has figured out. He only has to find a way to get the humans to piece the puzzle together. He might be curmudgeonly, but he has a soft spot for these two, especially Tova, with whom he shares a strong bond. You know where the story is going, but it’s OK, because the journey there is charming and delightful. Marcellus, of course, stole my heart, putting a smile on my face, and a lump in my throat.Readers who enjoy Fredrik Backman, (although he’s hit or miss with me), will likely love this one too.* I received a digital copy of this book via NetGalley. All opinions are my own.",4
772,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"I wish I could rate this book higher.I loved Tova and Marcellus so much. They get 5 stars easily.But Cameron is such a horrible cry baby/man child I give him 0 stars. How is he 30, but every decision he makes is so infantile and selfish? For example, if he had to cancel a date, why wouldn't he call the person instead of going to her place of business and telling her tèenager? Sure, he becomes less horrible by the end, but I disliked him so much by then that I didn't care, and honestly, I doubted his character arc. No one that far behind in life would be able to become a functional adult so quickly.Also there were a lot of things in this debut novel that didn't ring true for the modern era and seemed to take up a lot of time just to add drama. Like the hunt for the real estate guy just took so long. Any middle-aged real estate agent would have a Facebook page. Cam could have looked him up and dmed him, no need to drive a fuel inefficient vehicle all over Washington.I can see why this is such a popular book there are a lot of heart warming aspects like the Octopus detective and the rich character descriptions are great, but I just couldn't stomach Cameron who thought it was OK to walk around with chocolate on his face, smelling like other people's urine.",3
773,Remarkably Bright Creatures,2.5😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,2
774,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"When I heard the premise of this book, I imagined an octopus POV would be used as the jumping point for reflections on captivity, ""otherness"", different forms of intelligence, or respect of nature... sadly I found none of that here.It's just your average ""intersecting destinies"" story with a very predictable plot proceeding at a snail-like pace.The writing style is similarly unremarkable. It is built from three POVs, one of which belongs to an octopus (great!), one to an unremarkable old lady (less great) and one to an absolutely insufferable, whiny man-child who talks in the kind of overly colloquial writing style (""bicep day's been lit at the gym lately"") that I really cannot stand (definitely not great).Overall, a waste of a good cephalopod.",1
775,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"I'm sure many may disagree with this review, based on the love that this book has received, but I really didn't find anything special here. I found the relationship with the octopus charming but the rest of the story was very middle of the road, and achingly slow... the characters were very 2D and trite.. the boy was annoying to the point of cartoon angst.... it's interesting, but it's not groundbreaking at all",3
776,Remarkably Bright Creatures,4.5 StarsI wish there was more Marcellus in the book! I love that Octopus! I loved Tova too!Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾,5
777,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"Given the current state of the world, one needs a charming story that tugs at the heart yet is uplifting. “Remarkably Bright Creatures” is the perfect novel that will take your mind away from current politics and an unsettled world. Plus, an octopus is one of the main characters! Who doesn’t love a good cephalopod story? For those who are familiar with octopuses and their clever antics, you enjoy this story.Marcellus McSquiddles, a giant Pacific octopus who is held in Sowell Bay Aquarium (and a bit of a curmudgeon) begins the story narrating his life in captivity. He has a special relationship with the nightly cleaner, Tova Sullivan. Tova is a widower whose eighteen-year-old son went missing over thirty years ago, and she still feels the loss daily. Tova is an excellent cleaner who takes her job seriously. She’s seventy years old and is on the verge of retiring. Yet she loves all her exhibits of sea life.Tova is part of a group of women who call themselves “the Knit-Wits” who also provide some smiles in this wonderful read, and she works at the aquarium at night. Marcellus has been getting bold in his endeavors to find tasty fresh seafood. Yes, he has fun escaping a nibbling on other exhibits and keeping Tova on her toes.Other main characters are Ethan, a Scotsman who owns the local grocery story, and has a romantic interest in Tova, although she doesn’t see it. A young man named Cameron comes to Sowell Bay in search of his father. He finds a job in the grocery store working for Ethan.Author Shelby Van Pelt expertly weaves the characters’ stories together. Although each character has sad emotional issues such as loss, grief, aging, and secrets, the story remains hopeful. Van Pelt keeps the secrets hidden from the reader, and the unveiling of the secrets is a reader’s joy. Marcellus has the best secrets.The chapters are short which leads to the reading enjoyment along with the wonderful prose and observations. Life is sad and can be devastatingly difficult to endure, yet Van Pelt writes of the human spirit, the human need to find light and happiness.This is a remarkably endearing read!",4
778,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"4.2⭐️ what a ride through a genre I didn't know existed 🥺💙✔️ domestic fiction✔️ feel-good mystery✔️ exploration of friendship✔️ coastal setting✔️ three povs-randomolder lady's pov (Tova)-randomyoung man's pov (Cameron)- giant pacific octopus's povSuch are the secrets the sea holds. What I would not give to explore them again. If I could go back in time, I would collect all of it—the sneaker sole, the shoelace, the buttons, and the twin key. I would give it all to her. I am sorry for her loss. Returning this key is the least I can do. -Marcellus, the giant pacific Octopusthis isn't a thrilling story, it didn't particularly give me joy but it did give me feelings I do not know how to properly articulate.Tova works in the town's aquarium and is still grieving about her son she lost at sea years ago, presumed dead and ruled a suicide. Tova has doubts about the unanswered questions surrounding the mystery of her son's death.When an unlikely friendship develops between Tova and Marcellus, we learn from the fresh perspective of a tale told by an octopus that her mother's intuition was right and that there was more to the police report of her greatest tragedy.We see Cameron, a young man who can't get hisshitlife together long enough to keep a job or girlfriend go on a quest to findhis deadbeat dadsome free cash. When he arrives in Sowell Bay just in time to be a temp for Tova's job as a cleaner in the aquarium, these characters's stories intersect beautifully to create a heartwarming read that's wise and quirky. A wonderful portrayal of how to thrive in loneliness ❤️❤️***not my boss asking me to read this book and let her know if it's actually good soshe doesn't have to waste her time on itWHAT- ✋🏽😭😭",4
779,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"Remarkably Bright Creatures is a heartwarming, sweet story! I loved the characters in this book, especially Marcellus, the octopus! I liked that I learned a lot of awesome facts about octopuses while enjoying this book. The storyline was engaging, and it was a warm, emotional story. This book definitely pulled at the heart strings and I know this will be one that sticks with me for awhile. Highly recommend!",4
780,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"Goodreads Choice Award: Nominee for Best Fiction (2022), Nominee for Best Debut Novel (2022)Hopefully now it will get the attention it deserves!🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙Remarkably Bright Creatures: 11 hours 16 minutesWonderfully narrated by Marin Ireland and with Michael Urie as Marcellus“I’d like to be…under the sea, In An Octopus’s Garden, in the shade…” 🐙 (The Beatles)Day 1,299 of CaptivityThe book opens with Marcellus McSquiddles (named by the 4 year old daughter of the Aquarium’s manager) introducing himself to us with a warning that the life span of a Giant Pacific Octopus is only 4 years (1,460 days) so our time with him WILL be brief. He was “rescued” as an injured juvenile and has, at most just 160 days left, until his sentence is complete.Crabs, Clams, Shrimp, Scallops, Cockles, Abalones, fish and fish eggs would be his normal diet in the sea…but, he is served Mackerel, Halibut and Herring at the Sowell Bay Aquarium-MOSTLY herring due to their low cost. Ick!So, you cannot blame “the guy” for escaping from his tank, overnight when something “tastier” is within reach.Day 1,300 of CaptivityMarcellus almost didn’t survive the 159 days remaining.If the aquarium’s oldest employee, a 70 year old cleaning lady, named Tova Sullivan hadn’t found him right as the 18 minutes he could survive outside of water was just about up, day 1,300 may have been his last.Because the Octopus is a “remarkably, bright creature”-a bond is formed, but unfortunately, Tova is injured while helping the 60 pound Cephalopoda.Tova can’t just sit home at night. Evening is the most difficult time for the widow who recently lost her husband of 47 years, and has no surviving children after losing her only son Erik, when he was just 18. So, she decides to “train” the new guy, Cameron Cassmore, who will be temporarily cleaning the Aquarium while she recovers.She, (and Marcellus-who is more observant than ANY human) will find themselves involved in the mystery about what brought the “new guy” to town-JUST the stimulation a bored Octopus needed!I was concerned about picking up this book when it first became popular on my Goodreads feed. I didn’t want to become attached to Marcellus just to read about him getting injured or dying.NOT TO WORRY! The details of his final day are NOT described in this story.Marcellus IS the star in the way that a “supporting actor” often steals the show! He is the thread that binds the three narratives together despite having the fewest chapters.But, this is just as much a story about a community, and a gentle reminder that ENDINGS also bring about new BEGINNINGS.Sometimes you find something that you didn’t even realize you were looking for!!This is a NOT TO BE MISSED delightful DEBUT that had me joyfully humming that Beatles tune for days after finishing ! AVAILABLE NOW!A buddy read with DeAnn! Check out her amazing review for additional thoughts!!Thank You to the Chandler Public Library for the loan of the Audible and a Physical copy of the book. It was fun toggling between the two! 💕",5
781,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"4.5, rounded upI want suction marks on MY arm!You don’t give me a huge, wise old octopus and then have him take a back seat. Well, toward the end of the book, he (our octopus named Marcellus) gets more airtime, but at the beginning I’d say his presence is a tease.My favorite things were the suction marks that Marcellus made when he wrapped his tentacles around an arm of Tova, a 70-year-old janitor at an aquarium. I was jealous! Branded by an octopus, hot diggety! I know, most people wouldn’t like having suction marks all over their arm—the big purple dots would probably look like hickies. And what is an old lady doing with a bunch of hickies on her arm anyway? (Forget that fantasy, please!) But I pictured the marks as perfectly round polka dots, a beautiful and unique henna design. Tattoos to love! (I’m also assuming they didn’t hurt, of course.) No one would every guess they were suction marks made by a friendly octopus. We see lots of secrets in our lit, but come on, has anyone ever had to keep THAT kind of secret?! Imagine her spilling the beans when someone asked her what the hell those bruises on her arm were. “Oh, an octopus was wrapped around my arm for a bit. No biggie.”This is the story of Tova the janitor and Marcellus the octopus, both old-timers. Don’t worry, we don’t have a talking octopus here (he and Tova don’t have conversations)—that would have been a turnoff for me. Instead, we get to hear Marcellus’s clever thoughts as he observes the humans around him. He’s a wise creature who occasionally escapes his tank in search of food treats. He’s funny and smart. (In real life, octopuses are smart—a cool fact that had me running to Google to learn more.) Oh, and Marcellus is curmudgeonly—but yet he’s also very helpful. Putting tape over my mouth because I don’t want to give anything away.The story is also about a guy named Cameron, who is searching for his dad. The chapters alternate between him, Tova, and Marcellus. I loved Marcellus’s chapters the best. His observations about humans are a riot (like, why do they call him a “smart cookie”?). His chapters are short and I always wanted more; it was a jolt to move to a realistic story all of the sudden and it was always a slight comedown.Oh, the realistic story is well done, don’t get me wrong. I loved both Tova and Cameron—both sympathetic and well-drawn. The writing is good. The plot is interesting and fast moving, but there is one huge coincidence that you have to buy into. I overlooked that the situation was unlikely because I liked the book so much. Also, the ending is a little too tight for my liking, but then again, it’s heartwarming. Who doesn’t want a feel-good ending these days?It didn’t hurt that the book is set in my hood, a town near Seattle. I had to laugh—Tova doesn’t like to drive on freeways anymore. And she had to head to Bellingham, a (real) town two hours away. I’m the same age and I won’t drive on freeways anymore, either—and a friend moving to Bellingham was a disaster for me because I couldn’t drive to visit her. I loved that little similarity—funny that it was the very same town! Although Tova and I had age and a fear of freeways in common, I did not identify with her need to clean. But I can definitely see myself liking an octopus like she did.I realize that I like more edge, which I thought I would get, of course, with an octopus as a main character. The deal is, it’s realistic fiction with a dab of magical realism. It sort of reminds me of Kevin Wilson’sNothing to See Here, which I loved. In Wilson’s book, we have a realistic story line, but it also happens to have kids who explode. Here, we also have a realistic story line, but it’s an octopus that’s the weird part. Marcellus reminds me a little of cool Charlotte the spider in the kids’ book,Charlotte's Web.I loved this book—and its bright cover—and I’ll be checking out the author’s next offering. This is a strong debut! And of course, I’ll be reading more about those smart-cookie octopuses!Thanks to Edelweiss for an advance copy.",5
782,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"Absolutely adored this book in all of its sappy, coincidence-ridden glory.Listened to the audiobook narrated by the stellar Marin Ireland with a bit of help from Michael Urie as Marcellus (the Giant Pacific Octopus). If you have a choice, the audiobook is a fantastic way to experience this lovely, heartwarming book.Tova is a seventy year old widow who lost her son many years ago and spends her nights cleaning the local aquarium. Marcellus is an octopus nearing the end of his life. He is a Remarkably Bright Creature. One night he and Tova forge a bond. Cameron is a wayward young man floating from job to job and lamenting that his mother abandoned him when he was young and never told him who his father was. When he finds a clue that leads to a man in Washington state, Cameron leaves California to go confront him.This book contains one of my absolute favorite themes--found family. And one could even include Marcellus in that mix because although his role in the story isn't very large, it is certainly impactful. As I mentioned, there are a plethora of coincidences in this novel, so you'll have to set that aside to enjoy the simple beauty of the tale if those types of things bother you. Cameron has a LOT of growing up to do, which he does through the course of the novel.This is overall a sweet, feel-good tale that will be sure to bring a smile to your face.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book. All opinions are my own.",5
783,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"Did I miss something?Everyone else seems to have been enchanted with this story. Not I.In the first third of the novel, it was painfully obvious how the story would conclude.Do you remember Romeo and Juliet? Mr. Shakespeare was the King of Spoilers when he tells us the outcome of the ill-fated lovers in the very first paragraph. But he told a story worthy of rippling through the ages.In contrast, Remarkably Bright Creatures is boring. The storytelling needed sharpening because most of the book was superfluous and should have been distilled to the dialogue.Additionally, the narrative voice is lackluster (aside from the Marcellus/octopus sections). This book would have benefited from some hilarious moments or some snarky comments. Van Pelt shines when writing in the first person, and all of the sections should have been written using that perspective.Bored stiff and couldn't wait for this to end.Sorry, Tova.How much I spent:Hardcover text – Free through Mel-Cat (Michigan Library System)Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",2
784,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"This story begins 1,299 days after Marcellus was captured, after he’d been taken from his home and robbed of his freedom, and left in this small space, surrounded by glass walls. He’s fed, and observed through the glass that surrounds him by various people throughout the days, but he longs to return to his home. To be free. Periodically he manages somehow to escape, but is always found by Tova, who makes sure the boss isn’t aware of how often she finds him .Tova began working there after her husband died, preferring to share her time with those who don’t ask a lot of questions, and so she and Marcellus develop a kind of silent bond. Tova shares some stories, but Marcellus can also see the sadness that weighs her down, and so periodically he will leave her small tokens. While he manages to, periodically, stray beyond his glass walls that are meant to keep him from straying, Tova’s fondness for him grows. Her affection for him grows, as does his for her.This is a love story, but not your typical one.A new employee joins the ranks, a young man, Cameron Cassmore, who has recently arrived in search of a father he never knew, and a mother who disappeared from his life when he was young. He’s not really qualified for much, employment-wise, and so it’s up to Tova to make sure he knows what the job entails. Cameron thinks he’s there just as a maintenance worker, but he’s surprised when there’s much more to this job than mopping floors. There’s Marcellus. And Marcellus is full of surprises.Have I mentioned that Marcellus is a giant octopus?This is a book that is touted as being for fans ofA Man Called Ove, and I can see that, but for me, this reminded me more of Kevin Wilson’s’Nothing to See Here’- in the best way. The quirkiness, the unexpected twists and turns, and the somewhat bizarre premise that managed to completely pull me in despite how outside the box this unfolded. Filled with a quirky unconventional charm, I’ll be smiling every time I think of this story. A story that embraces the idea of love and connection across borders in every sense, and a story of family lost and found.Published: 03 Apr 2022Many thanks for the ARC provided by Ecco",5
785,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"AsSwayeis my witness, I called this book’s ending on page four. Well, half the ending.And you probably will, too.This novel isn’t out to surprise (or, if it is, that's a big fail-o-rama), save with its novel octopus POV. Mostly, it’s a bittersweet reflection on grief and aging and loneliness and family.And all of these topics are worthy of meditation.As for the writing itself: some of it feels inspired, but most of it does not. Around our female lead, Tova, everything crackles and glows. The dialogue feels right. The sorrow and grit are there. Same with our octopus lead, Marcellus. But the other characters feel less fully realized.My advice if you plan to read this novel: lay down any expectations of elegant prose and intricate character development in all but the two main players. And even there, don’t get crazy. This is a simple, mainstream novel, with an interesting sea creature twist. It’s a beach read, or a palette cleanser in between meatier works. Sorry, but them’s the facts.Two things didreally bother meduring this mostly decent, if unremarkable, read. May I get them off my chest?First, Shelby Van Pelt is not a master of nuanced foreshadowing. I can’t give you specific examples, or I’ll spoil the plot, but I was bludgeoned by hints of things to come. I found myself thinking: I’m not an idiot, lady. You don’t have to hit me over the head with your clues.Second, Van Pelt is absolutely in love with the word “some,” and not in a good way. Normal people probably won't trouble at this, but I get OCD with my pet peeves. Please allow me to give you three examples of how the author’s use of the word “some” drove me apeshit by story’s end:1. “Two clicks to downloadsome travel apphe saw a commercial about, withsome schtickabout guaranteeing rock-bottom prices” (104).So... to clarify: do you not know which travel app he used? Or, could you not make one up?2. “I was watchingsome showon the travel channel the other day” (245).Which show, now?3. “They were interviewing him about trends in vacation home sales orsome boring thing” (245).Wait, please. Were they interviewing him about trends in vacation home sales, or about “some” other “boring thing”? What exactly did this supposed interview entail, Ms. Van Pelt? You’re the only one who knows for sure, and I’d really like to be looped in.…I’ve given you three examples here, but the author does this at least 100 times in 360 pages. I’m not exaggerating. And to me, this feels lazy. An author’s job is to create a believable world, full of believable details. Vagaries do not achieve this end, especially in such abundance.In closing, I was really looking forward to reading this story, and I was mildly disappointed with it. Really, I got more pleasure from reading other people’s reviews about the novelty of an octopus narrator than I got from reading the actual book. Oh well, that’s life sometimes.My consolation prize, stimulating dialogue with a savvy buddy-reader, more than makes up for this otherwise lackluster experience.Book/Song Pairing: Never Let Me Go (Florence + The Machine)youtu.be/zMBTvuUlm98",3
786,Remarkably Bright Creatures,"4.5 Stars. This was a charming story about family, friendships, loss, grief, aging, loneliness, unlikely connections and moving on. The story is set in a small town overlooking Puget Sound, Washington State.The story is told from the perspective of three characters. Tova is a 70-year-old widow. Thirty years ago, her son, Erik, died at the age of 18 in a boating mishap. His body was never recovered. There were rumours of suicide or perhaps murder, but Tova firmly believes it was an unfortunate accident. Her grief was overwhelming, but she kept going by working as a cleaner in an aquarium and taking pride in her work.She has no living family and keeps to herself, except for occasional meetings with three women her own age, the Knit-Wits. One of the women can no longer cope with some household tasks and is moving away to live with her daughter. This makes Tova realize that this would not be an alternative for her without any living family members. While growing older, she plans to sell her house, get rid of years of belongings, and move into an upscale senior-care facility.Tova has made friends with a 60-pound Pacific octopus, Marcellus. Viewers of the award-winning documentary 'My Octopus Teacher' will understand how intelligent these creatures can be. Tova talks to Marcellus and thinks he understands her conversations. The octopus can manipulate his large body, enabling him to squeeze out of a small opening in his glass cage and wander about the room. He can only be outside the cage for 18 minutes, or his life is in danger. He has been in the aquarium for about three years of captivity and is nearing the end of his life span. He longs to return to the sea. Marcellus seems to understand what Tova says to him and is adept at observing people's features, mannerisms and emotions. He likes to collect and hide his miscellaneous treasures out of sight in his cage. He is very bright and knows things that Tova and another cleaner haven't figured out yet.Then there is Cameron, a thirty-year-old man who is a deadbeat, down in his luck, and close to hitting rock bottom. He cannot keep a job, is fired often, and is now unemployed due to a lack of effort on his part. His girlfriend has just kicked him out of her apartment. He is now homeless. Cameron's mother left him with his kindly aunt when he was a young boy, and he never knew the identity of his father. He has come across a few clues that seem to point to a wealthy man in Washington State as his father. He travels from California and is now in town, intent on finding that man and extorting money from him. His backpack contained a few items he hoped to pawn but ended up in Italy by airline error.He borrows $2000 from his aunt but wastes most of it on a junky van.I admit I tried to read this book several months ago and felt Cameron, his laziness, schemes and mishaps belonged in another book, and the character had been inserted as a space filler. I gave up and didn't finish. I should have had more patience. There was also an older man, Ethan, the grocery store owner, and I didn't understand his role. I wanted to read more about Tova and Marcellus instead. This time I read the book in one day. I mentioned unlikely connections earlier, and this time I was rewarded by a heartfelt and lovely story. It emphasizes how animals can elevate loneliness and sadness and how unlikely connections can enrich lives. Some outcomes were predictable, but I kept reading while enjoying this heartwarming and compelling book.",5
787,Never Lie,"I read this as part of a group buddy read on Instagram which is why I didn't yeet it into outer space.One sentence review:L M F A O you're jokingSYNOPSISNewlyweds Tricia and Ethan are snowed in during their viewing at the creepy, dusty, secluded mcmansion once owned by Dr. Adrienne Hale, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace four years ago. When Tricia finds her secret tapes of her sessions, she starts listening to get to the bottom of the doctor's disappearance.MY OPINIONBUCKLE TF UP. THIS IS ABOUT TO BE A LONG ONE.Where to start, where to start? Ok let's do the writing. I truly believe there are sixth graders who can write more compelling sentences. Here's an excerpt that nearly gave me an aneurysm:But my attention goes back to that white cashmere sweater I had been slobbering over last night. I love cashmere. I mean, everyone does. What sort of freak doesn’t like cashmere? And the sweater is so white. Like unblemished snow. I grab the sweater and pull it off the hanger. I throw it over my head, almost groaning in ecstasy at how nice the fabric feels against my skin. I love cashmere.I wish I was joking. Yep, she writes ""I love cashmere"" twice in a matter of sentences. I was almost hoping the cashmere was going to be laced with some kind of toxin that would kill Tricia and her four brain cells just so something interesting could happen, but nah, homegirl just looooooOOOOves cashmere.Then we have the aggressive spoon-feeding. I felt like I was being choked to death with the flashing neon sign foreshadowing that Freida deployed. Here's a sample:I don’t know why my friends don’t like him. Whenever we talk about him, they always say, this is a red flag, or that’s a red flag. But Ethan is a genuinely good guy. What does it matter that he hasn’t had many girlfriends before me? And why should the fact that he lost his parents and doesn’t have much family be a reason I should avoid him?The author repeats this train of thought so many times that even Ray Charles could see what was coming.Next, we have the ""click baity writing"" where the author mentions a secret (in this case, many, many times) but won't reveal the secret until much later in a lazy attempt to create suspense. See:I hope he still feels that way after what I have to tell him this weekend. I have a terrible feeling that the conversation will not go well.Ok and if by the grace of Beyonce you can get past this amateur hour writing, the characters are asstastic and plot has more holes than a cheese grater. Yes, yes, I know this is a popcorn thriller, so yeetage of disbelief is required. But I refuse to yeet my logic just for some Hallmark-grade entertainment. And once again, stop inserting ""intelligent"" and ""highly educated"" psychiatrists into these books if they're gonna have the logic of a bloated dead fish. Just stick with the naive mom of three who works in a craft store.SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOMAt first Freida makes sure we know the house is very dusty, much dust, dust everywhere. And this dustiness grosses Tricia out because it totally clashes with Ethan's BMW (it's not a car, it's a BMW), her Manolo Blahnik boots and Ralph Lauren wool coat. But then she's okay with sleeping in her undies and bra in a bed that has been empty for THREE years?? And puts on a dead woman's RED FUZZY ROBE AND SLIPPERS?????? The real mystery is how the house was selectively dusty.Another one of my pet peeves is the unreliable narrator that lies for funsies, which of course we have in this shitshow of a book. Surprise, Tricia actually has a history with the house even though the readers are led to believe she's shooketh. And she had been stalking Ethan beforehand. Now why did she lie about these things? No reason, just trying to force a twist where there isn't one.Tricia's behaviour doesn't even make sense. So homegirl comes back to the house to find the bodyodyody that Dr. Hale left in the house (need that chemical spray she ordered off Amazon for my dog's bed tbh) but instead of searching the house, she decides to listen to recorded sessions... for what? Was she hoping that EJ would say ""hey, if you decide to murk me, can you bury me under your living room floor??? Tysm."" Priorities!!!!! This would've made more sense if ETHAN listened to the tapes and then put 2+2 = Tricia is a crazy bish together.Lastly, tell me how Tricia can get away with murdering nearly ten people that are all intimately known to her. So her grammy and fiance and besties all die and no one bats an eye? Even Detective Pikachu could make the connections. Cmon now.Ok, I'm going to cut myself off, but overall, this book was STANKY. I've read two others by her: The Locked Door was ight and The Housemaid was not ight in the slightest. Adding her to my avoid list lol.PROS AND CONSPros: funny rants with the buddy readers, she did have some good red herrings in there tbhCons: ... did I stutter? 😂___Check out my YouTube",1
788,Never Lie,"What is with all these 4 star+ rated thrillers being so awful?I mean, I get that this book is quite compelling, especially with the use of short chapters and the psychiatrist's tape recordings to keep the pacing up... but, come on, go back and reread the first few chapters after finishing this book and tell me the twist makes sense. Because it really doesn't.So many people have recommended McFadden to me. I actually went and picked up this book andThe Housemaidat the same time, but now I'm reluctant to start her other stuff because parts of this were laughably bad.It's hard to say which was the worst thing. The repetition of the same thing over and over?It was a worrying reminder of the fact that I’ve only known my husband for a little over a year.It’s yet another reminder that I’ve only known this man for a little over a year.The way the author hammered us over the head with a red herring to the point that I felt a little insulted?Tricia discovers tapes of sessions with ""EJ"", a psychopath and wine connoisseur with a ""familiar"" voice. Her husband is called Ethan, is a wine connoisseur, has a temper sometimes, has no known friends or family and, she notes, she doesn't know him very well at all 🙄Or the ludicrous twists thatmayhave worked if this book had been written in third person, but in first person are utterly absurd?Also, the author does this weird thing where a character will say something via dialogue, then the narrator will make an extremely obvious observation about it in their inner monologue. For example:“Don’t let him manipulate you,” Ethan says. “He isn’t a good person. He killed [spoiler]. He killed one of the people closest to him. What kind of person does that?”Ethan doesn’t have a clue that [spoiler] isn’t the one who killed [spoiler].No shit! She does this multiple times.In some ways, two stars feels generous, but then I did blast through this with a need to know what the hell was going on. Not many authors manage to keep the suspense going like that.",2
789,Never Lie,"Ok, I’m an outlier based on the reviews so far. I don’t think the book is bad or not worth reading, it has the Freida trademark suspense vibe with a crazy twist. It actually reminded me a bit of one of her previous book that I also had trouble with for the same reason as this one. Without going into too much detail my problem was that the ending made some of the previous events unlikely. There were too many inconsistencies. The author was clever when it came to leading you in a direction that might or might not be the right one, but that is because some reactions should have been different based on what you learned later.I also have an observation; Why did he go to work when they had no internet access in the house ?",3
790,Never Lie,***5 STARS***What a ride! I couldn’t put this book down until I read the last word.Edge of your seat suspense! A captivating psychological thriller that has twists and turns galore. I thought I had it figured out but I was so wrong.Very well written with an intricate plot and well developed characters. A must read.,5
791,Never Lie,If you like horrible writing and a plot that makes no sense then this is for you,1
792,Never Lie,"I've never read a book faster in my life...This review was long overdue.There's not much you can say about a thriller without spoiling it but let's try!PLOT A young couple goes to take a look at the house they possibly want to purchase. But, there's a snow storm and they're stuck in the house. From the first moment, the house seems kind of weird. In the living room, there's this portrait of a woman with piercing green eyes that covers the whole wall. And also, there's this huge bookshelf filled with many copies of the same book, ""Anatomy of Fear"" written by a psychiatrist who was murdered three years ago. Is this her home? Did she die here? Are they alone in this house? Not likely.THOUGHTS I often tell a book is fast-paced (everything is when you have ADHD). BUT THIS, THIS WAS OVER IN A HEARTBEAT. It was simply written, just how I like my thrillers, I don't need good descriptions, just give me the creeps. And it SURE DID DELIVER. I want to read everything this author has put out and I'm so glad I jumped on this band wagon.And of course it ended on such a plot twist, I simultaneously started screaming and banging my head CUZ HOW HAVEN'T I NOTICED THAT BEFORE?AMAZING, GO READ IT!!!",5
793,Never Lie,4.5 ⭐️ FREIDA MCFADDEN CAN DO NO WRONG.this is my fourth book by her in a week and i’m quite literally obsessed. idk what she puts in these but GIVE MEEE MOREEE.that ending!!!!!!!!! i never saw any of this coming. obsessed.,4
794,Never Lie,"A book that could’ve been so so good, if the author wasn’t desperate to throw in a twist that absolutely nobody could guess.The only problem is - no one guessed it because it made no sense. If I read it again, knowing the twist, about 85% of the book wouldn’t add up.Makes me feel like I just wasted my time reading this.",2

Their plans take an unexpected turn when they find themselves stranded in the midst of a relentless snowstorm, compelling them to seek refuge in the seemingly deserted home of Adrienne Hale, a psychologist who mysteriously vanished without a trace.As the narrative progresses, it peels back the layers of this perplexing mystery, unveiling a web of intricate and sometimes twisted plotlines. Each revelation adds a new dimension to the story, keeping the reader utterly engaged and often taken by surprise. It's a narrative that gradually builds to a crescendo, leaving you with an ending that is not just jaw-dropping but also thought-provoking, resonating with you long after you've turned the final page.I really enjoyed this book because my friends had raved about the author so much that they practically forced me to read it. The writing was straightforward and easy to follow, and the pacing was just right. What stood out the most was the plot's unpredictability. Unlike previous thrillers where I could often guess the twists early on, this book kept me guessing right up to the end. It was a refreshing change from the usual predictability I've encountered in the genre.The pace at which the story unfolds is perfectly balanced, keeping my interest piqued throughout.The author's ability to seamlessly interweave both timelines added a beautiful dimension to the book, rendering it a truly accessible and engaging read. However, I encountered a writing style quirk that didn't quite align with my personal taste. It felt as if the narrative had a distinct influence from the Wattpad era, characterized by a prevalence of short, punchy sentences that often concluded rather abruptly. While this stylistic choice might appeal to many readers, I found it somewhat irksome. The lack of full sentences and the frequent terseness in the writing gave the prose a staccato quality, which, in my opinion, disrupted the fluidity of the narrative. This, of course, is a matter of personal preference, and others may not share the same sentiment.—Overall, if you're in the mood for a thrilling read that keeps you engaged from start to finish and delivers a jaw-dropping twist that you won't see coming, this book should be on your must-read list.",5
796,Never Lie,"★1 starAbsurd.Not to mention dry and tedious.Anytime someone goes house shopping and set their eyes on thepeople-may-or-may-not-have-died-here-but-you-can-get-it-for-a-low-low-price-of-uhmm-say-your-eternal-soulit's a plot hole for sure.It's also very possible that this was written by two people who had very different ideas.You write the intro and the middle and I'll do the ending then we'll call it a book! Exciting!Did the writer actually read the first 200 pages before she published it? —asking for a friend.Tricia was so distraught and terrified because her new husband wants to buy the house they're currently snowed in which looks like a lived-in horror house in the middle of nowhere. Later we learn that everything was orchestrated and that she had different motives coming to the house. So, how is it that her emotions and state of mind in the beginning is not only inconsistent but strikingly contradictory towards the end. I guess we'll just chalk it up to antisocial personality disorder?This book's saving grace is that these two dysfunctional human beings ended up together, saving the world from their chaos. Well done, they deserve each other.Also, in this economy I can totally understand the urgency to close on a real estate property on a steal price and 100% get on board with living in a mcmansion in the middle of nowhere even if it's with dead corpses.“Everyone dies eventually, right? So unless we buy a brand new house, you’re kind of guaranteed somebody has lived in it who’s now dead. So what?”It's a good financial move. I can totally respect that.Poor writing.If this tried to be a read-it-again-for-a-different-story type of book, it failed.Mood setting is lousy. And I never appreciated the inner dialogues that just keeps on going in circles which only serves to make the characters look dumber but I get it, it does help fill the word count. For once, if the floor creaks I'd want someone to actually investigate and not be like'it be like that sometimes', 'that's just how it be'or not dismiss it with'maybe that's just — ', 'i guess it's —', if not, you best believe I'll be rooting for your character to dies first.I don't know about you butwhen I read psychological thrillers I crave for my brain to be challenged! I want it to be engrossing enough that I analyze everything and actually care about what happens next.I believe that precisely to be the hallmark of attentive reading/listening — it's when your audience comprehend the story enough that they are able to make solid assumptions and predictions as the story progresses. Don't you love it when you try to figure the mystery out? It's gratifying when you're right and incredibly disappointing when you don't. That in itself I think is a rewarding feeling as an author/creator/producer, to have your audience care about your work enough to be feel satisfaction in experiencing your stories/art. And I believe that is how the author and their readers communicate through the pages — forgive me for saying this but I believe that's the magic of books!Unfortunately, some thriller writer have become so invested in surprising their audience —so many twist!, woahhh the twist!, wait for the twist!— they try outmaneuver their audience that they messed up the story they had been building. This is exactly what happened here. Even worse isthe story completely ignored earlier events and details to fit the twist into its narrative!That's just mean and disrespectful.exhibit A:wearing boots not suited for the weather; if this was all planned, the least she can do is come dressed for the occasionexhibit B:showing of a real estate property that's not been cleaned or staged yet has food in store ... like that's not weird at allexhibit C:tape recorder battery that's still working after three years of no useexhibit D:not getting home security system a priority; it's 2022, I honestly cannot think of a single human being specifically of female species who would be so opposed to the idea of getting a home security installed in this day and age, I mean come on, don't you watch the freaking news?! You can buy a 360 camera on amazon for $40 or at least get a dog.exhibit E:trying to find a mobile service and when they did, they did NOT call the policeA good twist rewards the most attentive audience and while it's true that the most satisfying twist are the ones you figure out seconds before it's revealed, it's also imperative that the details and foreshadowing clicks into its place otherwise it's all just a big fat scam. As they say, the devil is in the detail.It's dark-lite. Not exactly addictive. It's a psychological thriller by virtue of it being sensational. Popcorn thriller for sure.Good thing it's short.I rated it 2 star and I explained my whys in great details. Avid fans can be so rabid sometimes.Edit: I was being generous by giving it a 2-star rating. It's a 0-star. I'm sorry but everything she puts out deteriorates my braincells from the cosmic amount of stupidity. Pure lazy stupid writing.",1
797,Never Lie,"Finally, Tricia and Ethan are ready to buy their first home together. They’ve found a remote house with an extensive but disturbing history. The previous owner mysteriously vanished and is presumed to have been murdered.Ethan is fascinated and desperately wants this home. On the other side of the coin, Tricia says, (to herself) over her dead body will she ever agree to live here!But fate intervenes with a massive snowstorm that strands them during the showing. They have no cell service, and with their realtor conveniently a no show, the couple realize they need to just settle in until a rescue can be made. Who knows…maybe that gives them extra time to learn more about the house and its previous owner.I never completely meshed with this story. So much of it was over-the-top unrealistic. I think we all want to feel that we could walk in the shoes of the characters we read about even if only for a moment. (Or a chapter). But it just wasn’t possible here.I’ve read (listened to) one other book by this authorThe Inmateand enjoyed it. Perhaps the next will play out better (for me).Thank you to NetGalley and Dreamscape Media.",3

799,Never Lie,"The problem I have with this book is that it's dishonest. If you reread it from the beginning, it doesn't make any sense. The MC is the killer and very familiar with the house, yet when reading from HER perspective in her own thoughts, she acts like she has never seen the house before and it's her first time inside it. Even though she gifted the painting to the psychiatrist, in her own head she acts like she's never seen it before. In her thoughts, she pretends to be suspicious of her own husband even though she knows his past and she also knows that she herself is the killer?This is deceptive and lazy writing.I gave it three stars because I couldn't put it down and read it in less than a day. However, I won't be reading any more books by this author. When I read a mystery/thriller/whodunit, I want the facts to add up in the end. This book has more plot holes than Swiss cheese.",3
800,Never Lie,"3⭐Publication date ~ book ~ September 19, 2022, audio ~ November 8, 2022Page Count ~ 338Audio length ~ 7 hours 21 minutesNarrator ~ , Leslie HowardPOV ~ dual 1stFeaturing ~ dual timeline, snowed in, rich husband, psychiatrist, missing person, mysteryTold in the now by Trisha and in the before by Adrienne with some transcripts thrown in for fun. This approach was a good call to build up the suspense.Adrienne is a psychiatrist and seemed a little cray cray. Trisha was really getting on my nerves being so scared of the house and she seemed a little cray cray, too. Plenty of secrets to go around. Also, if you're snowed in and don't know when you'll be able to get out for food why are you throwing away perfectly cooked eggs?? wasteful.So I am going to put this one in the middle. It wasn't a perfect thriller ~ I liked some things and didn't like some other things. I'm still wondering how the twist didn't dawn on me sooner cuz it's rather obvious looking back. Interesting ending though.Narration notes ~ fine job, but wish I could've sped it up some more without it skipping. Her voice was a little slow and I really wish there were 2 different narrators or some distinction between characters. I'm wondering if I would've enjoyed it a tad more if I read it rather than listened.*Thanks to the author, Dreamscape Media and NetGalley for the advance audiobook.

801,Never Lie,"I have yet to read all of Freida's books, but I can say with some certainty that one words sums them up perfectly.OBSESSIVE.These books will invade your every thought and activity as soon as you start. You will be desperate to get back to the story, as well as constantly thinking about how Freida might put her trademark twist in the story.This latest offering is no different.It truly is the definition of unputdownable. I'd have read it in one sitting had I not been working. And when the twist happened, I gasped, put my hands to my face and gave a bark of laughter. My fiance was concerned and confused lol.The characters are incredibly written, totally genuine and the whole book gave me creepy chills. The house at the centre of the story is so well described I was so freaked out.Freida is a genius. A magician. A music conductor- juggling all the threads with such effortless ease until the wonderful crescendo.I finished this last night and there's a reason I try not to read thrillers late at night- they give me nightmares. I couldn't stop reading last night though, so I have myself to blame for the messed-up, crazy nightmare I had.Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY.",5
802,Never Lie,"I don’t know what Freida McFadden injects into her books seriously, but boy do you get hooked !! Her writing style is additive and I would recommend her books to anybody who finds themselves in a reading slump. They will drag out right out of it and have your full attention right until the very end.Tricia and Ethan are a newly-wed couple looking for a home to one day start a family, but Tricia is keeping a secret from her husband.. She is already pregnant!They find a huge manor home that seems like the most perfect place to Ethan but Tricia is getting bad vibes from the place. It used to belong to Dr Adrienne Hale, a renowned psychiatrist who was the author of some top-selling books. Up until her disappearance, presumed to have been murdered by her boyfriend, Luke. The couple are snowed in the house overnight and the more time they stay there, the more secrets there are to be revealed…Tricia finds some tape recordings in a secret room of some of Adrienne’s therapy sessions with certain patients. In particular, one patient called “EJ”- a twenty-nine year old male that she diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder.As these tapes are played, will it reveal what exactly happened to Adrienne? And who are EJ and the other patients on these recordings?I didn’t see the twist coming here, it definitely wasn’t what I initially thought, but I was allowing myself to become fully emerged into the story without trying to guess.Never Lieis masterfully done.5 stars",5
803,Never Lie,"The Coworkerwas my first read by this author and I loved it, so I was very disappointed that this one didn't work for me at all. I didn't expect that, especially since it has a much higher rating on GR thanThe Coworker.I didn't care about any of the characters, and that has nothing to do with finding them unlikable. The story was repetitive, full of plot holes, very far-fetched, and once the big reveal came, none of the things that happened previously made any sense. That's the complete opposite of what I expect and enjoy in a mystery/thriller.The only reason I didn't dnf the book after all the twists was because I was listening to it on audio.",1
804,Never Lie,"*audiobook*I got cocky after predicting the plot of the inmate, and honestly thought I had this one figure out too. then Frida was like BITCH YOU THOUGHT.",3
805,Never Lie,"You can tell when an author seems to be trying to hit a specific word count. A lot of words like “it’s” and “hasn’t” become “it is” and “has not” and so on. It makes it feel very choppy. Also why do we need entire paragraphs describing turning on a light or other mundane things? Lol …there were also many repetitive inner dialogues. At one point the characters inner dialogue said “this room is about the size of a walk in closet” … then two paragraphs later says “I was right about the size of the room, it’s about the size of a walk in closet” …another paragraph describing a bathtub and letting us know it had separate handles for hot and cold. Suffering through overly explaining the use of putting a tape in a cassette player, “I blow some dust off the tape recorder, then I pick up the tape I found. I remove the tape from the case and shake it out, then slide it into the tape deck. With one quick movement, I push the tape deck closed” …it just gives the vibe of trying to hit a specific word count rather than tell a story that flows.And how many times do we have to hear her tell us her friends think her husband she married that she barely knew has red flags but they are clearly wrong because he’s just “so sweet”? Or how many times do we have to hear that he wants this house and her thinking to herself “nope! Not going to happen!”? How many times do we have to hear that they saw a light on upstairs as they approached the house? We get it!!It’s so hard to concentrate on anything with the juvenile-esque writing style. It would be different if any of the characters were interesting or had a personality, but we don’t have that here either. Unless you count the female MC being utterly vapid as having a personality. Not my jam. I’ve given two books a shot now and am not even a little impressed.If you like books that are repetitive, glaringly obvious red herrings and that lack plot, I have a book recommendation for you!",1
806,Never Lie,"I've heard a lot of great things about this book. It was an OK read for me. Didn't blow me away or knocked me off my feet. It had a small amount of thrill and tension which kept me from quitting the entire thing.A remote manor miles away from anywhere captivated newly-weds, Tricia and Ethan while on a househunting. The castle-like estate once belonged to a renowned psychiatrist Dr. Adrienne Hale who vanished years ago. What they will find inside the mysterious abode is far more than the dream house they are looking for.This was such a quick read. Fast-paced and slightly interesting from the get-go. I laughed a bit because of the ""cashmere"" thing. That one was a little silly for me. I think the main character paid too much attention to a really trivial clothing. Haha.Overall. I don't really get why a lot of people are raving about this. It felt rushed to me. Yes, there were a couple of complex characters but they weren't likeble at all. A lot of twists were easy to figure out because the author threw a lot of obvious foreshadowing.Not giving up on Freida, yet.",2
807,Never Lie,"Never Lie by Freida McFadden was a creepy and suspenseful psychological thriller. It kept my interest for the most part but parts of it were so over the top and almost predictable. I also never developed a real connection with any of the characters and some of the things certain characters did or said made me roll my eyes more often than I would have liked to admit. The chapters were rather short and I did listen to the audiobook in its entirety. I should have figured out the ending way before I did. It was so obvious once I did figure it out. Overall, I didn’t hate it but it was clearly not one of my favorites by Freida McFadden. The audiobook was narrated by Leslie Howard. Sometimes it was hard to distinguish between the different characters but overall the performance was good.Tricia and Ethan were still in the honeymoon phase of their marriage. They recently started to look for homes in Westchester County so they could move out of their tiny apartment in New York City. Their real estate agent had recently sent them information about a new listing. Tricia and Ethan had driven Ethan’s BMW up to the showing. On the way, it began to snow and the intensity of the snow started to pick up rather quickly as they got closer to the house they were going to view. Tricia thought that Ethan had passed the street they were looking for a ways back but Ethan was insistent that he knew just where it was. I thought that was strange since supposedly he had never been to the house before. His instincts were correct, though. The only problem was that snowstorms and front wheel BMW’s don’t do well together. They had to leave the BMW at the bottom of the driveway and the couple trudged through the snow. Of course, Tricia was wearing expensive shoes not designed to wear in the snow so Ethan carried Tricia on his back to the front door. Tricia noticed an upstairs light on in the house but also noticed that the rest of the house was dark. Why would their real estate agent leave a light on upstairs but not turn on any lights downstairs? By the time Ethan and Tricia got to the front door the light was off. Did Tricia just imagine it? There was no sign of their real estate agent. Finding a hidden key to the front door, the couple let themselves into the empty house. When they tried to call their real estate agent to see if she was on her way they discovered that they had no cell service. Tricia and Ethan soon discovered that they were in Dr. Adrienne Hale’s home. Dr. Hale had been a prominent practicing psychiatrist who had just disappeared a little over four years ago. There had been a major investigation about her disappearance. The police believed that her boyfriend had killed her and had disposed of her body somewhere but her body had never been found. Who would enter an empty house without confirmation from the real estate agent that it was permitted? Why didn’t the couple just turn around and find a place where they had cell service to contact their agent and find out where she was?Tricia and Ethan decided to stay in the house until the snow let up. They explored the house. Ethan was sure this was the house for them. It was perfect! Tricia wasn’t so sure. Ethan made himself right at home. He discovered fresh cold cuts and other items in the fridge and proceeded to make lunch for both Tricia and himself. This made Tricia even more nervous that someone else was in the house with them. Ethan even took a shower and helped himself to clothes that he found in the master bedroom. While Ethan showered, Tricia found a bookcase by the staircase. She decided to take one of the books to read. To her surprise, the bookcase moved and revealed a hidden room with recorded tapes of all Dr. Hale’s sessions with her patients. Tricia could not resist. She went to Dr. Hale’s office and over the course of the next few days and nights, she listened to all the tapes. More evidence started to materialize that made Tricia even more convinced that her and Ethan were not alone in the house. Were her suspicions correct? What would she learn from the tapes?Never Lie by Freida McFadden was told from different points of view. Tricia represented the “now” and Dr. Adrienne Hale represented the “ before”. There were many inconsistencies throughout the book. It left me scratching my head and wondering. The ending was quite unexpected and yet based on the rest of the book, it fit. My feelings about this book were in the middle. It was not my favorite but I did not hate it entirely. Some parts just bothered me a lot. I look forward to reading her next book.Thank you to Dreamscape Media LLC for allowing me to listen to the audiobook of Never Lie by Freida McFadden through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.",3

810,Never Lie,"Very good book. There’s lots of murder. Made me glad I am not a therapist or psychologist, because you have the potential to see very unstable people.The only thing that bothered me and took this down from a 5 star is that the very surprising twist didn’t make complete sense. It bothers me when authors have a narrator who is telling the story from their point of view and then suddenly, everything from their point of view is a lie, because that doesn’t really make sense logically. If it’s their internal thoughts, how could it all be lies suddenly unless they have like a split personality which was not the case. I was willing to overlook it this time only because this book was so captivating and there was so much going on and so many surprises.This was definitely a spooky one & there were times I was very creeped out from the suspense. This is a good October read.",4
811,Never Lie,"This book makes me mad, it makes no sense and I don’t understand how the reviews are so high.",1
812,Never Lie,"Wow! That was totally twisted, and I loved every creepy minute of it. I thought I had completely guessed the twist, but the actual twists were unexpected even though the author provided subtle clues throughout the fast paced plot. I enjoyed how the story was told by alternating POVs and the taped sessions of Dr. Hale. I always enjoy how Freida McFadden adds just enough “crazy” to all of her psychological thrillers. This is over the top, extremely suspenseful and utterly addictive. The narrator Leslie Howard expertly brings the characters to life while adding an element of intrigue and intensity. Thank you NetGalley and Dreamscape Media for my audiobook.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5

814,Never Lie,Never Lie by Freida McFaddenThriller | Mystery/Suspense | Fast-Paced- Tricia and Ethan are looking for their dream house. The couple go and look at Dr Adrienne Hales house who has recently disappeared. Tricia finds audio transcripts from Dr Adrienne Hales psychiatric patients after she is trapped in her home with Ethan in the middle of a blizzard. Tricia discovers evidence to explain Dr Hale's web of lies.- I've given up making predictions about what is happening in one of Freida's book. She will always give the unexpected. The ending was jaw-dropping and shocked me to my core. I enjoyed the character development of Tricia (the main character) who proved to me to never trust your first impressions about a person. I am in awe of how the plot is well-thought out. The storyline is intriguing and captivating to the point where it was impossible to put the book down. I am left stunned and scarred. I'm sure you will feel this way too.5/5Thank you Sourcebooks for a copy of this incredible Thriller.,5
815,Never Lie,This was a quick & easy read that kept me captivated the entire time! Just as you think you have it figured out twist number one takes you by surprise and after the first twist they keep coming! Another great book by Frieda! Would highly recommended! ⭐️💛,5

817,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","For all of their faults,The Hunger Gamesbooks a decade ago became a pop culture phenomenon. The brutal premise in a YA book, the surly heroine with a backbone of steel, the motifs of manipulation vs truth, the moral ambiguity, the pain of survival, the lasting impact of trauma — yeah,I loved it shamelessly,warts and all.And then Collins writes a prequel about President Snow. Yeah, *that* Snow.The Emperor Palpatine of that universe(I’m a bit shaky on Star Wars stuff, but I think I got that one right). The absolutely abhorrent embodiment of all evil, keen on sending children to death while oppressing the crap out of the country. So why?Is it a villain origin/redemption story? We do tend to like redemption of villains, the origin stories that explain the eventual slide into darkness. Darth Vader. Joker. Severus Snape. Wicked Witch of the West. So is this book here to show us the tragic slide into villainy, the horror of the circumstances and the Games that eats away at you and taints you until there is not much left? Or is this just a case of innate sociopathy, an early glimpse of the soul that thrives on cruelty?I think this book will alienate quite a few ofHunger Gamesfans.You see, it was easy to root for Katniss pitted against the ridiculous brutality of her world. She spoke to you, the girl who volunteered, the girl who defied her own self-preservation instinct to stand up for what’s right. ButThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakesmakes it impossible to root for its protagonist because he is the ultimate antagonist, because we know what he will become.You don’t root for young Hitler to find love and success, after all.Coriolanus Snow cannot be redeemed. But he can be understood, to a point, and that’s what Collins did well here(or so my sleep-deprived brain after late night bleary-eyed reading believes).I like that Snow is not a born sociopath. He is bright but unlikeable, ambitious, resentful, conceited and very entitled, with capacity for manipulation and ruthlessness. He is slippery like the titular snakes. Buthe has some humanity in him- capacity for friendship, capacity for love, capacity to care and even a degree of sacrifice.The problem is the choices that he decides to make - the choices fueled by his over-developed self-preservation instinct which is by definition selfish. The problem is that you don’t need to be a born stone-cold tyrant — you can choose to become one when you choose yourself above all, when you make the corrupt system work for you instead of choosing to fight it.He chooses complicity— and that’s what shapes him into what he will become by the time 64 years later when Katniss Everdeen volunteers to become District 12 tribute in the horrific televised spectacle of Hunger Games.Snow decides to remain a predator so that he wouldn’t become prey.“So he added a paragraph about his deep relief on winning the war, and the grim satisfaction of seeing the Capitol’s enemies, who’d treated him so cruelly, who’d cost his family so much, brought to their knees. Hobbled. Impotent. Unable to hurt him anymore. He’d loved the unfamiliar sense of safety that their defeat had brought. The security that could only come with power. The ability to control things. Yes, that was what he’d loved best of all.”This is a story of the formation of a tyrant - but the one who understands what makes others rebel, and that, as we know, makes him even more dangerous. No surprise he is behind the whole concept of Hunger Games as a mandatory sickening voyeristic pageantry spectacle.“We control it,” he said quietly. “If the war’s impossible to end, then we have to control it indefinitely. Just as we do now. With the Peacekeepers occupying the districts, with strict laws, and with reminders of who’s in charge, like the Hunger Games. In any scenario, it’s preferable to have the upper hand, to be the victor rather than the defeated.”It’s not a love story, despite the superficial resemblance to it. Snow wants Lucy, wants to possess her, wants her to be his — and wants it onlyas far as it suits his comfort.Don’t think that it ends up being a desperate turn to villainy after the loss of a loved one — that would be too cheap.“His girl. His. Here in the Capitol, it was a given that Lucy Gray belonged to him, as if she’d had no life before her name was called out at the reaping. Even that sanctimonious Sejanus believed she was something he could trade for. If that wasn’t ownership, what was? With her song, Lucy Gray had repudiated all that by featuring a life that had nothing to do with him, and a great deal to do with someone else. Someone she referred to as “lover,” no less. And while he had no claim on her heart — he barely knew the girl! — he didn’t like the idea of anyone else having it either. Although the song had been a clear success, he felt somehow betrayed by it. Even humiliated.”No, there is no redemption for Coriolanus Snow.There is only understanding which at least for me led to even more repulsion.Because he saw a path that Katniss eventually took — and instead forged his own, the easier one, the one of cruel overcompensation for almost not taking it.——————Yes, I can see how it will alienate some long-standing fans.But I am glad I read it. Even if I couldn’t root for anyone.Now I can rereadThe Hunger Gamestrilogy with new eyes, understanding the underpinnings of that horror show better.3.5 stars.“He knew this would be easier if he wasn’t such an exceptional person. The best and the brightest humanity had to offer.”——————Also posted onmy blog.",3

Even though a prequel with Coriolanus Snow seemed a bit like a cash grab, I was still willing to put down a ""soul of my firstborn"" down payment to get my grabby little hands on a copy of this book because I love a good villain origin story.Keyword: good.I think the problem here is that it feels so impersonal and boring. The first three books were all narrated in first person and had tautly written action scenes so everything felt very in the moment and urgent. We see the Capitol from Katniss's eyes as this glittering bacchanalia of conspicuous consumption while she and her people are literally starving and she is horrified that she has to compete to the death for the entertainment of these awful people who don't care whether she lives or dies as long as she puts on a good show. Children, for these people, are just another commodity.Here, it doesn't really work. We already know that the Capitol looks down on the other districts. Seeing Coriolanus bitch and moan about being in genteel poverty while in the same breath whining about how his mentoring Tribute is from the grodiest district doesn't really add anything new to the narrative. And it doesn't help that Lucy Gray is a manic pixie dreamgirl who literally arrives on stage in a frilly ruffled dress, singing stupid songs that take up waaaaay too much of the page count.And if I heard Coriolanus talk about his fecking cabbage soupone more time.I can't. I just can't. RIP my untarnished memories of the original series, because this bloated 500-page mess crapped all over it. I think the author would have been better off writing about the first Hunger Games, or one of the games that took place in extreme conditions (like the arctic one), or maybe about a more sympathetic character, like Haymitch or Finnick. I would LOVE to read about Haymitch or Finnick's competitions in the Games and seeing how they got to be the fucked up and jaded individuals that they were in the books. That is the kind of subtle darkness that I expected from the series. I wish it had panned out with this one, but I was mostly just really, really bored.Date over. And I hope you know, you're paying for that wine, TBoSaS.1 star",1
819,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","I feel absolutely drained by this book.Because I was such a big fan ofThe Hunger Gamestrilogy, I was determined to finishThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, but doing so took a LOT out of me. What a chore this book was! I now understand the disappointed and outraged reviews of others who read it first, but what I don't understand is how those people were still able to blast through this in a day or two. You guys are far tougher readers than I am.I have to confess that I was initially enthusiastic about this book being told from Coriolanus Snow's perspective. I know it put some people off, but one of the few things I love more than a good villain is a good villain origin story. No, I didn't expect to sympathise with him, but could I understand how he'd gotten so messed up and evil? Well, maybe.But... I don't think it works. For so many reasons, but a major one for me is that this book is so boring. So meandering, unfocused, dry. There's a lack of urgency and emotion. A lack of any connection with the characters outside of Snow, who is so self-serving and self-pitying that I couldn't even have fun hating him. I could not understand what we were reading for. I had no real questions that needed answering. This book added nothing to the Panem universe.And the ""romance"" was just downright unpleasant.The plot takes us back to the 10th Hunger Games, where Coriolanus Snow is assigned as the mentor to the district 12 candidate, Lucy Gray (whose songs are the one shining light in this novel). Coriolanus sees this as an opportunity to shake himself free of the hardships of the past and improve his social status. Lucy's potential victory becomes deeply-entwined with Coriolanus's own, and their relationship is a discomfiting mix of romantic feelings and him using her to achieve his own means.But, still, while this is unpleasant, I don't think I am half as bothered by it as I am by how utterly dull the story is. I'm not so refined as to be above some trashy drama, but that's the thing: it's not dramatic. It's lifeless and cold. 90% of the plot exists inside Snow's head. He tells us about the supposed hardships he has had to endure, but we never really feel them. And something about his perspective makes every other character he encounters seem dull also.A few others noted that this book picks up at the end, which is possibly the only thing that carried me through. It does, but I can also say it was far too little and far too late for me. I think the only good thing about my lack of connection with this book is that I can safely say I don't even consider this part of the same universe as the original trilogy. I can now go forget about it.Facebook|Instagram",1
820,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","Only last 20 pages of this book managed to stir my interest. So, is this 1 or 2 stars? If I hate read the rest of it? Okay, I'll be generous. 1.5 stars it is, but there is no way I am rounding this up.The problem withThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakesis that it doesn't know what it wants to be until the very, very end. It meanders here and there, bloated, unfocused, wordy, boring, misguided, treading the same water on and on and on, to the point of tedium. Just to get to the climax where Snow needs to decide if he wants to be good and poor and in love or bad and successful. I kept waiting for some grand twist or revelation to happen. What I got was a tiny splash of excitement after 500 of uninspired blah.There are failures of every type in this novel. Snow's evolution is convoluted, drawn out, poorly paced, and entirely too much time is spent on lingering on his sob stories of poverty, school demerits and cabbage soup. His inner world is neither explained well nor is it interesting. This is not a successful villain origin tale. You will never convince me that it is. Too many new characters are introduced, but none of them are memorable. There is not one person of Haymitch's caliber, or Cinna’s, or Effie's. There is an attempt to show the dawn and messiness of the early Hunger Games, with all the gore and DYI-horror, but it's diluted by the wrong perspective, weird Capitol apologia and a BIG BAD, super-boring first game maker villain. There is a romance that it totally unbelievable and an incomprehensible joke.I literally spent 99% of this book with this expression on my face. (I wish I were exaggerating.) None of what was happening made any sense, especially the romance (gag).I do believe there is a decent story somewhere in this mess of bloated mediocrity, a story that should have been told by Lucy maybe? But as is, this is a massive failure of execution. The pacing is off, the themes are muddled, there is no passion, there is no urgency, there is no heart, there are no stakes. There is, of course, Lucy who was badly underserved. And her songs (too many?). Two potential positives totally wasted on this travesty of a novel.I am not touching this book ever again, and I am going to try to forget it ever existed.A heartbreaking fiasco.____________Not sure I liked this excerpt or the idea of redeeming a monster.

821,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","- i didtrulyfind the nods to the original trilogy fun. finally finding out the origin of the hanging tree song, why snow despised katniss so much from the get-go, how certain features of the games were implemented, etc. was really interesting. that being said, i've seen a number of reviews say that this read like fan fiction, and i honestly kind of agree. the way that every single loose end from the original story was tied up felt a lot like fan service to me, and while as a fan of the original trilogy i gladly ate that shit up, i don't think any of it was a needed addition to the overall world.- snow's character felt like an afterthought in his own book?? I was surprised by what a passive protagonist he was for the majority of the story, and he lacked the detail and nuance that would have made this a compelling character study. while i liked that we got to see how easily he was able to manipulate others from the start, his overall transition from the little, privileged weasel of the first two parts to the actual villain in part three was entirely abrupt and unsatisfying.- the pacing of this was also wonky as heck. the first 450 pages were moving at the pace of a snail (that's a fact, not a complaint. i enjoyed the slower bits more) compared with the breakneck pace of the final 60 pages, i got whiplash.- the ending (no spoilers) but while i thought snow's portion wrapped up way too quickly just as he was getting interesting, there was enough left hanging with *cough* other characters *cough* that i truly wouldn't be surprised if we got a sequel to this story, and idk how i feel about that.not sure what else to say....basically, unpacking more of panem's history was an ambitious idea on collins' part, and i think it could have been done well (maybe as part of a collection of novellas?) but, this book was just far too long and failed to strike a good balance between snow's story and the exposition of the early games.",2
822,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","a lot of people are not going to like this book. it’s weirder and maybe a little...goofier? than the original hunger games. it’s also much more philosophical - almost part novel part contemplation on nature vs nurture and the base instincts of humanity. and it is not a villain origin story like you’ve read before. if you’ve come here looking for a story like the joker where you leave sympathetic to the villain and understanding what moment pushed them to being evil? well, you’ll likely be very disappointed. but if you, like me, have grown frustrated with the narrative that destructive and horrible white men are just victims of society? you might love this one like i do. honestly, i think with this work suzanne is subverting and critiquing the entire narrative of the “villain origin.” house of cards could be a much better comparison to this novel than any villain origin story you’ve watched or read before.biggest complaint and what kept this from 5 stars for me: the pacing is a little off. about 75% in, the novel seems to lose a lot of it’s bite and just sort of meanders (until the end, which is definitely explosive).watch my reading vlog for the ballad of songbirds and snakes:https://youtu.be/hROVNIlYVWY",4
823,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","I really enjoyed the first half of the book and looked forward to how Snow's villain origin story would be pulled off. I was invested in his conflicted feelings about the Games and possessive affections towards his love interest - this set up a really interesting (and juicy!) dynamic, because there's a lot of potential to create a tragic, dramatic, and poignant story there. Unfortunately, the last third of the book bumped my rating down to 3 stars, as I felt very underwhelmed by the outcome and execution. The character development was so rushed at the end; rather than a gradual and nuanced transition to ""evil"", Snow flip-flopped way too many times for arbitrary reasons. The last third of the book also became extremely heavy-handed with all the mockingjay metaphors and the constant singing to basically sum up the entire story. And if you're going to turn to the dark side so quickly and unrealistically for the sake of canon, at least give us a dramatic showdown for entertainment!

Well, the whole purpose of that was to prep myself for reading this book.- The problem is I forgot, lost urgency and it got lost in the shuffle.- I'm sure most people here know the feeling, when you buy a book, you either read it straight away or it sits around on a shelf until you're in the mood again.12/26/2021- Chapter 1(1) I don't like that Collins uses poverty to make Snow sympathetic.- Feels cheap to me.(2) Snow's cousin's named Tigris. I wonder if this is the same Tigris from ""Mockingjay""?- If so, it'd give her scenes there added meaning.(3) Snow's family is bankrupt nobility, a contrast with his school rival, Sejanus, who's family is nouveau riche.- Such a very Victorian trope. Odd to see outside of classics.12/27/2021- Chapters 2-6(1) Dr. Gaul, the Head Gamemaker, is inclined to speak in rhyme... frequently, not all the time.- Might as well call her Dr. Seuss.(2) Familiar names keep popping up. I assume Arachne Crane is related to Seneca Crane and Hilarius Heavensbee to Plutarch Heavensbee, for example.- How very ""Harry Potter.""(3) 100 pages in, and I'm not feeling the urgency of the original books.- Sort of reads like fan fiction.12/28/2021- Chapters 7-10(1) There's a lack of distinction among students. All the names are too alike, exotically Roman, and easily confusable.- Contrast this with ""Harry Potter,"" where student names were distinct, a bit stereotypically ethnic but distinct nonetheless, and gave an impression of appearance and voice.- I'm having difficulty telling Clemensia from Lysistrata and Persephone. Make note of different hair color, at least!12/29/2021- Chapters 11-13(1) Whenever Coriolanus frets over the possibility Lucy, or Tigris, aren't as chaste as he naively presumed, I hear Britney Spears singing: ""I'm not so innocent!""(2) This is turning out to be quite the Jane Austen romance.- Well, except for all the murder... and explosions... and allusions to prostitution... and ritual humiliation... did I mention murder?(3) Tigris like to eat raw meat.- A bit on the nose.12/30/2021- Chapters 14-16(1) Of course, being an Ancient Rome analogue, this society unsurprisingly has their own variation of public crucifixion.- 20' high poles with a crossbeam sounds remarkably similar to American football uprights.(2) It's a running joke that very few people in Panem actually know the national anthem.- Possibly a commentary on indifference to national unity in the Capitol: anthems being symbolic of nationhood.01/02/2022- Chapters 17-22(1) Collins seems to only know how to write one kind of female lead.- Practically perfect in every way, who boys pine after.(2) About 60% in, and it's a totally different book.- It could have just ended there, and the rest could be Part 2 of a duology.(3) Oh no! They're not doing what I think they're doing to link this to the main series!- No spoilers, please.(4) How very ""Game of Thrones"" Night's Watch.01/03/2022- Chapters 23-24(1) The whole book I wondered why Lucy Gray Baird was called ""Lucy Gray"" while everyone else is referred to by their first name. Apparently, her first name is ""Lucy Gray"".- It isn't a double-barreled surname, her people have double first names, with the second a common surname.- Something that could have been explained 250 pages ago!(2) The romance is going too well. I feel like tragedy's around the corner.01/04/2022 (1)- Chapters 25-28(1) '""Hey, you found some katniss"" ... but [Lucy Gray] immediately examined the roots, from which small tubers hung. “Little too early yet.""'- How awfully meta.(2) Less than 50 pages from the end, and I still don't know what to think of this.- By now, books would be in tidying-up mode, but what appears to be the climax doesn't feel built up enough to cap off this book, it feels like the end of a second act.01/04/2022 (2)- Chapter 29-Epilogue(1) Yeah, I just finished the book and I still don't know what the heck to think about it.- Whereas ""Mockingjay"" similarly required time mull over its ending, it was a much more exciting book, punctuated with action. This, on the other hand, was slow throughout and ended with a head-scratcher.(2) On the bright side, the thing I dreaded would happen because of the midpoint plot twist, didn't end up happening.",3

832,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","As much as the idea of a whole book dedicated to the mind of President Snow reviled me, I knew this book would be as excellent as it was!The most captivating piece of the book is in the early development and psychology behind The Hunger Games. It’s a fresh angle. We get to see Capitol citizens living in a post-war redevelopment stage, in which they’ve actually experienced starvation and fear. They have not yet been lulled into complacency regarding the depravity of the games. I loved reading the moral based arguments that eventually abandoned themselves for a fear-conditioned dependency on the power structure between the districts and the Capitol.Without Coriolanus Snow, we would only have been able to read about this time through a newly made-up character. As loathsome as Panem’s president is, it was a brilliant and logical choice to write from his perspective.It was fascinating to think of the Games before they were a huge production fueled by gambling, showmanship, and style. The classic arena with tickets, turnstiles, and viewing boxes and the delivery of the victors like livestock in a cattle car. The games of the past are the same as the games of the future, only played out on a smaller, more openly brutal and inhumane scale. No prize but survival, no posh meals (or food at all), no elegant outfits, no interviews, no tokens, no training, and no mentors. Until the 10th Hunger Games.The mentoring system begins with students of the Capitol’s Academy, Coriolanus Snow being one of them. Several of the Capitol students bond with their tribute and mourn their death. This obviously eventually gives way to the Victor-Mentor system, because there has to be division between the Capitol and the Districts to continue the “eternal war”. One of my biggest questions in the original trilogy was always how none of the Capitol citizens objected to the televised murder of children. But seeing the early stages and development of the games through the eyes of manipulated Capitol teenagers makes the 75 years of terror plausible. Fear begets fear, hatred, and a desire to control. Some Capitol characters are even lovable, despite their willful ignorance.A few such lovable characters are Tigris and Lysistrata; compelling characters with moments that at least hint at un-Capitol opinions on The Games. Or at least a sadness over the lost of certain tributes and a recognition of their humanity. I also liked Clemensia although she wouldn’t feed Reaper, because her storyline was so intriguing to me. She experienced the snakes and their aftermath first-hand and knew what it was like to be afraid for her life the way the district tributes did. The scene where she and Coriolanus turned the paper in to Dr. Gaul was actually my favorite scene, because I enjoyed the slow, dreadful dawning of what was about to take place in the snake habitat. And of course, Sejanus Plinth. He was too good and too gullible. I loved when he broke into the arena to sprinkle the bread on Marcus’ body, but I wish he’d died there so that his end didn’t have to hurt so much.President Snow’s character, thankfully, is hardly ever lovable. Even his best moments are manipulative and calculated. Collins does a great job of creating charmingly insincere interactions between Snow and his acquaintances/friends/enemies that showcase his desire to protect and advance his status at all costs. His need for control and order is highlighted not just through his sadistic additions to the games, but in his relationships. He constantly refers to the girl he ‘loves’ possessively - as his girl, and is fraught with jealousy concerning her ex beau that she expresses no continuing interest in. As much as you pity his circumstances, and are impressed with his ambition, he would be distinctly unlikable even without the foresight of his future in The Hunger Games Trilogy. You root for him to make the right choice, while knowing he won’t.Snow’s snake-like charm made it difficult to love Lucy Gray by association. She was a very unique character that I found well-developed, but had a hard time identifying with. I think having insight to Snow’s character makes it hard to support any girl that finds him lovable. It makes her seem naive and foolish, although she was being played like Master of Puppets. I appreciated that she values trust more than love, and that realizing Coriolanus’ lie is what caused their fallout. I like to believe she was clever enough to get away from Snow and escape to the north! Since the book is from Snow’s perspective, he has to believe that she’s most likely dead, and we get to believe that she’s now a hopefully less dystopian, Canadian free bird.I loved the tie-ins to the trilogy. I loved getting to learn The Valley Song that made Peeta fall in love with Katniss and the origins of The Hanging Tree. It was interesting to read about a District 12 that was free to go the meadow and the lake and free to play music in the Hob. At certain points I felt like there were too many tie-ins to be realistic, particularly in the mirrored figures of Lucy and Katniss, but I appreciated the sentiment all the same. Despite their relationship as protagonist and antagonist, you get the sense that Katniss and Snow understand each other. They do agree “never to lie to each other” and hold true to that agreement. But seeing her through Snow’s eyes - as a sort of reincarnated Lucy Gray - justifies that understanding. Her name alone brings him back to a time at the lake with Lucy. The songs she sings are Lucy’s songs. Her defiance, her talent, her “star-crossed love” as ill-fated as his own. Her mockingjay pin and Peeta’s frosted cookies, both tokens of his betrayal of Sejanus. The parallel of Snow giving the snakes Lucy’s scent in the arena to protect her and giving the snake-mutts Katniss’ scent so they could hunt her to her death was wicked cool. All brilliant... but almost too brilliant to be believable. Seeing Snow in all of Katniss’ old haunts felt more fan-service than authentic.It’s never clarified, but in my mind, Snow’s old penthouse becomes the training center. This is based off nothing except my wild imagination and maybe some strategically reminiscent verbiage? The Snow family lives on the top floor - the same floor that might eventually be where the District 12 tributes stay. There’s also a flat roof with a garden, very like the one where Katniss and Peeta spend some secluded time. And Coriolanus and Tigris both mention an elevator several times, which gave me déjà vu to when Katniss first rides the elevator in the tribute center and almost asks Effie if they can ride it again. Especially because selling or repurposing the Snow family’s ancestral home would provide another reason for Tigris’s hatred of her once loved cousin. Yes, I know lots of buildings have penthouses, flat roofs, and elevators. There’s no proof, but I like the theory and I’m sticking to it.Anyway, all this to say I loved it. It was a great read and it made me want to reread the trilogy which I just read a month ago. Thank you, Suzanne Collins!",5
833,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","A newBookTube Video is Upall about whether you should buy, borrow or burn 2020 YA books! Let me know what you think!The Written Review“Well, as they said, it's not over until the mockingjay sings.”Coriolanus Snow, future president of Panem, is just eighteen-years-old in this prequel to the Hunger Games trilogy.He is one of the Snows - a once mighty house in the Capitol but now is on the edge of desolation.He's desperate to preserve the image of his family and find a way to claw his way back to the top.Then, the unthinkable happens.Coriolanus's graduation is now tied to the Hunger Games.You can blame it on the circumstances, the environment, but you made the choices you made, no one else.He's been given the girl from District 12 (Lucy Gray) to mentor and must find a way to bring her to the top.Despite her being wholly and completely below him (after all, she'd district)...he finds himself drawn to her and her light.Nothing you can take from me was ever worth keeping.But there's darkness within Snow, a darkness that he's willing to embrace to get what he wants. And no one - not the Capitol, not his friends, not even Lucy Gray - better stand in his way.Snow lands on topWow.Guys, gals, people of all genders - wow.I wasBLOWNaway by this Hunger Games prequel.So many prequels feel like completely and utterly unnecessary additions to the lore...but this one? I think it worked really well.It added to and expanded the Hunger Games series - giving somemuch needed insightsto the origins of the Hunger Games.It was MB to watch these cruel humans design new muttations and calmly discuss the best way to wring out emotions (and participation) from the outer districts.I alsohated and loved Snow. There's no doubt that he's an AWFUL being. Like completely and utterly terrible.And yet, I was glued to him.I never truly emphasized with him (cause, hello, he was appalling) but he was riveting to watch and provided such an interesting perspective.There were a few loose ends that I wished were tied up in the end but overall, I really enjoyed this return to the Hunger Games - and am crossing my fingers for more!YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads",5
834,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","review to come---Its astonishing that I've managed to avoid spoilers for 3 years. All I'm hoping for is that Collins doesn't give Snow a redemption arc. Let me hate him in peacePre-read theories:My theory about our mysterious tribute is that it could be an ancestor of Madge, the mayors daughter who gave Katniss her mockingjay pin. Madge said the pin belonged to her aunt who (we then find out in Catching Fire) was Maysilee Donner, a tribute during the second Quarter Quell (aka the 50th Hunger Games).The pin has been in the family for a long time. But how long? Could it be from all the way back to the 10th Hunger Games even?OR is this mysterious tribute the other one that is mentioned in book 1? Katniss said that district 12 has only had two victors before and that besides Haymitch the other one died. Could it be her?",4
835,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","Reread 2023: I decided to pick this up after watching the trailer for the film. Still really enjoyed it.Original review: From what I have seen from early reviews, I'm in the minority for this one - but I really enjoyed this. I can understand the criticism, and perhaps the argument that this isn't particularly necessary, but there's just something about this world and its set up that manages to suck me in every time.Following Snow as a main character was always going to be a bold choice. He's not likeable or redeeming in anyway, and I think many people will be put off by this as he's often hard to connect with on an emotional level. He's selfish, ambitious, proud and generally doesn't care about anyone unless he can get something out of having a relationship with them - whether this be power, money or advancement in society. When he becomes so taken with Lucy Grey it comes as surprise at first, until we see just how unhealthy their relationship is. His perception of love is so skewed from the norm that he believes he possesses Lucy. He owns her like an extension of his property and her success in the games can only lead to more success for him. He doesn't really want her to be free.His relationship with Sejanus Plinth is another complicated edition to the story. As the son of a wealthy former District 2 entrepreneur, Snow is obviously jealous of the boy at the start of the novel. While Snow must keep up a persona of class, and uphold the Snow name while secretly wollowing in poverty, Sejanus is frequently bought his way to the top by his powerful father. But Sejanus is almost the opposite of Snow. He's a romantic, a believer in goodness and putting the world to right. Fairness and equality. Everything the Hunger Games fights against. He's also incredibly annoying to Snow, constantly throwing him into situations he has no intention of being involved in. But he's the only friend he has.I was also delighted to see the history and revisit some of the well known places of the Hunger Games. The story builds and expands on the lore well, intrinsically linking the stories together from the past. There are the ghosts of Katniss and Peeta throughout the story in the form of Lucy's songs, the tree by the forest and the mockingjays - a creature Snow instantly hates because of their obvious subversion from the Capitol dream. It was interesting to see the backstory of the games, its purpose and development beyond dumping a bunch of children in an abandoned arena with weapons. By instilling interest into the event by involving the citizens of the Capitol and engaging the psychology behind it you encourage its continued existence and validate the violence. Especially when you combine the idea of the games with a leader who is clearly a psychopath (looking at you Dr. Gaul) by adding in mutts to kill your tributes in fun and colourful ways.The writing has improved immeasurably too, when compared to Collins previous novels. On a base level the story is simple, yet you can delve a lot deeper into the philosophy of human nature, war and the constructs of political dominance and the effect on society. Why do the Hunger Games persist? What is their purpose and what are the consequences for the people who live in the Capitol and districts? I found it thought provoking.I understand the complaints, but any trip into Panem is a winner for me. Coupled with an interesting, morally grey lead and machinations of power and corruption with crazy professors who mutate snakes and bunnies to kill and you're onto a winner for me.",5
836,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","”Being a hero at home had its limitations; he needed a larger audience.”So,“The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes”made it into the “Goodreads Choice Awards 2020” and is probably one out of 3 books I actually managed to read this year. *lol* Taking a closer look at all the reviews that have been written about it, I have no idea how it ended up as a nominee in the awards but I suppose the main reason why it made its way in there is because it’s popular and provoked very conflicting emotions. I mean, all publicity is good publicity, right? ;-)I can see why so many people didn’t like it. The expectations for this were probably sky high and if you expected something similar like“The Hunger Games”it’s no wonder people ended up hating the book. As for me? Well, I went into this completely blind and all I knew was that it was going to be about President Snow. And tell you what?! I enjoyed it immensely! XD This book was right up my alley and the carefully hidden Dark Court faerie in me was a happy camper! ;-P (As was the part of me that loves to collect hints that are linked to the main trilogy.)Yes, Coriolanus Snow is neither a hero nor an especially likable person but he’s cunning and knows how to use his strengths. I loved all the machinations and lies, the countless manipulations and the back-stabbing attitude of the tributes as well as their mentors. It kept the story going, it forced me to take a closer look at some of Coryo’s classmates and it helped me to understand Snow a little bit better. Mind you, I still hate him! *lol* But you can enjoy a book and still dislike its protagonist. ;-) So if you’re looking for a slow book whose focus is on the art of schemes, I’m pretty sure you’ll enjoy this. If you’re looking for action and a good redemption arc, well, I’m sorry to say it, but you won’t get it in here. This is no story in which the heroes win; it’s a murky, morally grey and ambitious tale. And it ends with:“SNOW LANDS ON TOP.;-PThe characters:You’re entering the Capitol! Make sure to leave all your good intentions at the front door because you certainly won’t need them in here. Be prepared to read some spoilers and to discuss them with our host Lucky Flickerman! Don’t say I didn’t warn you! Once you enter this spoilery arena all bets are off!Coriolanus Snow:”I keep asking myself why you did it.”Not much choice, really, thought Coriolanus. “He’s my friend,” he said.I have so many mixed feelings about this boy! On the one hand there were moments I could relate to him and on the other hand he did a lot of things I didn’t agree with. To say he’s a fascinating character would be the understatement of the century. Is he good? No! Is he bad? No. If anything Coryo is one hell of a multifaceted character and I’ve to give Suzanne kudos for managing to make him this way. So who is Coriolanus Snow while he’s the mentor of Lucy Gray Baird in the 10th Hunger Games? He’s a boy driven by the will to survive! The lengths he’s going to just to ensure that his family “stays on top” are kind of remarkable. I mean there’s a boy who knows hunger, who has nothing but his family, a fancy apartment and his good name. War hardened him, showed him his limits and taught him that sentimentality has no bearing once you’re faced with the decision to either burn your beloved books or to freeze to death. Still, while his cousin Tigris is working hard to keep food on their table, Coryo’s job is to attend the academy’s classes. All in the hope that he’ll become big and earn them enough money to keep them afloat. That’s the boy at the beginning of the book, but the longer I followed his journey, the more it became apparent that he’s also an exceptional egoist and opportunist. Everything he did was calculated, every move he made was deliberate. All of his actions had an ulterior motive, even if it was as simple as not to anger Dr. Gaul. This boy is trying to survive and as long as the end justifies the means everything is allowed! The most fascinating thing for me was the fact that Coriolanus knew Dr. Gaul was trying to manipulate him into a certain direction, but that he still decided to let himself be formed by her. It was way easier than to swim against the tide and to lose everything. There were so many road junctions, so many different routes he could have taken, yet he always, ALWAYS chose the one that made life easier for him. Even if it meant to betray his friends. In the end this led to him being the perfect pawn in Dr. Gaul’s game and it eventually culminated in the poisoning of Dean Highbottom. His first real and intentional murder; the very first cobblestone that paved the way for his cruel future. Well, I don’t know about you, but I think Dr. Gaul won in the end!”He buried his head in his hands, confused, angry, and most of all afraid. Afraid of Dr. Gaul. Afraid of the Capitol. Afraid of everything. If the people who were supposed to protect you played so fast and loose with your life... then how did you survive? Not by trusting them, that was for sure. And if you couldn’t trust them, who could you trust? All bets were off.””He’d continue the Games, of course, when he ruled Panem. People would call him a tyrant, ironfisted and cruel. But at least he would ensure survival for survival’s sake, giving them a chance to evolve. What else could humanity hope for? Really, it should thank him.”Lucy Gray Baird:”You can’t take my sass.You can’t take my talking.You can kiss my assAnd then keep on walking.”I absolutely loved Lucy Gray Baird! She was one hell of a girl and I couldn’t help but admire her for her strength. She was scared and alone, but she still refused to back down. Some might say she’s a survivalist and that would be true. In contrast to Coryo she still has compassion and a good heart though. I think those two were pretty similar but what distinguished them were their different moral concepts and convictions. Coriolanus was like a wind chime always going in the direction of the least resistance without regretting (most of) his decisions while Lucy Gray had to do horrible things in order to survive and despised herself for them. She had to do those things to stay alive, but she neither enjoyed doing them nor did she accept her situation as an excuse. Quite the contrary, she didn’t excuse her actions; she lived with the harsh reality of them! Maybe it was her being a part of the Covey that helped her to get through the Hunger Games. I mean she was exceptionally resourceful and she knew how to work a crowd. Both qualities that worked in her favour. And let’s be honest here, the fact Coryo fell for her gave her an undeniable edge over the other tributes as well. He cared for her wellbeing, gave her food and helped her to avoid the deadly poison of the snakes. Guess Lucy Gray Baird might not only have been sassy and charming but also a little bit manipulative as well. ;-PDr. Gaul:”How quickly civilization disappears. All your fine manners, education, family background, everything you pride yourself on, stripped away in the blink of an eye, revealing everything you actually are. A boy with a club who beats another boy to death. That’s mankind in its natural state.”Dr. Gaul is one of those characters you can’t help but despise. She has no regard for life, or at least not as long as it isn’t useful for her purposes. This woman was ruthless and cruel, using her position in order to threaten, bully and hurt the people that got in her way. The handful of mentors she took an interest in all either ended up dead or were sent on their way to madness. For her the tributes were as much a part of the game as their mentors and she saw them all as tools. I don’t know why but for some reason the picture of Tilda Swinton in “Snowpiercer” always came to my mind when I thought of Dr. Gaul. *lol*It just seemed to fit her personality and the weirdness of her character. The thing that happened with Clemensia?! Oh boy! Dr. Gaul was one hell of a manipulative witch and it’s no surprise Snow turned out the way he is now after ending up under her tutelage. >_<Sejanus Plinth:”They’re not animals, though,” said Sejanus. “They’re kids, like you and me.”Sejanus Plinth was too precious for this world and that’s exactly what cost him his life in the end. He was too trusting, too compassionate; he saw the tributes as people and not as animals like everyone else. Sejanus was brave but also so very innocent and naive. I think he underestimated the power, wiliness and cruelty of the people he was dealing with. On the one hand that made him braver than any of his classmates but on the other hand it also painted a target on his head. Someone like Sejanus had no place in a world like the Capitol and I think the only three people to ever realize this were his mother, Coryo and yes, unfortunately also Dr. Gaul. I think Sejanus was an idealistic dreamer and I really liked him for it. But dreaming will only get you as far and he didn’t have the necessary slyness to go about things the right way. It pained me to see where his way was heading but as a reader there was nothing I could have done to stop it. Which is another reason why this book was so intriguing. It made me pull for him, but at the same time I knew he wouldn’t make it.”The only thing I loved about the war was the fact that I still lived at home. If you’re asking me if it had any value beyond that, I would say that it was an opportunity to right some wrongs.”The relationships & ships:Coriolanus & Lucy:”You’re not alone.” He took her hand. “And you won’t be alone in the arena; we’ll be together. I’ll be there every moment. I won’t take my eyes off of you. We’ll win this thing together, Lucy Gray. I promise.”I really think those two loved each other. The way they fell in love might have been pretty fast but considering their circumstances I think it was realistic. I mean Lucy could have died any second and Coryo’s life was dangerous as well. Not to mention that they were both very young and at least for Coriolanus it was his first love. If he wouldn’t have harboured real feelings for her he would have never even considered giving her his mother’s compact. It was, after all, his most precious possession. This said they barely knew each other and never had the time to spend all too much time in each other’s company. It’s no surprise they didn’t work out in the end; I’ve to admit that I was sort of thrown by the events at the ending of the book though! I mean OMG!!! After everything they went through together he actually wanted to kill her... just like that?! O_o But that’s Snow for you. He was always way too practical for his own good and he saw an opportunity to get the life he dreamed of. Lucy was the only obstacle left in his way so his logical conclusion was that she had to go. I’m glad Lucy was so smart and figured it out before he got a chance to kill her, but I’ll always wonder what happened to her. Maybe Katniss is her descendant? Who knows?Coriolanus & Sejanus:”The one thing Coriolanus had never questioned was Sejanus’s honesty. If anything, he’d have welcomed a little less of it. But this was a bald-faced lie, delivered as naturally as the truth. Which meant that now anything he said was suspect.”Was it friendship or not? I think everyone who read this book might have asked themselves this question at some point. I think it was and then it wasn’t. The only reason Coryo saved Sejanus so often was because he would have probably died if he didn’t. I mean it’s not like Dr. Gaul gave him any choice in that matter. For Sejanus it was definitely friendship, he trusted Snow and considered him to be his best friend. For Coryo? I think some part of him actually cared about Sejanus, but it just wasn’t enough to put his friend before himself. When faced with the choice between his or Sejanus’s life Snow would have always chosen himself. And he did it in the end. He knew exactly what he did when he sent Dr. Gaul that voice record and even though he tried to reason with himself he ultimately knew that he had made the wrong choice. He knew about the consequences, no matter how hard he tried to convince himself into believing that he didn’t and yet he still did it. What really struck me as tragic was that nothing would have happened if he would have let Sejanus disappear with the rebels. I mean all they planned was to run away and to seek refuge in another district. So why did he do it? An ingrained sense of duty? To curry favour with Dr. Gaul? Aside from that he had absolutely no reason to turn on his friend. So if you ask me it was some combination of stepping over his friend to get where he always wanted to be and some twisted kind of payback for all the times he got into trouble because of Sejanus. That’s just my opinion though. If you have another theory: Hit me! I’d love to discuss this! XD”He had killed Sejanus as surely as if he’d bludgeoned him to death like Bobbin or gunned him down like Mayfair. He’d killed the person who considered him his brother. But even as the vileness of the act threatened to drown him, a tiny voice kept asking, What choice did you have? What choice? No choice.”Dr. Gaul and Sejanus:”Possibly on his way to freedom,” said Sejanus in a strained voice. “Possibly captured and under wraps. Possibly injured and hiding. Possibly dead. I’ve no idea. Do you?”Honestly, I was kind of impressed that Sejanus was able to defy Dr. Gaul for so long. That boy had guts to stand up to her like that and to question her in front of his entire class. Truth be told I was surprised she didn’t shut him up immediately, but then again he probably was another one of her experiments. She enjoyed to be challenged by him and for a while it seemed to amuse her. Also she would have had plenty of opportunities to harm him but she chose a public executionAFTERthe Hunger Games in a district that was so far off that no one even noticed. Talk about revenge. Dr. Gaul got her payback alight. >_<” I don’t care what you say. You’ve no right to starve people, to punish them for no reason. No right to take away their life and freedom. Those are things everyone is born with, and they’re not yours for the taking.”Conclusion:Since this was Snow’s story I didn’t expect to be all too invested in it, but the more I read the more I was intrigued by the book.“The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes”was definitely a surprise in this regard and I don’t regret picking it up. Backstabbing, cruelty, machinations and complex characters, this book has it all. I can recommend it to everyone who can’t help but appreciate a well-crafted and thought-provoking intrigue. ;-P",4
837,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","1.5 starsI went into this cautiously optimistic because although I was not pleased that we were following Snow... I thought Suzanne wouldn't do us dirty like that right? WRONG. She absolutely did.My biggest complaint with this story is simply that it didn't need to happen. I didn't care. I didn't want to know any of the information I was told in this story. Snow's backstory does not make him more interesting or compelling. In fact, it makes him less so.The story forces you to follow this character whose ending you already know. Even with that, he has no character arc. He doesn't really change throughout the story. So you are forced to read about him being awful but not realizing he's awful for 500 pages. And while I don't think the story romanticizes him in any way, you still are forced to suffer through it. Also, the games themselves are more brutal because the Capitol has yet to figure out how to make them into the spectacle that they are in the trilogy, and I just didn't need to see that brutality in fiction when I have to see it in real life in 2020.AND HE HAS A ROMANCE! puuuuuke! A romance with a character who has very little agency and who he makes his own personal manic pixie dream girl. She would have been far more interesting to follow as a protagonist. Actually, a number of the side characters would have made much better protagonists for this story. ANY NUMBER of other stories from this world would have made a better story!The extra .5 I gave this book was that it's not horribly written and there are a few ""easter eggs"" for things in the original trilogy, how things got to be the way they are, etc. But I still don't care about those things and could have done without learning them.WHY WAS THIS WRITTEN?!?Anyway, I have a vlog of my reading experience coming up so you can see my immediate reactions.",1
838,"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (The Hunger Games, #0)","| |blog|tumblr|ko-fi| |It's a yikes from me.Did the world really needThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes?I think not.Full of unnecessary exposition and weighed down by self-indulgent fanservice,The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakesis a train-wreck of a novel. The story lacks rhyme or reason, things happen only to advance the plot (regardless of whether they make sense because what is even logic?), there are no stakes (Coriolanus having to eat cabbage soup and not being able to pay taxes are hardly sources of tension), the characters are ridiculous and one-dimensional, frequently the writing veers into the ludicrous, and the author doesn't trust her readers to reach obvious conclusions by themselves.Having recently re-read the Hunger Games trilogy, I was reminded of how good a writer Collins is.One of the strengths in THG series lies in Katniss' first person narration which brings immediacy and urgency to her story. In THG Collins' exploration of the ethics of violence and the conflict between survival and sacrifice struck me as being both nuanced and intelligent. There was also a certain ambiguity that allowed, nay encouraged, readers freedom of interpretation.Which begs the question...Collins, what happened?The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakesmay be the prequel to THG trilogy, but it's an altogether different beast. Which would have been fine by me if it had been 'different but good'. What we have instead here are simplified discussions about human nature (are we inherently bad? Do our circumstances shape who we are ? Are we responsible for what we do in order to survive?), an unconvincing story that is dragged-out for 500+ pages and is populated by goofy characters.The novel strives for depth, yet its attempts to address the nature/nurture question and other moral quandaries result in a clumsy and overt parable that is leagues from being a satisfying or insightful philosophical inquiry into human nature. An example of this would when Dr. Gaul assigns Coriolanus Snow and other mentors homework along the lines of: “Write me an essay on everything attractive about war.”What follows is a predictable and cringe-y scene in which they express their different opinions (shocking I know). Was that the only way to include a discussion on the ‘positives’ of war? It seemed a desperate, and rather pathetic, attempt to throw into the story some 'serious' material. Just because the characters who are talking about these things have ancient-Roman-sounding names that doesn't make their conversations any more meaningful or thought-provoking.Not only does the character of Dr. Gaul exist to tick the 'mad scientist' box (I will get to her in due time) but she's also there so she can explicitly ask characters 'challenging' questions regarding their moral and political tenets. So subversive and illuminating is she that she says things such as: “Who are human beings? Because who we are determines the type of governing we need” and “What happened in the arena? That’s humanity undressed. The tributes. And you, too. How quickly civilization disappears.”We also have characters like Sejanus Plinth who although District-born has spent the last few years in the Capital, and he comes out with: “You’ve no right to starve people, to punish them for no reason. No right to take away their life and freedom.”. Did this guy just suddenly realised what kind of world he lives in? After years of Hunger Games he's like 'nah, that's wrong. Humans should be free.' (as if he doesn't know that his words will have consequences?).Away with Plato. Move aside Nietzsche. Sontag? Get out of here. There is a new philosopher in town.Corny philosophising aside, the writing was weighed down by obvious statements which made the characters seem rather simplistic. Worst still we have cheesy gems such as “you’re mine and I’m yours. It’s written in the stars” and “although he didn’t believe in it, he tried to channel her telepathically. Let me help, Lucy Gray”, or witty descriptions like “The cabbage began to boil, filling the kitchen with the smell of poverty. ”What in the world? I'm supposed to take this seriously? The writing exudes wattpad energy.The third person narration didn't do the novel any favours. Most of Coriolanus' thoughts and feelings aren't articulated so that his character is given no new depths. Collins' shies away from portraying him as a truly morally corrupt yet self-delusional person, making him into a not very convincing 'he's not that bad' kind of guy. He's an orphan who is tired of eating cabbage soup and not having money. Boo-hoo. His personality is just so tepid...he's sort of ambitious, sort of a liar, a 'sort of' kind of person. Look, I wasn't expecting the next Ripley or Humbert Humbert but Coriolanus is such a non-entity. While the narrative makes it seem as if he's this cunning and charming guy, Coriolanus' no Machiavelli. His elitist views are exaggeratedly rendered, so much so that they make him into a caricature of the contemptuous heir. Even those scenes in his family apartment or the ones where he's with Tigris or Lucy Gray did not make Coriolanus any more believable or sympathetic. His 'arc' as such was merely motivated by his desire for wealth. As the descendant of a powerful yet crumbling Aristocratic family he believes he's entitled to more than just cabbage soup for dinner. And of course, he hates Sejanus because 'new money'.From the first chapters characters are classifies as either good or bad. Throughout the course of 500+ pages they don't change. Their thin personalities remain fixed.Because of this the cast of characters is entirely forgettable. Although their names may appear on a page, their personalities remain largely non-existent. Coriolanus' fellow students and mentors....did they even possess an individuality ? With the exception of holier than holier-than-thou Sejanus, these ill-defined Academy kids soon morphed with one another. What they say or do matters very little. They are mere accessories to Coriolanus' story (we get it, although they have been indoctrinated to believe that the Districts are scum, they are not entirely entirely desensitised to violence or cruelty).Lucy Gray was just so ridiculous. She seems one of the few random characters to have a normal name, and yet there was something comical about the way a 'distressed' Coriolanus would shout out her name. While the narrative did seem now and again aware that she was treated as an object, the way she’s depicted seems to corroborate this. She just didn't convince me as an actual human being. At times she seemed a twelve year old Marie Sue, at times she seemed to have walked off the stage of a musical, and yet we are meant to find her intriguing?The adult characters are unintentionally funny. From the 'deranged' Dr. Gaul (who speaks only in cliches and is not at all intimidating) to Dean Highbottom (whose surname merely brought to mind Neville Longbottom) who for some reason I don't care enough about doesn't like Coriolanus. These two, similarly to the other characters, do not leave their assigned roles (in this case 'the mad scientist' and 'the bitter guy who for reasons holds a grudge against the protagonist').The characters in this novel are clownish. They have wannabe-Roman names, they speak in clichés and come out with uninspired maxims.The world-building relies on readers having read THG. Which is weird given that this is not a sequel.Panem is a dictatorship because reasons.The novel also has a weak sense of place. The Capitol is barely delineated. The Academy is a building, Coriolanus lives in an apartment, and the Hunger Games take place in an arena. The architecture of these places is obviously irrelevant. Who even cares about descriptions of the characters and their environment? (I do).Minor spoilers aheadOne of the first things that did not seem very rational was that the Capitol assigned the tributes to eighteen-year olds. Sure, the childhoods of these Academy students were marred by the war, but in comparison to the tributes, they've led a fairly privileged existence. But however rich their education may be, they still lack experience. They have little insight into the entertainment industry and just because they've discussed war strategies doesn't mean that they could give any useful battle tactics. One thing is theory, the other one is practice. Yet, we are supposed to believe that the powers that bedecided that this particular group of students will mentor the tributes for the upcoming Hunger Games. The reason for this 'mentorship' is to make the Hunger Games more popular, garner some extra views or I don't know. To me this seems an ill-conceived plan.Anyway, let's go along with it: mentor=more entertaining Hunger Games. Okay, so why am I meant to believe that the same people who are working extra hard to make the Hunger Games more interesting would let the tributes starve for a few days in a zoo cage? So they can collapse and die as soon as they enter the arena? Why even bother with the mentors then?! It was quite clear that the only reason why the tributes end up in a zoo cage is to remind us readers that to the 'civilised' citizens of the Capitol, District people are less than 'animals'.There were so many scenes like this. They did not make sense but they are theatrical. Characters are attacked, killed, and or tortured for effect. For all she writes about violence and human nature, Collins' will often sacrifice believability for exaggeration. The whole thing with Dr. Gaul and her snakes was laughable. She's such a crudely drawn figure that it was impossible to feel intimidated by her actions. The violence in this novel seems closer to that of splatter film.The Hunger Games themselves are not only boring but they are described in a yawn-inducing way. The games section reminded of how in THG films they occasionally showed the game makers watching Katniss to make up for the fact that in the book we had Katniss' narration to fill the moments of 'quiet'. There was something so impersonal about these Hunger Games that I really did not care to see the way they would unfold (we know who is going to win anyway).Shockingly enough, I struggled to finish this novel and ended up skimming a few pages in the final section. I'm baffled. What is this mess? What was it trying to achieve? It adds nothing to the THG. Coriolanus is not nuanced nor is he believable. If anything he seems a very different shade of evil to that of President Snow. We still don't know much about the war. We get it, the Capitol suffered at the hands of the 'rebels'. Collins' tries to make this particular Hunger Games more significant by making characters come up with ideas that will be implemented in the following Hunger Games (like the sponsors or whatnot). For some reason Collins' has to 'foreshadow' later events or can't help but to reference mockingjays (“the show’s not over until the mockingjay sings”) and 'the hanging tree' song. What was the point in Tigris? She had a small cameo in the ...why try to make her ‘important’? Especially since her role in this prequel in pretty irrelevant.With so many pages did we really need to have passages in which earlier conversations reappear in italics? Why not trust that your readers will be able to remember what Coriolanus is referring to?Last but not least: I am so done with the ‘muttations'. They were the weakest aspect of THG trilogy and to dedicate so much page time to them is just...Moral of the story: approach prequels with caution.my blog/ /my tumblr/ /buy me a coffee",1

(that's the one I eventually settled on, after spending half the book mentally mumbling her name) I mean, what in Erilea kind of a name is Celaena? Is it really any wonder that Nehemia eventually renames her?! Other people get normal enough names, such as Dorian and Grave and Sam and Elena and Xavier and Cain and Philippa and Verin and Ned; simple names, really. I guess the special snowflake needs a special name to go with her very special personality impairment. Don't even try to get me started on the place names, because I tuned them out after Eyllwe, so I have no idea how these countries / lands / coffee beans relate to one another, but I'll probably live.And what is even the point of the glass castle?

If you ask me, the author should have gone forCinderella in Candyfloss Land!, because you certainly don't get much more than that. I don't even know what Celaena spends most of the second half of the book doing. The tournament trials and murders are mentioned in passing here and there (Yesterday we threw knives! Another three people were eaten over the past three weeks!) and the book focuses on - I don't know what - Celaena sitting in her room, Celaena fawning over herself in front of one mirror or another, Celaena boasting about her amazing assassin skills that you'd otherwise never know she had, Celaena going for walks, Celaena admiring pouffalicious dresses,CinderellaCelaena wishing someone would invite her to the ball, Celaena eating sweets, Evil King being evil, and Frolicking Unicorn being high.

842,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","It feels likeThrone of Glasshas been a book I've been thinking about maybe reading for a million years. The reviews and ratings from my GR friends on this book are very mixed and I can easily see why after finishing this entertaining but disappointingly tame and romance-y young adult fantasy.Throne of Glassis likeShadow and Boneround two. The premise is awesome for both: full of hardcore warriors/assassins, royal/noble secrets and scandals, a touch of magic... but each one, though entertaining, quickly hangs up its weapons and becomes far more concerned with dresses, bitchiness and whether or not that sexy dude thinks the MC is hot (he does).This book is to the fantasy genre whatTwilightis to vampires; though I have to stress that it is a fast-paced, compelling read and Maas does tame fantasy as well as it can be done. Despite my frequent eyerolls and disappointment at the romantic turn the story took, the pages seemed to fly by. I tend to read several books at once; I'll spend a few chapters with one and then mix it up by moving on to another, butThrone of Glassmanaged to hold my attention from start to finish with no time for interference from another book. This, in itself, was quite an achievement.Celaena Sardothien is the star of this show. A former assassin turned prisoner, she spends every day in the salt mines prison of Endovier. Having given up on hoping for freedom, she wishes only for death. That is, until one day The Crown Prince (Dorian) and his Captain of the Guard (Chaol) arrive with a proposition for her - fight in a competition, win, become the King's Champion for four years, and finally earn her freedom. It's an offer Celaena can't refuse. But, of course, things aren't that simple. Some dark evil is at work inside the King's castle; something that is killing off the competitors one by one. Plus, there's the handsome Prince and moody Captain to deal with too.I don't think Celaena is in the King's palace for a day before she starts obsessing over her looks, her new dresses and whether or not either or both of the aforementioned men find her attractive. She still manages to have more badassery than Alina inShadow and Boneand the book is, in my opinion, nowhere near as boring asGrave Mercy. But, still, I couldn't help being like ""BUT you said ASSASSIN!"" when she's there swanning around in front of the mirror. I like that she's ""feminine"" (whatever you want to take that to mean) as well as a brutal killer, but there's only so much high school changing rooms behaviour I can take. I think there's an excellent quote, a question that Celaena wonders to herself, that basically sums up what was running through my head for a lot of this novel:""How had she gone from the most feared prisoner in Endovier to this sappy mess?""How, indeed. But, that being said, I really enjoyed the banter between her and Chaol. And Dorian wasn't bad either. I've said it before but I'll say it again for the benefit of this review: I actually don't mind love triangles when they're convincing and both candidates for the MC's heart are on equal footing so there's some tension over who they're going to end up with. Though I may have to do all kinds of evil things - like... stomping around my bedroom angrily or letting library books become overdue - if Celaena doesn't end up with Chaol. Ms Maas, you've been warned.So, yes, I will be readingCrown of Midnight, god help me. I'm hoping it will please me more than the sequel toShadow and Bonedid, but the ending of this does make me think the second book could have more action and nastiness (yes!). I think you can enjoy this book if you go into it knowing exactly what you're letting yourself in for. It isn't high fantasy. It isn't mind-blowing. But it is kinda fun *grins*",3
843,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","Madre mía, ¿por qué no he leído esto antes?Por fin, y después de casi diez años, me he puesto manos a la obra con el primer libro de la sagaTrono de Cristalde Sarah J Maas. ¿Me arrepiento de no haberla comenzado antes? Rotundamente sí. Qué pedazo pistoletazo de salida para una obra tan grande, y qué de sorpresas me he llevado… Venga, vamos por partes.En líneas generales,considero queTrono de Cristaltiene un buen ritmo.No recae demasiado en descripciones pesadas, porque si lo hace es usualmente importante en algún momento más adelante. Hay unmuy buen equilibrio entre la duración de los capítulos, las escenas, los diálogos, momentos de introspección de los personajes y momentos de acción.Creo que está todo cuadrado al dedillo y hace que te sumerjas en la historia sin ninguna complicación.Celaena es un PEDAZO DE PERSONAJE.Enamorado de ella desde el primer momento, en serio. No solo es decidida y se la sudan completamente cosas como la monarquía, sino que es despiadada, sangrienta, extremadamente inteligente y curiosa, y la mejor asesina del reino.Es brutal.Sin embargo, también tiene su corazoncito, y ese punto de inflexión en su personalidad me ha terminado de encandilar.Personajes como Nehemia, Dorian o Chaol construyen un universo alrededor de Calaena que me fascina.Cada uno de ellos está muy bien definido, conectas con ellos, sus emociones y sentimientos, y creo que todos aportan algo a la trama de una manera u otra.Quizá he echado de menos más personajes como Nox, es decir, campeones de la competición con los que Calaena se acercara, pero lo que aportan personajes como Nehemia creo que lo compensa de sobra.El estilo de Maas no es nuevo para mí. Ya había leídoUna corte de rosas y espinas.En este caso, sin embargo, me ha entrado más fácil por los ojos. No sé si es porque es su primera novela, pero no creo que sea tan rimbombante como lo es en ACOTAR. Va más al grano, perono deja en ningún momento de escribir con esa pluma tan característica de la fantasía épica(con esto me refiero desde a uso del lenguaje a estructura concretas). Todo un acierto. La misma historia escrita de otra forma no me habría gustado tanto.Respecto a la historia...DAMN GURL!No me esperaba para dónde iba a ir la novela. Me encanta todo el tema de persona elegida que va a una competición a destacar, que es un tropo o cliché bastante visto. Sin embargo, los momentos donde se comienza a incluir magia o historia ancestral del universo donde se desarrolla la historia...Gloria bendita.Menuda sorpresa.Se me eriza el pelo pensándolo, porque no me esperaba para nada que la historia realmente tratara sobre eso y que se vaya a dirigir hacia ahí.Sé que esto es tan solo una introducción, pero estoy deseando ver hasta dónde puede llegar, porque de momento estoy fascinado.Creo quela autora presenta los elementos necesarios para comenzar a dibujar un imaginario sobre el universo creado,desde la magia hasta criaturas o leyendas antiguas, dinastías monárquicas y casas, relaciones de poder, estratos sociales o incluso economía y política. Plantea todo de una forma sencilla, fácil de captar, para desarrollarlo más profundamente en las siguientes entregas.Agradezco que no entre a trapo con esas cosas y que se centre más de momento en el personaje principal y los secundarios,porque creo que una historia sin buenos personajes, pues chica, me da igual. Así quewell done.Y bueno,el triángulo amoroso...Mira,nome ha disgustado. ¡Para mi sorpresa lo he disfrutado! Creo que las dinámicas no solo entre Calaena con los chicos, sino entre ellos mismos están muy bien pensadas y contadas.Todo es justificado y creo que Maas no peca de enamoramientos a primera vista o cosas extrañas que podemos ver en otras novelas juveniles del estilo.Las relaciones y romances parecen surgir con delicadeza pero de forma natural, y es algo que he agradecido enormemente. Deseando estoy -al igual que con la magia- de ver cómo se desarrolla.En definitiva,Trono de Cristalme parece una espectacular manera de comenzar una saga de fantasía tan extensa como esta.Me ha sorprendido y superado mis expectativas. De hecho, cerré el libro y de seguido abríCorona de Medianoche,la continuación.",5
844,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","4.45/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺I am an occasional liar. I don't lie often, but when I do lie, trust me, I might pass as a lie-detector scammer, don't test me, I'm ruthless. But in general, I prefer to be brutally honest and direct. That's my true nature.Today, I could've easily lied and said that I've wanted to read this book,Throne of Glassby Sarah J. Maas, for as long as I remember, but I’ve chosen to tell the truth instead: two months before actually reading it I’ve heard about this book and it didn’t appeal to me, mostly because of the cover somehow?? I know, I am a hypocrite (don’t judge a book by its cover, remember?), but the cover itself has (in my opinion) a crucial role in my own personal pick of a reading. And this particular cover felt like it wanted to intimidate me so bad.I actually tried to readThrone of Glassonce before, earlier in the year, and I managed to stop after preciselytwo words, change my mind and read something else. I don’t know what got into me then, but I dropped it like it’s hot, really.But boy was I wrong because I actually enjoyed it and it was VERY readable.I can’t say that I particularlylovedany of the characters, at least at the beginning. They all seemed to be so stereotypical that I quit trying to bother: the narcissistic prince, the oppressed heroine with a shady background, the wicked king scared of magic, the hard-core right hand of the narcissistic prince, the misogynistic brute etc., etc. But as the plot developed, I started liking this hard-core gorilla bodyguard with the name of Chaol, this narcissistic prince with a flirty nature, but with a real love for knowledge, this oppressed heroine which made a name for herself, but preferred to use it just to cover herself because that was a choice she could make.To be completely honest, the most beautiful relationship of them all is the one between Celaena and Princess Nehemia of Eyllwe. Their friendship is so pure and so natural that it seems like their souls have been friends since the moment the world was created. If I’d had to truly ship someone, I’d ship them both, because, let’s be real, they are, on their own, passionate, dedicated and strong women, but together, they make the perfect team. As I heard some lady in a bus saying once: “Us women are stronger when we stick together” and yes, it is so true and so accurate for Celaena’s and Nehemia’s situation too.There are two important things about a book:it has to teach you somethingandit has to help you escape your own reality. I don't know about you, people, but I read books in order to escape my own cruel reality (because that is the reality – a cruel and devious lifetime lasting wake-up call) and I recently discovered that fantasy books are the best remedy for an ordinary life. There is another life to live in a fantastic story, whenever the presented world is amazingly constructed and erected before our mind’s eye.To claim that and also deep, 7-D characters with some serious wisdom passages attached to the neatly done plotline is totally just a whole load ofbull, if you’d pardon my fluent French.I, for instance, do not judge a book by the lack of one of those aspects, but I judge it by the way it makes me feel and by how wholesome it is as an entity (and by its cover, of course!). This is maybe why almost every time I find something positive that I liked in a book that contributes to my general opinion about it. And this is also the case for this one!As the plot develops, the storyline becomes more and more intriguing until it reaches a point where things turn out dark and fantastic. What seemed to me at the beginning asokay-ishturned out to be, towards the end, a great, imaginative story. I am beyond happy that I was wrong! (That means the book is good because I rarely am wrong and I even rarely admit that Iwaswrong!).Celaena Sardothien, world’s best assassin, proves everyone that, after all, no matter how hard life beats us down, we must raise our head high up and keep fighting, because we all are beaten down by Life, but not all of us show this the same way:“We all bear scars, Dorian. Mine just happen to be more visible than most”.P.S. I gave it 4.45 because I feel that the other books of the series are going to get better and better 🙂",4
845,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","Once again, it seems like I'm in the minority for this book because I didn't like it. It's such a shame too because I'd heard a lot of good stuff about it. Oh well, maybe it's just me...or maybe because this book just plain sucks.Let's start off with our protagonist, Celaena who's the""greatest assassin in the world.""Okay, I'm cool with that. But it'd be nice if she could actually prove it because from what I've seen, she's once hell of a crappy assassin. People walk in and out of her room all the time when she's sleeping and she just keeps on snoring. Hello, aren't you supposed to spring awake like a ninja and hold a knife to that person's throat?That's what I expect from someone who just left a death camp. Instead I get this.The real clincher is what I call the 'Candy Incident'. There's a bag of candy left on Calaena's bed with no note or anything. This is during the period where a murderer is going around killing Champions and a couple have died already. And what does the'greatest assassin in the worlddo? She gobbles them up immediately, goingOh, how I adored candies!Remember that episode in Avatar: the Last Airbender when Sokka drinks cactus juice and gets all high? Then, it wears off and this happens:Couldn't have said it better myself, Katara. Calaena is the kind of idiot that licks stuff off walls, even without the hallucinatory assistance of cactus juice.But wait, there's more! Nothing happens to her because she's purrrfect and fabulous, like that song from High School Musical.In fact, I'm pretty sure she's a Mary Sue. Let's check off her traits, shall we? Tragic past, check. Pretty, check. Amazingly good at something, check. Has more than one love interest, check.Don't even get me started on theloveinterests.There is absolutely no difference between Dorian and Chaol except for the fact that I'm more leery of the name Dorian. Maybe it's because I just recently finishedThe Picture of Dorian Grayso whenever I see his name, I think of this:It could be me but then again, you wouldn't name your kid Lolita, would you?And the endingwhere Calaena breaks up with Dorian because she's the King's Champion and it would beinappropriate? We all know it's a ploy to squeeze in some kissy-kissy time with Chaol in the next book. And by beingsingle, she doesn't look like a cheater.On a side note, I saw this took 10 years to write because it was originally published on FictionPress.net or something. Seriously? It took George. R. R. Martin to that long to writeA Game of Thronesand look what he came up with!And this is Calaena's world:My review of Crown of MidnightMy review of Heir of FireMy review of Queen of Shadows",1

847,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","Sorry, but it looks like I've been excited for NOTHING. After enticing me with its promises of a reading experience reminiscent of Megan Whalen Turner and George R.R. Martin, Throne of Glass ultimately let me down. Having been excited for this novel for weeks and actually liking the sample I read, I have been brought back to earth now – with a jolt. This YA fantasy is a rather sorry example of its genre.I have the notion that a big part of this book did not work for me because of its heroine. Celeana is smart, athletic, talented and beautiful. She loves music and reading. She is fluent in different languages. She is great. And she knows it. And rubs it in your face repeatedly. As do her suitors and admirers. I had the feeling that Sarah J. Maas tried everything to make me love her heroine. How do you make readers love someone? Present them with a book lover! But somehow, she accomplished the opposite. I did not loathe Celaena, but she grated on my nerves. I wished someone would tell her off, would for once not grant her every wish; I wished the characters I liked would not fall for her charms and good looks.The little romance Celaena had (I won't say with whom) was laughable at best and mostly resulted in me rolling my eyes at the fact that the only attraction that existed between those two stemmed from them both being beautiful.In terms of plot, I cannot deny that there was always a level of suspense present. I did want to know how this story ended, and yes, there were actually parts when I feared the whole thing would not end well – partly because my beloved heroine did not deem it necessary to inform certain people about what she had witnessed in the castle. Overall, though, the story remained a tad too juvenile and simple for me. Important events were mentioned only in passing and the mythology did not go any further than what was important for the main story line. Many things remained unsaid – doubtlessly for the sake of sequels yet to come – but it was not the subtle way of remaining unsaid but hinted at I love in fantasy novels, it felt more like remaining unsaid to lure me into reading on.There were aspects I liked - Celaena's friendship to Nehemia, the Eyllwe princess, and Chaol, the loyal and fierce captain of the guard – but in the end, there isn't enough to make me interested in reading any sequels.In short - what I wanted: A less is more mentality. World building that does not only cover what is necessary to follow the main story arc. Subtle romance. Villains in different shades of grey. Assassins that actually assassinate. And do not only sit in their room talking or thinking about clothes and boys. What I got: A vain and mostly unlikeable heroine. Two men absolutely bedazzled by her presence. Hints of a love triangle. Lots and lots of descriptions of clothing. Flimsy world building. An overall poor execution writing-wise. Thank you. Next?Thanks a lot to Netgalley and Bloomsbury for the review copy.",2
848,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","First cover:""Yeah, don't I look badass in this? Wait, hold on, does my hair and makeup look okay? I think I need to pose like this, so I look all strong and tough.""Second cover:""Fuck off or I'll end you.""I still stand by my opinions on the covers. I never liked the first cover, and am infinitely grateful that they changed them for the sequels. But as far as how Celaena herself is? I would say she's a bit of both. I feel like these covers portray two very different extremes, and Celaena seemed to possess a quality from each of them. That's actually what I loved about her. She's fast becoming one of my all-time favorite YA heroines.I'll admit that a long while ago, I hadn't expected the book to be this good. But as soon as I read the prequels, I fell in love, and I definitely have high hopes for this series.",5

After a year, however, she is given an opportunity: If she wins a contest to become the king's champion, she will be granted a four-year contract, working as an assassin for the empire she hates, at the end of which time she will be freed. After reading the premise of the book, I thought, ""Sign me up!"" After the first chapter, I knew I was in good hands. This book has plenty of mystery, magic, humor and romance -- a perfect brew for fans of good YA fantasy. If you liked Graceling, Grave Mercy, Shadow and Bone or other fantasies featuring strong female protagonists with scary good skills, I think you'll enjoy this quite a lot.

I CAN'T DECIDE JUST YET!I decided to reread this book, as I am about to continue on with the series, finally!I did really enjoy this the second time round, but found myself a little more critical of a few things.

853,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","I really enjoyed this book. The characters were well formed and excellently developed. There are recognisable and enjoyable twists on the classic Cinderella. Example Celaena Sardothien's fairy godmother is a ghost of an ancient warrior queen. There are also slight touches, such as Celaena having an innate charm with animals.I was also very impressed with the pacing and evolution of the story. Honestly, the 406 pages just seem to fly by. Just because Celaena was the greatest of assassins after being in a death camp for over a year, she needed to capture her old form, but her skills are still intact. Also, I like the way the author plays with her feelings. Even though she is an assassin, she is still very young and prone to her feelings and ego getting hurt.The book does leave a lot of questions, many of which are for the second novel, but as much as I hate prequels, I will have to read the backup stories on the Kindle version. I can't wait for the next book and am really looking forward to what is going to happen next. Like I said earlier this book was more about Celaena recapturing her old form and claiming a position of power, also setting up her side cast, I am expecting a lot more action in the next book after all the training in this book.",5
854,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","I hateread a chapter from book five of this series with a friend. And I'm going to register my opinion that while it may haveslightlyimproved in character development or worldbuilding or etc etc etc - I wouldn't know - it is, objectively,just as horribly written as this book.And that's the tea.🌺 montage of me screaming ""why is this hyped"" for five hoursLet me give this book one minuscule fragment of credit:the plot isn't horrible.Okay, yeah, the plot is kind of boring and there are a lot of opportunities for deception and badassery that are not taken. I take full offense at badassery being missed.But seriously, guys, this book suffers from fuckingterriblecharacter work.Thesis Statement:Celaena is a badly written character.She is arrogant as hell, really petty, and somewhat obsessed with her own appearance. Andthat'snot even the problem - a horribly unlikable assassin as a lead character could be amazing. But Celaena doesnothave enough character depth for her unlikability to be tolerable. Her alleged tragic past? Pretty much not represented on page. Frankly, tragic pasts need alotof fleshing out to be compelling and believable, and I don't even think Celaena's trauma is acknowledgedoncein this book - come on, at least do the bare minimum?Listen, okay, you want to get me started on my #1 pet peeve in YA for all eternity?Heroines that have less sense than the audience. I like my heroines to be one step ahead of me, or at my level. Let's talk about the fact that Celaena is just... a complete idiot.Some assassin. I am 98% sure I have more sense than this character / prop for love triangles does. Like, I'm sorry, but how am I supposed to be intimidated by someone who 98% of the audience could outthink?I am so disappointed by all this character could have been and all this character is not. completely lighthearted. Again, that could be super enjoyable to read about! I'd LOVE a book about a slightly unbalanced girl who murders people with a smile on her face. This could be Celaena if she were cleverer and a bit - okay, a lot - more fleshed out. But she's just an unbelievable, annoying heroine.And Jesus,I am so annoyed by the love triangle. Dorian is just flat as hell and has no character. Chaol is... okay, I know someone is going to fight me over this but I do not care.Chaol is an overprotective ass. I can't believe he's supposed to be the good romantic interest compared to Rowan. Jesus, how bad is Rowan? What is happening in this damn series??And yeah, I forgot just how much I hated it until the hateread, but the writing style of this book is worse than amateur. It is so tedious, it is so typical, and it issooverdramatic. I take full issue with both overuse of exclamation pointsandlack of ability to truly get into a character's head.I have made my decision and I am not continuing.Blog|Goodreads|Twitter|Youtube",1
855,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","upon reread, i am going to bump up my rating. knowing how the story plays out over the span of 7 books, its allowed me to view this with a different perspective and im able to appreciate this more than when i started the series for the first time.what i thought was simplistic storytelling, i now see humble beginnings. what i thought was lack of plot, i now see subtly laid foundations. and what i thought was a predictable ending, i now see necessary building blocks.i think this will still remain my least favourite book in the series (which really isnt saying much) but its nice to know that i enjoyed this more than i did the first time, if only for sentimental reasons.↠4.5 stars",5
856,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestEdit: Lost a few friends over this book, so on it goes to thebooks-that-made-me-lose-friends shelf, where it can party with my feminism and anti-Trump reads. #NeverthelessSheKeptReviewingSarah J. Maas is basically the Taylor Swift of books:they are both among the most well known (if not THE most well known) in the genres they create work for, and have cultish fan bases that believe they can do no wrong. And both, in my opinion, are over-hyped.I originally started THRONE OF GLASS three years ago. I hated it, and wrote a scathing one-star review of it filled with swear words and vitriol. That original review was actually deleted by me, along with about 3000+ books I rated and reviewed between 2009 and 2016, for a variety of reasons,which I discuss here(and will touch on as well at the end of this review). I originally planned to read and review the entire series, but the first book put me off so much that I never attempted the series again - until now.I hadsomany people ask me to review this book series that I decided I might as well give it another shot. I try to keep an open mind when I review books, and even though I'm very critical and snarky, I try to be fair as well. I was also feeling somewhat optimistic, too, as two books that I fully believed I would hate due to what I viewed as excessive hype -THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGOandTHE CRUEL PRINCE- actually ended up becoming some of my favorites.Spoiler: THRONE OF GLASS did not end up becoming my favorite.Although honestly? I didn't hate it as much this second time around. I still didn'tlikeit (and the hype escapes me), but I've read so much worse. THRONE OF GLASS does have some things in its favor: an interesting world where, like POISON STUDY, magic has been suppressed and outlawed, and using it is punishable by death; likable secondary characters (Nehemia <3); and fairly decent writing that, at times, can be lyrical (at other times, cheesy - but hey, I'm a lover of bodice-rippers, so sometimes that pompously-written purple prose has a time and a place: just ask Rosemary Rogers and V.C. Andrews). Also, speaking of bodice-rippers, I loved that Celaena was reading some in her room, cheesy prose and all. Based on the writing, ittotallysounded like a Johanna Lindsey viking novel.So, let's talk about where this book wentwrong.*draws in a deep breath and inflates like a balloon*Reason #1:The heroine. Celaena is aterribleheroine. She reads like the self-insertion character in a fanfic. She has all the boys, all the powers, all the talents - and none of the characterization or skills to back it up. It got to the point where I would roll my eyes every time she admired herself in the mirror and listed off her features or humble-bragged in the narrative about how beautiful she used to be until she wasted away in the stupid salt mines. Whenshe'snot doing it, the two love interests are doing it for her, either while pining outside her window (seriously), pining over her playing the piano like Christian Grey did while watching from a shadowed corridor (SERIOUSLY), or pining over her looking up all tragically at the sky while being carted away to her ""terrible"" fate (OMG).What makes this evenmoreirritating is that she is supposed to be a strong female protagonist, and yet she is basically the total opposite. Not only is she incredibly vain and arrogant, she's also a total jerk. She insults everyone around her, especially the people she shouldn't be insulting (read: the people who are in charge of her fate and could send her straight back to those salt mines with a flick of their wrists) andother women. Celaenalovesto slut-shame other women, especially in the beginning.I mean, how can you like a heroine who says stuff like this?""I hate women like that. They're so desperate for the attention of men that they'd willingly betray and harm members of their own sex. And we claim men cannot think with their brains! At least men are direct about it""(70).Andthenthere's the fact that she doesn't really live up to the ""assassin"" part of her attributes until the very, very, very last possible moment of the book. For the first however many pages there are in the ebook edition that comprise the first 85% of the book, Celaena will telleveryone who will listen(well, everyone who knows who she is) about how deadly she is, and in the narrative she's constantly making stupid makeshift weapons out of hairpins and soap (!), but she never gives me the impression that she's someone who's particularly qualified. People sneak up on her all the time, and she isn't a light sleeper because on several occasions she wakes up, surprised to see someone standing over her.And then. Andthen. There's this line:""Candy!"" A large paper bag sat on a pillow, and she found that it was filled with all sorts of confectionary goodies. There was no note, not even a name scribbled on the bag. With a shrug and glowing eyes, Celaena pulled out a handful of sweets. Oh, how she ADORED candy!(234)This is probably the stupidest moment in the entire book because in Celaena's competition to be the King's Champion, someone is killing off the other competitors. Also, one of the Tests they did shortly before this one involved poison. So obviously, someone wants her dead and even more obviously, there is poison lying about somewhere on the premises that someone could probably steal (if they didn't already steal some from the competition).And it never once crosses her mind that someone might have dropped off a batch of poisoned candy to her bedroom knowing her insatiable lust for sugar. Never. Once. Crosses her mind. I face-desked pretty hard at that. How do you come back from that?Reason #2:It's boring and slow AF. This book is very back-heavy. Not much happens until the end of the book. You would think that a competition between a bunch of thieves, murderers and soldiers for a high-ranking position in an evil kingdom would be exciting, like, the Medieval Times' version of THE HUNGER GAMES. But no, these scenes are vastly overshadowed by much more important scenes. Like Celaena going to the library. Celaena debating about how much sugar to add to her oatmeal. And Celaena looking into a mirror and admiring her fiftieth sparkly, low-cut dress.I liked the scene with the poisons. It kind of reminded me of that scene in Harry Potter, when Harry has to go through all of those trials before he faces down Voldemort (that, and the flying keys). The Tests had the potential to be so much MORE, and it was so frustrating to read about all this pointless stuff when what I wanted was action, adventure, and showmanship.Rule #3:Book-pandering. One of my biggest pet-peeves is when authors make their characters love books in an attempt to get us to like them + to add ""character"" or ""personality"" where there is none. Liking books is not a personality trait, please, and thank you. This is something I mention inMY LADY JANE, as well - a book, incidentally, that I disliked a lot more than this one. There's nothing wrong with writing a character who reads, but when it's theironlyhobby and seems like it's just an excuse to give people quotes to make them go, ""OMG! I TOTALLY RELATE! SQUEE"" it feels cheap. That's just my personal opinion, but it bothers me a lot, so I'm mentioning it.Chaol and Dorian were fine. Chaol had the personality of a fence post, but he had that tall, dark and brooding vibe down that I'm a sucker for, although Valek from POISON STUDY did it better. Dorian is the typical womanizing bad-boy rich-boy stereotype, and I didn't care for him much at all, especially what with his ""you're not like other women"" attraction to Celaena. Boy, bye.Nehemia was honestly my favorite character in here. She's powerful, cool, mysterious, intelligent, and courtly - basically everything Celaena was not. I also think it's ironic that Nehemia and Celaena had much more chemistry than Dorian and Choal did with Celaena combined. Too bad this wasn't an F/F fantasy romance. I would have totally shipped them. They were cute together. Celaena was almost tolerable when she was with Nehemia. *coughs*Almost.I honestly felt bad for Kaltain - probably because it felt like we were supposed to hate her. But hey, I was tired of Celaena, too, so I can't really blame her for wanting to be rid of  Lady Special Specialton, Eater of Suspicious Candies and Bragger of Little Merit. She was honestly one of the more tragic characters in here, and her narrative ARC reminded me a little of Anne Boleyn's. Ambitious women are rarely treated well in YA, particularly if they're sexual and/or beautiful. THRONE OF GLASS does its damndest to distance Celaena from such ""unlikability"" by making her childlike and sexually inexperienced, which I found extremely irritating and boring.I can't really remember why I hated this book so much when I first read it. Maybe because I went in expecting more, whereas this time I knew what to expect? Or maybe because I've read several particularly awful books this year that made this one seem better by comparison? I don't know. But this time I actually found some redeeming facets of the narrative that made me sigh and go, ""Well, I suppose it could have been worse - and I did like this thing and that thing, so there."" The funny thing is on my first review I got all these irritating comments telling me that if I read the book again more carefully, if I even really read it at all (omg, how dare u), I wouldlove it. Condescending comments aside, I did actually ""like"" the book more this second time around, although I still think it's pretty bad (although I'll be trying to give the other books in the series a shot because damn that curiosity).Lastly, since this book has so many passionate fans, I would like to issue a caveat:If you leave me rude comments, I am going to delete these comments and block you.It is not personal and it does not mean that I hate you, or harbor any ill-will towards you.I just have zero interest in interacting with people who don't distinguish between criticism of a book andad hominemattacks of an individual.Part of the reason I deleted all my reviews back in 2016 was because I was getting a lot of nasty comments on about five reviews and I made the novice mistake of arguing back with them and giving them that satisfaction of a response. I've grown up a lot since I first started using this site and now have little interest in arguing or fighting with people. I would rather spend my time and energy on writing snarky reviews or having positive interactions with my friends and followers.In sum, THRONE OF GLASS was not a very good book in my opinion and at times was incredibly annoying. I have heard that the second book has more action and fight scenes, and since those were the parts of this book that I enjoyed the most, I will be reading CROWN OF MIDNIGHT soon (probably this week) to see if it's enough to compensate for the glorious bore that is Celaena.I did have a lot of fun posting snarky status updates for it, though. ;-)Also, this meme I made w/ MS Paint for my status update of THE BLADE ITSELF seemed relevant.1.5 stars",2
857,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","3.5-4 StarsYeah, I know. I’m the last fucker around to read this book. But I saw the whole series in spiffy hardcover on sale at Costco and so, of course, Iresponsibly bought only the first one to make sure I liked it before buying morebought the whole damn series in one go because, well, no impulse control.But anyway.This was fun. I liked it. I look forward to the next one.Which is good.Since, as I said, I already have the next one, and the one after that...Oh, and#TeamChaol",4
858,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","We each survive in our own way.This is going to be a rather personal review becauseThrone of Glasstook away a week of my life and my SJM virginity.I wish I’d let it wine and dine me, first.At least, I’d still have the good memory of a nice six course dinner.It’s not like I have a problem with this book, but…I do have a problem with this book.A couple, actually, and they mainly involve the writing and a certain main character which I won't name for now.Now, before I start, I must say that I’ve been forewarned by a lot of readers that this is probably the weakest book in the series and that the writing is a bit quirky, because at the time, the author was young and (I suppose) unexperienced. I can see that. I actually could see a writing style development between the first and the second half of the book.This to say that, since from the beginning, I didn’t expect much.But since I’m here do discuss books and not to dig into the author’s background, I’ll admit I’m not a huge fan of the writing. Too many exclamation points!!!!!!too much self-indulgence in the characters descriptions and actions, and, definitely, too much walking around the edges.Sometimes I like it when a bookshowsits contents rather than shoving them explicitly into the writing as to say “hey, here’s how you’re suppose to interpret said emotion and fact”, and so on.I don't like that, nuh-uh.Plus, most of the time, it really looked and felt like a thirteen-year-old fangirl wrote a fanfiction based on scratches of books she's seen her big sister read.The plot is not bad. There’s magic and princes and the right amount of stabby-stabbing.Not bad, but not breath-taking, either. I'm not giving up, though, because I trust my fellow readers and I believe it when they say it's gonna get better.Well,Now, another thing that threw me almost completely off the Throne of Glass Train, was the main character, Celeana Sardothien.Oh, boy. I had such a hard time with this one.Not only I didn't connect with her and her way of thinking before the very last chapters, she's also made it into my Top 3 of most annoying characters thanks to her immaturity.I think only America Singer fromThe Selectionand Zoey Redbird fromMarkedcould top that, and this is saying a lot.She’s like that popular chick in high school who thinks she’s head and shoulders above the others. She’s like Regina George with daggers and an even snarkier holier-than-thou attitude.Basically Celeana in every single line ever:For someone who's supposed to be a deadly assassin, she's pretty weak and dull. I get it that she's a girl who likes being pretty and wearing nice clothes and dating hot boys (I actually love it when a female character can be girly and badass at the same time), but she's just so narcissistic and stubborn, she never (or rarely) speaks without thinking first, that you can't help but put aside her best sides and focus on the tooth-cringing ones. Sometimes, she really lacks tact, not to mention good manners, and, for the most part, she walks around feeling like she invented the concept of being a badass. I’ve got news for you, Cece. You still have a lot of road ahead.So flipping frustrating.Sure, she had her good moments, I actually appreciated her spirit and braveness in many occasions, but they were rare and ephemeral enough that they couldn’t have overcome the flaws even if Batman himself joined the collab.I really hope she’ll redeem herself, or at least, grow some sense into that little superiority complex-affected brain of hers.To be completely honest, sometimes I even enjoyed this book, but I couldn't help but notice they were chapters or paragraphs in which Celeana was silent or absent or too busy fighting for her freedom to care about other stuff.Ahem, I'll leave the math to you, peeps.Bless the multi-pov option! I really didn’t mind at all those Dorian or Chaol chapters.And, yes, feel free to read this as: I really didn’t mind Dorian nor Chaol.Which brings us to the romance side.Guess what? There was a love triangle! *fakes shock* I know.So. Original. And. Unexpected.Even if Huey, Dewey, and Louie engaged in some sort of inevitable, twisted and confused love triangle, which I’ll never be a fan of, I still couldn’t care enough to let it bother me. Just give me some substance, I don’t care who sucks whose face.Now, at the question, do you ship Celeana with Dorian or Chaol, I'll reply: WHAT EVEN IS SHIPPING ANYMORE.Since, y'know, I think it'd too much to hope Dorian and Chaol will both dump Sardothien, grab a dozen puppies each, and ride their way into the sunset, together.The other characters didn’t really convince me that much (although no one got nearly on my nerves as Miss Main Character did), I felt like there could have been more work behind, just like the whole story didn’t exactly engage me from start to end for the very same reason.You can tell someone didn't really do their best at researching. The setting and the way all characters behave could have been a little more authentic, and, holy crow, theooc-ismwas too much, even for a mediocre book.Still, I think after a good 60%, both the writing and the plot really improve right before my eyes.I’m convinced, maybe, I would have loved this book better if I read it when it first came out.I have too high standards now. really, it's like a curse.I’ve never really followed SJM but I feel like I should give her another chance (brain screaming: I WANT MORE DORIAN AND CHAOL). I’ll try not to let it influence negatively my coming judgment and consider this book an isolated case, and also this series’ chance to prove how sometimes books can upgrade in reverse, and put some more hopes intoCrown of Midnight.Until then, two and a half stars are more than enough.ACTUAL RATINGS 2.5/5{update July 2021: while my opinion on this book hasn't changed at all (Throne of Glass was and still is a let down with insufferable characters and cringey writing) I wanted to make this little update to tell whoever will read this review that I ended up caving and I continued the series, and I'm glad I did, because it really does get better. The plot in particular. SJM stepped up her writing game and I also ended up liking celaena's character development. This to say, don't be surprised if you step upon another of my THG reviews and find it more positive than this one. Love what I learned from this: sometimes giving a book series another chance wil end up surprising you.}",2
859,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","It’s been 6 years since I first picked up this book and discovered this series. I’ve read it 6 times since.All the feelings continue to exist and intensify each time.I’m gonna love this series till I’m old and grey.————————————Reread x5! And that’s the review.————————————Reread x 4!I can’t believe this series is coming to an end. 😢It’s brought me so much comfort and happiness.Obsession isn’t enough of a word to describe what I feel towards Sarah J Maas and these books. Fandoms have never been my thing. Well, since Harry Potter. Then I came across her books because of the hype and I am grateful to have found people as loony over it as I am.——————————————————This series seems to be getting better with every reread! And this book in particular as it was my least favourite. But it helped reading The Assassin's Blade before Throne of Glass as it delved deeper into Celaena's character and through that book one was able to form a connection with her.Her skills as an assassin aren't really explored in Throne of Glass, it's all talk and no action. But reading the prequel novellas, you are able to see how hardcore she actually is, thus accepting the all talk and no action that happens in Throne of Glass.I love the characters, the world and Maas's writing. I always feel so wrapped in it!So many hints were dropped in this book that are explored in the other books. I loved being able to pick up on them this time round and appreciate that Maas cleverly plants those points in her books and later builds up upon them so thoroughly.",5
860,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","""I swear on my crown that the pup shall live.""The five Throne of Glass novellas did a great job convincing me to push toward the main series. I mean what's not to like: A mysterious new world, a set of interesting characters (in novellas) and a lot of potential plot-lines to explore. But, after reading this first book, the only reason I'm rounding up what felt like a 2.5-star read to 3-star (instead of 2) is, me not belonging in the intended audience. But even for a young audience, I believe some of the stuff here are too shallow and rudimentary, especially in the first half of the book.Though it wasn't much original, I still found the plot to be interesting. The unfairly convicted protagonist trying to make a change by fighting on multiple fronts, and some politics to keep things heated among characters, while adding a bit of dark magic to have a little mysteriousness. Story starts with Celaena being conditionally released from prison, to participate in a competition which expects to select a champion for the king. I was under the impression that this competition would be the main plotline, but it was mostly on sidelines. Politics played a major part, and I think that's what I enjoyed the most here. As for magic, there wasn't a whole lot of revelations in this one, however I'm hoping everything would become clear in time. But after a few chapters, it quickly becomes apparent that the main theme here is romance. Everything revolves around Dorian - Celaena - Chaol trio, and leading up to a too obvious love triangle. But at least, it's not one of those terrible ones, where one of the three being a complete villain. The pace of the story was also okay, and even though the book wasn't much impactful, it was kind of a fun read overall. But the prose has a lot of room to improve, especially by moving beyond the pure melodramatic conversation.However, I have to admit, it did get better towards the end. Even though the villain turned out to be the obvious one, I loved the detailed final battle, until the very end.From the very first page, I didn't expect much from Celaena. It was clear from the novellas, aside from being fun, she had a number of conflicting traits, and was not very congruous with being an infamous assassin. Trying to squeeze in this many qualities to a single character is hardly a good idea, even if the character is of an age suit to be full of wisdom, and experience. But when you try that with an eighteen year old girl, who is the definition of impulsiveness, it is not surprising that the character turning out to be an annoyance. Even if the author had intended to create a strong role model for readers of the intended audience, I think the character came out looking too shallow, and inconsistent. I'm not giving examples to avoid spoilers, but one does not have to look deep to find her shortcomings. Celaena might be a very popular character but she is anything but a role-model in my opinion.If it wasn't for the novellas, I probably would not have finished this book. And even with the novellas, I still might've discontinued, if it wasn't for the shared opinion among many that first couple of books being the weakest in the series. I hope, at least in time, these qualities would fade away. At this point, I cannot say that I liked the prose that much either, but I'm hoping that'd improve as well.""So, I highly suggest, Miss Sardothien, that you get your arrogance in check.""",3
861,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","I'm afraidthis just wasn't for me. I heard it being sold as GRR Martin'sGame of Throneswritten for the female audience --- well, as a female audience, I am offended. As an avid reader of the fantasy genre, I am saddened that this is marketed as a fantasy-for-females. Thisbeing a YA does not excuse it from being riddled with clichés, painfully obvious foreshadowing, and a ghost of a fantasy worldruthlessly overshadowed by romantic overtones.Fans of fantasy -actualfantasy - I don't suppose would much enjoyThrone of Glass, either. And even though the synopsis makes it soundHunger Games-esque, I'm afraid on that front, you'd be disappointed, too.I would say, if you enjoyedThe SelectionbyKiera Cass, but long for a lessself-abasingcharacter than America, then I think you might enjoyThrone of Glass.I must warn you:this review will be long, and most of it dedicated to a bit of a character study if anything; and whySarah J Maas failed at her character of an assassin. But let's start at the beginning.Celaena Sardothien has spent years in the death camps of Endovier, where she will ultimately spend the rest of her life. Until, that is, crown prince Dorian appoints her to enter in a competition for the title of King's Champion, who will be tasked to do the King's secret bidding. But when one by one, the competitors turn up dead, Celaena knows that something evil lurks the castle.Instead of the action-packed novel I was lead to believe I'd be reading, all I got were ... balls and dances, and then some fight scenes are thrown in there just to make sure we don'tforgetthat this is supposed to be a story of an assassin. No,Sarah J Maas, I hopeyoudon't forget what we came here for.When I say thatThrone of Glasslowers the standards of Fantasy, I mean that it doesn't seem to know much about its own setting.Royal Households everywhere, at every turn of the century, have a set of rules dictating things such as etiquette; what is proper and what isimproper. And these rules don't exist for the sake of it - there arereasonsbehind etiquette: to prevent affronting your peers, for instance. To prevent harmful court gossip. To prevent a crown prince from running around and fathering a thousand bastards before he is even dubbed King, creating more than enough future claimants to the throne.I assume the same applies inThrone of Glass; for instance thereareetiquettes mentioned that deem a prince dancing with only one partner something considerably rude.Soit threw me way out of time and placewhen I found out that Chaol, Captain of the Guards, would enter Celaena's chambers at any time of day he wishes - even when she's still dressed in her scanty nightgown.Even the Prince does this; visiting her whensoever he pleases. You may call me a prude, you may call me many anti-feminist names, but this is not acceptable. Not because I give two cents on what the court would say about Celaena; not that I give two cents whether or not the prince was copulating with her; butbecause this is simply not done. Especiallynotwithout repercussion, if even in the form of social stigma.Celaena had a maid waiting on her - but it seems that all she was good for was putting her clothes on. It wasChaolwho barged in her room, underdressed as she was, just to wake her up. He is aCaptain of the Guards. This should not even be his task!These small, ridiculousignorance of Royal Household etiquetteanddivision of labourmade it seem as if the whole thing was poorly researched. You may argue that this wasnotfeudal England; that this world was built entirely ofMaas' imagination, but things such aslogicshould still apply. And when has iteverbeen logical for aCaptain of Guardsto be responsible for waking up guests? When has it ever beenacceptablefor a Prince to come and go, without repercussion, into a common girl's chambers?But that is exactly the problem withThrone of Glass.The entire premisewasn'tlogical.By this I am of course talking about the King's competition.""(...) He's hosting a competition. He invited twenty-three members of his council to each sponsor a would-be Champion to train in the glass castle and ultimately compete in a duel.""... and this Champion of his is tasked ...To work for the King of Adarlan as his loyal servant. She raised her chin. To kill for him (...)But where is the logic fail?you ask me. Allow me to reiterate. He wants aloyalsubject to kill for him, without question, with the utmost secrecy. Yet he chooses thisloyal subjectthrough acompetition. Not only that, he makes hiscouncilmenchoose the competitors for him.I may not be a direct member of a royal family myself, but I know there are things such as courtintrigueandhidden agendasand hell, there are hundreds upon thousands of discrete allegiances and plots being made left, right and centre.Do youreallywant yourfuture, ""loyal"" Championto be handpicked out of a number ofcriminalsand entrusted to yourcouncilmen?The whole competition thing wasn't at all very thought through. In the end, it felt as if it was just there to get the story going, to get Celaena into the castle.The competition itself was a let downnstead of some fight-to-the-death (or similar) trope, we get ... a race. An archery competition. Wall-climbing. And a lot of others that happened off screen.Amidst all these competitions and training programs, the plot scattered into flirting banter, gatecrashing parties, and some girl-on-girl hating; as ifthe author wasn't quite sure whether she wanted her novel to be the story of a ruthless assassin, or the romances of a ruthless assassin princess-wannabe.And now I get to Celaena, the princess-wannabe. Allow me to present a number of quotes I've highlighted:She loved clothes--loved the feeling of silk, of velvet, of satin, of suede and chiffon--and was fascinated by the grace of seams, the intricate perfection of an embossed surface. And when she won this ridiculous competition, when she was free ... she could buy all the clothes she wanted.*Everything was wet and half-frozen, and while she could bear sodden hair, she couldn't withstand the agony of wet shoes.*There were more Champions seated at the tables--even the pimply-faced Pelor sat near Chaol! A half-rate boy assassin! She bared her teeth. How dare she be denied an invitation to the feast?You read all that and tell me, do you imagine these thoughts coming from a renown, world-classassassin?An assasin complaining about her wet shoes?About not being invitedto a banquet?No. Two things strike me here: First,she had just spent years at adeath camp, but her behaviour upon leaving it did not portray any humility or gratefulness of being far away from all those whippings and forced labour. You'd think she'd just be glad to be away from the mines and pickaxe to becomplaining about wet shoesSMH.Second;this sounds more like something a ditzy princess-wannabe would say. Oh, after I win this competition,I'm gonna buy myself some clothes. For someone who has spent years suffering, who spent her childhood being trained as a ruthless killer, she comes across sounding soprivileged.Now, I'm not an assassin. I've never beentrainedas one, but for years Ididgo through a whole series of martial arts before finding one that suited my small stature. And ofallmartial arts -- from karate to jiu-jitsu to wushu to the one I finally settled with -- there wasone thingwe were taught was the foundation of any great martial artist.Discipline.And I'm sorry, Celaena. Butyou don't have it.This is her reaction tofailing at a game of pool:A shriek of rage ripped from her throat, and Celaena ran over to the pocket. She first screamed at the ball, then took the cue in her hands and bit down upon the shaft, still screaming through her clamped teeth. Finally the assassin stopped and slapped the three ball into the pocket.This is her discipline at training:""It's cold,"" she moaned, holding her knees to her body. She didn't care that she had only a few months to beat the other Champions--she needed sleep.""I'm afraid it doesn't work that way; you don't get to tell me that this girl is an accomplished, feared assassin at the age of.... sixteen?.... buther entire mentality, her entirepersonalitydoes not ring true of an assassin.Do you think the realm's greatest killer would be afraid ofwalking in a glass house?""Only an idiot would walk in a house made of glass.""(...)The thought of standing on floors of glass made her queasy.....afraid ofheights?She had a terrible headache around her left temple. Everything was sickly and frail. They were so high up, so dangerously high ...Do you think they moan and whinge and complain at the drop of a hat?Once they'd finished their run, they trained in a private room far from her competitor's eyes. Until, that is, she collapsed to the ground and cried that she was about to die of hunger and fatigue.*Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer. ""I look ridiculous! These pants are absurd, and this shirt is awful.""For heaven's sake, you're an assassin, not a supermodel. No. Discipline doesn't just mean getting up every morning and training every day. It also means adiscipline of the mind. It means self-restraint. It means keeping your head low. What kind of assassinwantsto be the centre of attention?? To have her skills known?? If you want glory, then you're in the wrong career path. Be a damned knight.But Celaena isvainandself-absorbed. Shewants to be in the spotlight.""I hate all these guards and nonsense; I hate you telling me to hold back when Brullo sings Cain's praises and I'm just there, boring and unnoticed in the middle.""*""Do you know how insulting it is to pretend to be some nobody thief from a small city in Fenharrow?""Not only that, but she's also very contradictory and hypocritical:What was a ""Champion"" but a dressed-up name for murderer? Could she actually stomach working for him?And I suppose ""assassin"" is just a synonym for mercy-killer? But enough of her faults.Let's take a look at her more positive attributes.She's beautiful. In factsobeautiful that she drains the blood out of peoplewho sees her:Celaena smiled smugly to herself as she nodded to a passing noble-man, who raised his eyebrows at the sight of her. He was immensely pale, she noticed as he opened his mouth to say something, but Celaena continued down the hall.In factsobeautiful that other ladies envy her and she has to shove that in their facesbecause you can't have a YA novel without other girls being envious of our heroine!:She smiled at the young chevaliers as they passed--and smirked at the court women who eyed her pink-and-white gown. She couldn't blame them; the dress was spectacular. And she was spectacular in it. Even Redd, one of the handsomer guards posted outside her rooms, had said so.Also shallow, as it seems, because if Reddhadn'tbeen handsome, his opinion wouldn't have mattered, right?Still not convinced that she's shallow?Why did Chaol never joke with her as Dorian did? Perhaps he truly didn't find her attractive. The possibility of it stung more than she would have liked.You see,because people can only like you if you'reattractive. Oh, sorry, I got sidetracked. We were talking over herpositiveattributes. Well, she's a great dancer:She didn't falter a single step, nor did she seem to care about the many angry female faces that watched as dance after dance passed and they didn't switch partners.She also plays ameanpianobecause music is like, the way we show just how deep and artistic our heroine is:Celaena eyed the pianoforte. She used to play--oh, she'd loved to play, loved music(...)Shelovesdogsbecause that's how we know she's a kind-hearted person. No evil person is an animal lover!:""Of course I want her,"" Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be. ""But I want her trained. I don't want her urinating on everything and chewing on furniture and shows and books. And I want her to sit when I tell her to and lay down and roll over (...)Oh, but she doesn't want to beinconveniencedso she doesn't want totrain it herselfof course! She speaks foreign languages,and!just so we canallrelate to her-- she also loves books!I could go on andpoint out her inconsistencies, but this is getting much too long for my liking. In short,Celaena Sardothien is a Mary Sue. But even worse --she is anunlikeable, vain, shallow, self-centred Mary Sue. And if you expect me to believe she's a deadly killer, then you better think again.But that is the final problem I had with this book -- the narratorconstantlytells us what to believe.There was something great and deadly concealed within her, and he didn't like it.while moments later, she's rolling on the ground, crying and whinging that she's gonna die of starvation. Yeah, no.Also,""Because it looks like he's in love with her,"" he said, and walked away.(...) His shoulders were straight, his back erect. He looked like a man. Like a king.Yeah, if you say so.But,you say to me,there must besomethingyou liked?Well, Ididlike Celaena's relationship with the err, Indian princess. I forgot her name. Because I didn't like the actual princess herself -- she doesn't know tact. She doesn't know diplomacy. She comes to a foreign realm and all she does is whinge and insult their language and clothes and court.So, no. I didn't like the plot, I didn't like the characters. The only stars go to Chaol for being a beacon of sanity amidst all the awfulness. It's a pity he, too, fell for our Mary Sue.",2

You should see my Harry Potter stuff =) ↓I listened to the audio this time. It took a minute to get used to the narrator but I finally got settled in with her.I love Celaena Sardothien. She was taken from Endovier (the death camp) and brought to the castle to fight with other Champions. If she wins then she has to kill for the King for 4 years and then she is free. I have a feeling that's not to be. Prince Dorian is the one that chose her as his champion to fight against the others. Celaena is being called Lady Lillian because they don't want anyone to know who she is, since she is a bad @ssed assassin.I loved and still to this day love Chaol. But, I never liked the fact that Dorian and Celaena shared a few kisses. Ewww, I just don't like Dorian that way. He's like a best boy friend. I do love that he gave Celaena a dog she named, Fleetfoot =)I mean Calaena loves books and dogs and she's an assassin. How awesome is that. Oh, and the part where Prince Dorian picked up one of the steamy books she had been reading. Lol""Sunset's Passions,"" he read, and opened the book to a random page to read aloud. "" 'His hands gently caressed her ivory, silky br---' "" His eyes widened. ""By the Wyrd! Do you actually read this rubbish?

I'm glad they were friends.But . . something is killing off the champions in very narly ways. We do finally find out what it is and it just figures. That's all I'm going to say.I loathed Cain, one of the champions, and Kaltain, an evil woman that was up to no good as well.I loved Nehemia, she's from another kingdom and there for her own reasons.

Not to mention completely badass, and could kill anyone with a hairpin if she wanted to. Great high fantasy, i cannot wait for the next in the series! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5
864,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","A female version of Gaston from Beauty and the BeastThrone of Glass is my first Sarah J. Maas novel, and I don’t understand the hype. Warning: extremely sarcastic book review coming up!Celaena Sardothien is the world’s most famous assassin. However, she has been captured and is doing hard labor in a mine. Today is her lucky day though. The kind and absolutely dashing Prince Dorian arrives to save the day! Celaena can enter a competition to be the King’s Champion. If she wins the competition, she then has to serve four years of service under the king, and then she is free! Yippie!The concepts in this book sound right up my alley. Female characters? Yes. However, my gosh, this is probably the most unlikeable character that I have ever endured. I was hoping that someone would finish her off.Celaena is one of the least humble characters ever written. She is the female version of Gaston from Beauty and The Beast but worse. So much of the book is about, “Oh, I could take this guy down with one bat of an eye.” Give me a break. When she finally arrives for the competition, she does not seem to do any training other than what is forced on her by Prince Dorian or Chaol. If you want to be the best at something, you usually have a routine. Each day, you know exactly what to do to train and prepare.Celaena likes to sleep in and dream of kissing. I really wish that I was still producing Booktube videos because this book would make a great spoof video. I will just have to do my best to state the overexaggerated nature of Celaena.If Celaena was a book influencer, she started reading when she was three-months old. She has read a book in every state and country. She has read every book on every checklist, and she has a photographic memory. When she gets ready for a book quiz, she doesn’t even open the book to refresh her memory. And she giggles and dreams of boys kissing her. Tee-hee!The “romance” in this book is absolute cringe. One of her suitors is so struck by her beauty. Apparently, Celanea should have a GoodReads account, because nearly every day she could have the opportunity to receive creepy “hey beautiful” messages from fake accounts. This would make her swoon. Although someone can compliment a person on his or her beauty, so what? Beautiful is primarily about winning the genetic lottery. If you want to really compliment a person, say something about their work ethic, their kind and gentle nature, their thirst for knowledge, their passion to change the world.Throne of Glass is so boring. The King’s Champion has various stages to the competition. Because of the writing style, the suspense did not build. There is a stage of the competition, and it is described in a paragraph or one page. And people die in this book. However, our “world-famous” assassin Celaena does very little about it. Sucks to be them I guess. She is too busy thinking about kisses. The characters aren’t developed enough so when they die off, no one cares.This book completely lacks the strong female characters that I love. This is a love-sick assassin who doesn’t really show her full capabilities. It is really hard to take her seriously when she spends more time pouting about festivals and dreaming of kisses than preparing to win the championship.Also, anyone who has less than perfect skin is “bad” in this book. I have a real problem with this. Beauty is only skin deep, and I would rather have a partnership with someone with bad skin and has a bit of sense than someone who is “gorgeous” and can’t hold up their end of a conversation. But personal preference.Overall, the concept of a strong female assassin in a slightly fantasy setting sounds appealing; however, Sarah J. Maas did not execute it properly in Throne of Glass. If you really want a strong female character in a fantasy setting, I highly suggest The Golden Compass or Northern Lights by Philip Pullman. Lyra beats Celaena every single day of the week.2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones’s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",1
865,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)","4/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Libraries were full of ideas—perhaps the most dangerous and powerful of all weapons.”Here I am again, back in a different world ofSarah J. Maas! This is a very popular series. An extremely popular series, an exceptionally hyped up series, a tremendouslyOLD AF SERIES. Listen to me here, if I were a fantasy fan when I was a teenager, I would have definitely read this book. But you know, my relationship with fantasy hasn't been lit for the last2583 years, so I hadn't picked it up. I started loving fantasy again this year because ofA Court of Thorns and Roses, a book I bought because I needed it for my uni thesis, not because I was interested in reading fantasy again.SO YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH WORK I GOT WITH FANTASY BOOKS. I haven't read fantasy since 2010. I have a million fantasy series to catch up to. I'm nervous.I WANT TO READ ALL THE FANTASY NOW AND NOTHING BUT FANTASY.ANYWAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS BOOK.After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin.Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom. Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilarating. But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her ... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best.Then one of the other contestants turns up dead ... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.I had very high expectations for this book which were partially met. As I said before, my firstSarah J. Maasbook isA Court of Thorns and Roses, which is the her latest series. Most of you have readThrone of Glassfirst and thenA Court of Thorns and Roses, and you have experienced her writing flourish. I haven't. I read her better book first. I can see now that she has improved so much, her writing is so much better now. Some things in the writing of this book weren't my thing, like repetitions of some phrases, ""assassin"" being referred to Celaena the whole entire time (which bugged me a bit), poor choice of words at some parts. But I recognized Sarah in this book. I can recognize her writing style now, and I truly love it.This book gave me suchGame of ThronesandHarry Potter and the Goblet of Firevibes! From the badass main character with the hard to pronounce name which reminded me ofDaenerys Targaryento the championship which was like theTriwizard TournamentinGoblet of Fire, the vibes were fucking lit yo! The worldSarah J. Maashas created in this book was so immersive, I was so into it when I was reading the book. I wasn't even confused with all the names and places and words, it all came natural to me. I can see how after this book, the world will expand to an enormous extend with magic and Fae and so many new characters appearing, and I'm here for it!The multiple character perspectives was a surprise to me. Celaena owns the most chapters, but we can see things told from mostly all the characters, (even the fucking King) which is something I was surprised about as it does not happen in her other series. I loved it. This is what I missed from theA Court of Thorns and Rosesseries. The multiple character POVs. And I relish in the fact that we can explore things from numerous viewpoints.CELAENA GUYS. CELAENA SARDOTHIEN. I LOVE YOU TO THE MOON AND BACK. I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY AND FIND THE BEST MATCH FOR YOU AND UNDERSTAND YOUR PAST AND YOUR LINEAGE AND BASICALLY CONTINUE TO BE A BADASS QUEEN. I didn't expect her character to be like this, to be honest. The book description suggested a ruthless, cold-hearted killer, and I expected as much. But her compassion and her kindness and her passion for multiple things showed from the very first pages. She is a merciless assassin who can end you with a snap of her finger but she has also kept her personality. Her humor, her quirkiness. She loves beautiful dresses, she loves to eat good food, puppies 🐶, and she loves books.SHE IS A READER GUYS. I absolutelyADOREwhen book characters are readers. Especially in fantasy. I can relate to them so much easier.I immensely appreciated her friendship with Nehemia and that it wasn't ruined at the end. I was so scared about this. I loathe when they make female characters hate each other in books, especially about a love interest! Just don't, please.Girls need to stick together!I want to see more of her in the future books. I'm sure we will, but it was left kind of wonky in this book. I suspected her too, in the middle of the book, and I was certain it was her, orchestrating everything. But it was Cain. The obvious choice. It was anticlimactic, to be totally honest. I wanted it to be someone else. We all expected Cain, and it was Cain. I didn't believe it would be him, I was certain there would be a plot twist, at the end, or something. But no.AND NOWWWWWWthe romance. I love both Dorian and Chaol, both for different reasons. I'm so fond of the relationships Celaena holds with both of them. They're so different, and yet they both mean so much to her.I SHIPPED BOTH THOSE SHIPS THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK.But I lean like 51% on Dorian. Their scenes were cuter, and I think they have more things in common. Their passion for books, the billiard scenes, the music scene,THE FUCKING PUPPY, the dance, the kisses, the candy. They made me feels so many things! And then we have scenes with Chaol and I was back in that train again.COME ON CELAENA, DARLING, JUST CHOOSE. I will choose for you, but for myself. I have no problem with that, sweetie 😉 I was conflicted about her train of thought, to be frank. The one moment she found Dorian extremely attractive and she wanted to kiss him, and the next she found Chaol handsome and she wanted to spend more and more time with him. I was as much confused as she is. But I'm delighted that the author didn't make the romance the main part of the book. She didn't portray Celaena as a character who depends on a man to save her, or to make her feels special or anything alike. She would have been fine without them as love interests in her life. Furthermore, I have to talk about Nox. What a sweetheart. What a wasted opportunity on a character. We basically saw nothing of him. I thought he was gonna be a third love interest in the beginning and I was like""WOAH WOAH THERE SARAH HON SLOW DOWN""but luckily he wasn't. But I kept thinking about his character.YOU'RE THE TRUE AND UNDOUBTFUL EPITOME OF THE WORD ""FRIENDZONE"". I hope we see him again.The final battle... oh man. It dragged more than it should, to be honest, but it was breathtaking. Sarah knows how to write a good jaw-dropping ending. There was so much information throughout this whole battle, that I had to reread some parts to totally grasp what was going on. It was so intense and magical and out of this world. I was so proud of myGIRLfor still being strong and trying to fight even though she was drugged. She made me believe, at some parts, that she would win. Kaltain. UGH. May we never see this bitch again. I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN WE FOUND OUT THE DUKE WAS SCHEMING BEHIND HER BACK ALL ALONG. I know we will see her again, but fuck her. I don't want to see her lying ass point of view again.To sum it all up, this was a pretty strong beginning to a series. I only gave it4 starsbecause it didn't overwhelm me. I keep comparing it to A Court of Thorns and Roses, which is like my favorite series, at the moment. I can't stop comparing these two series, damn it. But I loved it nonetheless and I'm waiting for the next book,Crown of Midnight, to arrive. I'm actually pretty excited, cause I have heard these books get so much better. and I can already see that. So till the next one... K BYE!!",4

And not what I expected at all, but hear me out! Put down the pitchforks and fire! I'm still on board; Queen SJM hasn't lost me yet!After reading the back blurb, I was imagining this competition something more of a Battle Royale or Hunger Games-esque battle to the death. Color me surprised when I'm 200 pages in and basically NO face time is given to this competition. The first 70% of this book books is mainly:1) ""Wow! Look at this beautiful dress! It's more beautifuller than all the other dresses! And I'm wearing it! Because I'm an assassin but I also have lots of feelings and like to be girly!""2) ""Ugh. I'm such a pretty girl and I kind of know it, but I'm going to keep acting like I don't and will play these boys back and forth like Charlie Daniels andThe Devil Went Down To Georgiabc there haven't been enough love triangles in the world yet DANGIT!""3) BLA BLA BLA *tiny vague mention of competition without any scenes taking place in competition* BLA BLA BLA.BUT THEN!!!!It actually got good. Really good. I was completely sucked in, and it reminded me of how bored I was in ACOTAR until we got under the mountain. So I think a 3.25 star rating is fair and evident that I'll continue on with the series bc now I'm hooked THANKS A LOT SJM!PS- I know this was written when she was a heck of a lot younger, but did anyone else feel like this series (at least starts off) more juvenile and immature than ACOTAR?",3

It did not disappoint and if I am being totally honest, I loved it even more then the first book! This book is nonstop entertainment. I was either swooning, laughing, or fanning my face the entire book.!Lina is just an FMC after my own heart. I can't even articulate properly how much I love her. She is so badass, independent and so damn funny! Her freak outs over her relationship with Nash had me keeled over with laughter and all her sass and witty come backs and her friendships with the other characters was perfection.Nash. This MAN! This vulnerable, sweet, simping, infuriating, stubborn, pain in the ass man! I love him. He is so perfect for Lina. I loved how the story showed him dealing with PTSD and how he comes to terms with his past. And the dog!!!! The romance is so, so good. That epilogue was EVERYTHING! Yes, I totally cried!The reason these books are so good besides the crazy good romance, are the external relationships! -The girls! Naomi, Sloane and Lina steal the show with their friendship, I laughed so hard with them and all of their many antics throughout the book. (boozy girls time, Halloween)- Stef and Lina working out together with the senior citizens.-The soccer game!-The town in everyone's businessNow I have to just countdown the days until we get Lucien and Sloanes book!

879,"Things We Hide from the Light (Knockemout, #2)","– 2.75 starsi have a very strong instinct when it comes to certain characters and books in a series and how i feel about them. from the first interaction between Lucian and Sloane inThings We Never Got Overi knew they would bethecouple for me in this series. so when Lucy announced that Things We Hide From the Light is actually aboutNash(H) andAngelina(h), my excitement for them was lukewarm and that’s exactly how this book turned out to be.Nash was fine as a character, Lina was fine as a character, the romance was fine. it was very very very slowburn tho and nothing happens between them until 60%. the dog Nash found and adopted was cute tho. the length of the book is way too long. no contemporary romance should be 600 pages, but since i like Lucy’s writing and her books are pretty easy to get through i’ll let the page length slide for now, since it wasn’t too boring to read.Things We Hide From the Lighthad so many subplots that the romance felt a bit secondary at times. the epilogue and especially the bonus epilogue was amazing.the secondary characters stole the spotlight for me. i really enjoyed seeing the Knox & Noami cameos and of course my babies Lucian and Sloane. all my highlights for this book are actually their scenes and september 5 can’t come sooner enough.“You have a date?” Naomi shouted the question loud enough that all the men turned and stared at us. Lucian looked like he was about to set the world on fire with his dark smolder.“Thanks, mega mouth,” Sloane muttered. “Yes. I have a date.”“A date or a hookup?” I asked at normal volume.Lucian’s hand closed into a fist, crushing his to-go cup and exploding coffee everywhere.jealous Lucian i need more of it 🙇🏻‍♀️Lucian deposited Sloane next to Naomi. “Move from this spot and we’ll have problems,” he warned, looming over her with a finger in her face. “Bite me, Lucifer.”I went back to the wall. “You know what I remember from back in the day?” “What?” “I remember you and Lucy sharing these long, meaningful looks in the hall between classes. I remember him ripping the helmet off Jonah Bluth and putting him on his ass during football practice because Jonah said something about your body that I as an adult man with great respect for women won’t repeat.” “It was about my boobs, wasn’t it?” Sloane quipped. “The price you pay for developing early.”at this point i’m salvating over their shared history. will this be second chance?! i need more of their times in high school together.. everything i know about them so far is delicious broody bad boy x nerdy girl that barely acknowledge each other in school, but sneaking in each others bed rooms in private helloooo? i’m seated.“Okay, seriously? You hate her guts but you don’t want her dating anyone else? Even you have to realize how unhealthy that is,” I said.“I never claimed to be healthy,” Lucian said in his scary voice.my obsession with them is not healthy either, but who needs healthy anyway…┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑KNOCKEMOUT#1 Things We Never Got Over – 3.5 stars (Knox x Naomi)#2Things We Hide From The Light– 2.75 stars (Nash x Lina)#3 Things We Left Behind – tbr (Lucian x Sloane)┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙",3
880,"Things We Hide from the Light (Knockemout, #2)","*Why can't I find a 5 star Lucy Score book?! Skip to the end for my theories. Otherwise this book was a great read and my review is below.*""You make me feel things. And after going long enough without feeling anything, feeling something--even if its anger or adrenaline--is better than the nothing.""Nash says this, but it honestly could apply to both Nash and Lina.So this is much better than the first one, which is surprising to me since I didn’t particularly care about Lina in book one and Nash came across as boring in that book. However, this book took both characters and spun them into deeply beautiful, complicated, scared, and passionate human beings who are just looking for that one person to bring them out of the darkness and into the light (get it?! title significance?! but its true). Lina and Nash deserve the same hype that Naomi and Knox get in this series. I love them more than Naomi and Knox. They felt more real to me, like these people could exist in real life with these exact problems.And there was only avery tinythird act break up--as in it lasted like two minutes for them before they make up!! Hallelujah rejoice. So neither one did anything extremely stupid to cause some massive issue. Its so nice to read books where there aren’t ten chapters devoted to a breakup you know is going to get resolved and is just difficult to read. This book doesn't have that, and its amazing.Parts of this made me ugly cry. I loved seeing them both go from mindsets where they didn't believe good things in life would ever happen to them to not only believing it, but wanting all those good things together (the epilogues were 10/10 perfect and made me sob). Lina and Nash are the definition of opposites attract. They start out as sort of enemies (in a very loose sense) but it quickly turns into an insta-love that is somehow NOT AT ALL cringe or unbelievable. It's more that Nash finally feelssomethingwhen he is with Lina, whereas ever since his *accident* (keeping spoiler free for anyone who didn't read book one) he's been facing depression and anxiety and panic attacks and overall feelings of emptiness. Enter Lina and his body finally starts to feel something again. Its heartwarming to see his journey from this constant state of darkness into wanting to live again, all thanks to his feelings for Lina. And Lina is a badass bad girl who falls for the hometown hero cop. PLUS he calls her Angel which just makes my heart melt and is my favorite nickname ever now.Think:opposites attract. bad girl good guy. chief of police. spicespicespice. small town. small town crime mystery. forced proximity. fall and halloween vibes. tons of bantering. tons of cameos from book one. the best character growth and development. the cutest rescue dog! happily ever after. beautiful quotes about life. A solid 4 stars, no more no less.So as mentioned above, I will carry on with my everlasting hunt for a 5 star Lucy Score book. I have read 7 of her books at this point and have finished each (except for one) with the same ""great but not excellent"" feeling. So when I finished this, I really tried to think about why none of her books have been ""perfect"" yet all (except for one) have been ""very good.""I came up with the following reasons why none of her books have been 5 stars:- Every character has the same personality across all of her books. You can basically replace any of her small towns with another of her small towns and the story would still work because everyone talks the same way, acts the same way, has the same quirks, uses the same style of bantering, etc. I know its just how she writes, but can we change it up? I should not be able to read one series and then find the same or identical conversations in another.- The above also applies to the main characters in each book. If you gave me a sentence or activity that someone did in this book, I would honestly not be able to tell you if it was Knox or Nash or Stef or even Naomi's dad. Quirky comeback from one of the girls? Could be Lina, Naomi, Sloan, Fi, Amanda, Liza J, god it could even be Waylay. Couldn't tell the difference. Everyone says the same stuff, with the sole exception of Lucian.- Her spice is good and there's a lot of it, but its not emotional? Is it just me? Its explicit and everything it should be but its never elicited much emotion from me. No idea why.- These books have no reason being as long as they are. This is because we get useless information about useless secondary characters that have no impact on the plot. When Nash was getting his ass tattooed, we learned about the backstory of the tattoo artist. Why? This tattoo artist had no importance in this book. I skip through so much fluff that doesn't mean anything.- MORE TO COME (maybe)PS Lucian and Sloane's book has so much potential to be 5 stars. Seriously so hyped and have so much expectations for that and cannot wait to read it!!!",4
881,"Things We Hide from the Light (Knockemout, #2)","2.75 starsWhat’s the point of having a chief of police as the main character if you’re not at least gonna make him use his cuffs.

Though TWNGO is still my top favorite Lucy Score book, I enjoyed TWHFTL so much!Nash and Lina were so fun together. Their book was full of banter, excitement, and suspense. It also had some emotion and I loved seeing Nash open up to Lina. It took me a bit to connect to them as a couple, but once I did I was a goner for them!

883,"Things We Hide from the Light (Knockemout, #2)","We're back at Knockemout for the story of a man who dreams to settle down and a woman who absolutely knows what's best for her and what she wants in life - aka, Knox and Naomi’s reverse story.The rating is this slow for a good reason, but this one was better than the previous one: Nash is slightly better than his brother and Lina’s narration was more bearable than Naomi’s, because at least she didn't need a coffee every ten minutes.BUT it's difficult to deny thatThings We Hide from the Darkis a copycat ofThings We Never Got Over. Just listen: we meet Lisa in weird circumstances in the first book of the series, like her from the beginning and we obviously need more of her. So it comes out she has a cool job and she's a good motive to be in a town where there’s absolutely nothing. Then she develops a crush on his next-door neighbour and praises his ass (a lot), has sex with him (a lot), thinks it could actually work out, and then she gets kidnapped; he saves her, and they realise how much in love they are, and years after they end up with their happily ever after, married with kids, surrounded by their friends.Good thing this was supposed to be a slow burn.It's fine, I know what was coming the moment I opened the book.Did I expect Nash “the good guy” Morgan to act like his brother, constantly saying how unfair it is of him to say how much he needs her and asking her things she can't say no to? Well, no, because he's supposed to be the good guy.However, the most obnoxious thing in this book is Knox’s redemption arc. He had his book, he had his moment, and he ended up with a wife and a kid. But he’s still a pain in my ass by showing up every fifty pages to care about someone he had never mentioned before she had shown up - he and Lina hooked up in college but now he cares his brother doesn't break her heart?!Lucy Score’s narration skills haven't improved since the last book, unfortunately. Her metaphors are still bad and her books are still too long and repetitive.Also, I had already noticed this but now I feel it's not only me: the scenes where they’re all together feel so fake, like in a comedy series. I don't really know how to explain it, but it's like inSex and the Citywhen the girls get lunch and everything is perfect and no one has ever had a bad day which gets annoyed by Carrie’s last rant. It's a complicated metaphor, but the girls that get it, they know.Now more than ever I'm curious about Sloane and Lucian’s story because they used to hate each other and then, five years later, they're kinda together. Probably married? We’ll see.Anyway, I did it for you, guys.↠2 stars",2

It reminded me that I need to workout 🙃🤣)Can my resolve be as strong as Lina’s thighs were and Nash’s resistance to pushing all the way in (😉) during that fight in Chapter 36?🙏🏻Lina’s (37) in town not only because Knox (book 1 H) asked her to be in his wedding since she’s one of closest friends, but because she’s also going after the man who shot Nash (41) in book 1, Duncan Hugo (she’s recovering an asset).Nash’s memory’s foggy. He can’t remember all the details from the night of the shooting. It’s imperative that he remember in order to get clues to Hugo’s whereabouts, but the more he tries, the more anxious and panicky he feels😏.It doesn’t help that Knox has Lina move next door to Nash. Not only does have to see her beautiful face everyday, but he also has to hear her whenever she’s moving around next door to him😬.Not to mention the way his body doesn’t stop reacting to HER body whenever she’s near… but then again, this might not be a bad thing either 👀. He might want commitment, and she might be afraid of it, but sometimes, the body wants what it wants 🤷🏻‍♀️😅😉.”Your gun is digging into me.” “That’s not my gun,” I said through clenched teeth. Her mouth curved wickedly. “I know.” “Then stop moving.”🥵What I loved: potential spoilers ahead—the vulnerability of both MCs❤️. Nash’s mental health took a hit when he was shot; combine that with his lack of memory afterwards= a recipe for disaster. The panic attacks he experiences are no joke; lucky for him, Lina’s around or is able to help him get through them. Lina also has her personal demons to overcome❤️. When she was in high school, she died while playing and was revived in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. She had myxomatous mitral valve disease and monitors her heart to make sure she doesn’t handle stress badly. Because of that, she feels the need to prove to people that she can do anything.Nash caught me, his hands settling on my hips and tugging me closer. I hated the fact that I instantly felt calmer. “Take a breath,” he insisted. I sucked in a tiny, useless inhalation. “You’re adorable when you freak out.”—the 🔥 tension 🔥! This is on the slow burn side (about 66% is when all magic begins), but… BUUUT… the anticipation had me panting for the grand finale 😅😉 and it was worth it 🥵. As soon as Nash sees Lina bent over trying to rescue Piper (the stray he ends up rescuing), it’s on 😎. Nash might be struggling with his mental health, but little Nash (ahem… or big Nash. Whatevs 🤣🫣) is working just fine 😉. All Lina has to do is breathe near Nash and little Nash is ready 💁🏻‍♀️”You’re gonna open your mouth for me.” “Excuse me?” I was going for haughty but it came out breathy. He dipped his head, drawing me even closer. “And I’m gonna kiss you.” “You can’t just expect—” But the man did expect. And damned if I didn’t open my mouth the second his lips hit mine.—the smeeex. Well, duh, I needed to comment on it 🤷🏻‍♀️. The buildup was delicious 🤤 and oh so worth it. That counter and those walls didn’t see them coming 😉. What’s a refractory period? Nash doesn’t know what it is 🥵thank God for small miracles 😮‍💨—the push/pullHe bared his teeth and I wondered if I imagined the low, dangerous growl. “You just keep pushing my buttons.” “And you just keep pissing me off.”👀I slapped a hand to his sweaty chest and gave a shove. He didn’t budge. Not even an inch. But his hand clamped over my wrist and then he was yanking me into him. He was a wall of heat and muscle and anger. My own fury melded with his and everything went molten inside me. “I hate how much I still want to be near you.” His voice was a low, angry rasp, like the bite of gravel on bare feet.—the first spooning scene 😅. I don't know how it all happened, how A got to B, but... I🔥WAS🔥HERE🔥FOR🔥IT!!!! It helped relieve some of the... um... tension I was feeling because of this slow burn 😉—he calls her Angel 😭🥹”Such a pretty pussy, Angel,” he said, his voice barely audible over the water.Okay. He calls her that throughout alright. It’s not just during sexy times 😅🫣—you run, I catch 😈. Gahhhh! I looove this in books (and movies too). Lina can try running from Nash, but he’s gonna go after her. Two of the most pivotal moments in the book had Nash chasing Lina, and she could only submit 🤷🏻‍♀️. I mean. Nash is VERY convincing 💁🏻‍♀️. He can convince me any time 😉🔥👀—Lucian and Sloane. Yeah. They get their own bullet. OMG THE TENSION 🔥 was just as 😮‍💨 as that of Lina and Nash! 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻. Not me looking forward to seeing side characters that haven't gotten their book yet👀. JEEEZUS... I know that their book is going to be 🔥🔥. I couldn’t help but highlight some of their interactions. It’s going to be LITTTTT (yeah. I know. It’s a trite expression, but I don’t care 🤷🏻‍♀️🤣)“Maybe he’s here to have sex with you. Like some kind of dark sexy fairy granting dirty wishes,” I teased. I noticed Knox didn’t bother greeting Lucian when he joined him. Looked like the pissed-off-ness was contagious. “I’d rather go to the gynecologist and the dentist on the same day,” Sloane said.😅🤣“You have a date?” Naomi shouted the question loud enough that all the men turned and stared at us. Lucian looked like he was about to set the world on fire with his dark smolder. “Thanks, mega mouth,” Sloane muttered. “Yes. I have a date.” “A date or a hookup?” I asked at normal volume. Lucian’s hand closed into a fist, crushing his to-go cup and exploding coffee everywhere.👀Lucian deposited Sloane next to Naomi. “Move from this spot and we’ll have problems,” he warned, looming over her with a finger in her face. “Bite me, Lucifer.”🤣Icy fire danced in Lucian’s eyes. “No one will get near her,” he promised. “She’ll probably give you shit about the attention,” I warned. Something that almost looked like a smile played over his handsome face. But then it was gone. “I won’t be run off as easily this time.”🥰Sloane paused in the open doorway. “Still up for being my date to the wedding Saturday?” she called to Nolan, who was lounging against the kitchen island. “Wouldn’t miss it for the world, cupcake.” “Pick me up at—” Lucian slammed the door, cutting Sloane off midsentence.🤣—he fell first 😅. Yup. I luuuurve it in the books I read 👀 to have the MMC (H) go craaazy for the FMC (h) always has me licking my lips 😉. Plus. Nash is relentless in his pursuit 🙃. If only all men are as dedicated as he is 💁🏻‍♀️—OMD 😈. Nash touched it so it’s his… and ONLY his. I LOOOOOVE me some delicious OMD 💅.—MINEMINEMINE and JP goodness💅. Nash has his eyes set on Lina, so she’s his and only his“I had good reason to do it the right way.” “Why’s that?” “He touched you.”—the bromance. Nash, Knox, and Lucian have already had this bromance going on for years, and now, we can add Nolan to the mix. I enjoyed the humor their interactions brought... and, well, the testosterone and fighting too 🤷🏻‍♀️—the dog rescue/adoption🥹. I mean. I’m such a suckaaaa for dogs in books 🥰. Piper’s such a sweetheart—the side characters. Um. Yes please ❤️. Not only do we see Naomi and Knox, but we see other characters as well (like Sloane and Lucian). Waylay and Waylon were adorable, as well as Lina’s parents—the moments of levity. If I’m ever kidnapped, I hope to react the way Lina did 😅 I definitely giggled when I know I shouldn’t 🤣“What happened to your face?” “It ran into my fists. Repeatedly,” Knox said as he stomped past us on his way to the water fountain.—the extended epilogue 😭❤️😭❤️ERMAGOD!!! Gahhh! I was swooning and gushing and smiling so big 🥹❤️😭. We not only see Nash and Lina, but we also see Knox and Naomi ANNNNNND Lucian and Sloane 👀What I wanted more of:—more on Nash and Knox’s dad (after the book ends)—less FTB 😑, especially when it’s the first time they do things 😐. Don’t be closing the door on me 😑—more epilogues 😭😭😭😭Overall, I loved it ❤️⚠️ safety squad⚠️-no cheating/sharing/or real owd*-mental health/depression/panic attacks-heart disorder-character with an addiction/seeking rehab-violence-H had a crush on the h from book 1.

887,"Things We Hide from the Light (Knockemout, #2)",3.5 stars! It was definitely a cute story! At times I felt like it was too long but the banter and the overall love story was very easy to adore. I can't wait for the third book! I have a feeling that book will be amazing!,3
888,"Things We Hide from the Light (Knockemout, #2)","Not me forgetting to review this book!I enjoyed it, but not as much as TWNGO. TWHFTL has a very different feel to it, mostly because Nash is dealing with PTSD and depression after what happened at the end of book 1. Most of this book is Nash dealing with the aftermath, all while lusting over his new neighbor, Lina. He adopts the most adorable dog named Piper to help with his mental health, who I loved SO much. I love reading about dogs who have big personalities in books!Lina herself is tough and badass, but has a hard time letting people in. She’s very anti-relationship whereas Nash knows he wants everything with her. I loved how the small town basically welcomed Lina with open arms and adopted her as their own. We get all the good small town feels like we did in TWNGO, with the added bonus of the suspense here being better than it was in book 1 – mostly because we get the mystery and suspense throughout the whole book, rather than all at the end.Nash is, at heart, just an absolute sweetheart who's going through a tough time. I loved how he fell first and just went head over heels when it came to Lina. We do get a ton of all the side characters, which made me so happy because we get alllll setup for Lucian and Sloane's romance, which is coming next. I CANNOT WAIT! I know I'm going to be so sad when it's here and I'll have to let go of these town and characters.*****FINALLY getting to start this! I’m ready for you Nash 💖",4
889,"Things We Hide from the Light (Knockemout, #2)","Enjoyed this! 4 ⭐️Honestly, I can see how this book isn’t for everyone. It’s looooong and slow in some parts and both main characters are a bit annoying at times.But I don’t know I fully acknowledge all that but still loved the story and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Lucy Score’s writing is magic, the banter, the sarcasm, the slow burn. 🥹",4

893,"Things We Hide from the Light (Knockemout, #2)","‎♡‧₊˚ Lucy Score never does me wrong! A beautiful and emotional small-town romance that everyone should read.I've been anticipatingThings We Hide from the Lightfor so long. I was a little bit nervous about going in, because sometimes the second book is not as good as the first book (*points at my review of Queen of Myth and Monster*). But oh my god I should have never doubted Lucy Score! This book was pure joy and enjoyment. I couldn't stop reading. I swear every time I wanted to stop to go to sleep or go do something else, the chapter ended in a way that it was impossible for me to put it down. I needed to know what was going to happen next! This book is addictive af.We return to Knockemout with Nash and Lina's story. One thing I will say that I wish it was different was Nash's profession. Man, I hate he's a cop??? Please.But all the other stuff- it delivered. The steam, the pining, the neighbors to lovers trope, the yearning and sexual tension? BANG, BANG, BANG! Spectacular, iconic, magnificent. I swear it didn't feel like an almost-600-pages romance novel. And it was an almost-600-pages romance novel lmao. I loved how domestic it was and all the scenes with the group of friend made me smile. Revisiting Knox and Naomi, meeting more characters in this little town, I wanted more if you can believe that. I love books where they give you domestic content where they're just chilling and hanging out, you know? Could they be cut? Yeah. But I love that they're in the book.I'm not going to say more about the book so you can go into it with no knowledge of anything happening lmao. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT NASH ADOPTS A TINY DOG AND HE DRESSES HER WITH CUTE OUTFITS AND TAKES HER EVERYWHERE. I love Piper so much stop.",5
894,"Things We Hide from the Light (Knockemout, #2)","i'm always a little dubious of a second book when i absolutely loved the first one but i loved this book and these characters so so so much.i'll start by saying you really need to read things we never got over first because so much of nash's personality is based off the events in twngo and things we hide from the light picks up where book one leaves off.nash morgan was the town's 'do good' police chief/golden boy who dreamed of getting married and having kids one day. but after the events in twngo, he's a shell of his former self. he doesn't feel much of anything until he sees that his new neighbor is his brother's mysterious ex, lina. lina runs from commitment at all costs but even she can't deny her attraction to nash no matter how wrong for each other they are. but, they might not even get their chance to make bad choices when loose ends from the past start haunting them again.like i said above, i wasn't sure how i was going to feel about this book but i seriously loved it just as much twngo. the pacing was perfect. their relationship was super angsty so we got so much tension and 'will they, won't they' and when they did get together, we got some suspense like we did in knox & naomi's book.nash morgan is really the best of both worlds because he used to be a golden retriever-esque, golden boy but now he's grumpy and hates everyone but he's such a softie and romantic for lina. i LOVEDDDD him. the dirty talk was phenom and he was just such a good hero. he knew he had his work cut out for him with lina and he was not afraid to put in the work, at all.lina is such a badass. sometimes i get bored with very commitment-phobic heroines because no matter what the hero does, they don't give an inch but lina was a perfect balance of hard and soft and the banter between these two was so good.i love a little bit of small town suspense and the plot twists had me on the edge of my seat. this is a slow burn but the tension leading up to it is hottttt and the spice once the burn starts burning was delish.and the best part - we get SO MANY cute knox/naomi/waylay moments. they are an integral part of this story and seeing my baby knox emotional over both of his girls was so cute. i am a sucker for grumpy/sunshine and have mommy issues like way so they will always edge out as my faves but this was seriously such a good read. i cannottttt wait for luc & sloane's story because they will be the grumpy sunshine to end all grumpy sunshines.",5
895,Demon Copperhead,"It’s barely Halloween. The ball won’t drop in Times Square for another two full months, and more good books will surely appear before the year ends. But I already know: My favorite novel of 2022 is Barbara Kingsolver’s “Demon Copperhead.”Equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking, this is the story of an irrepressible boy nobody wants, but readers will love. Damon is the only child of a teenage alcoholic — “an expert at rehab” — in southwest Virginia. He becomes aware of his status early, around the same time he gets the nickname Demon. “I was a lowlife,” he says, “born in the mobile home, so that’s like the Eagle Scout of trailer trash.” The more he grasps the connotations of words like “hick” and “redneck,” the more discouraged he becomes. “This is what I would say if I could, to all the smart people of the world with their dumb hillbilly jokes. …We can actually hear you.”Now, we can hear him.“You get to a point of not giving a damn over people thinking you’re worthless,” he says. “Mainly by getting there first yourself.”Demon is right about America’s condescending derision, but he’s wrong about his own worth. In a feat of literary alchemy, Kingsolver uses the fire of that boy’s spirit to illuminate — and singe — the darkest recesses of our country.The essential Americanness of “Demon Copperhead” feels particularly ironic given that Kingsolver has drawn her inspiration directly from one of England’s most celebrated classics: “David Copperfield,” by Charles Dickens. In a brief afterword, Kingsolver expresses her gratitude to Dickens and acknowledges....To read the rest of this review, go to The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/...",5
896,Demon Copperhead,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Demon Copperhead entered the world in a single trailer, born to a single mother who hadn’t a clue how to look after him - nor did she have the means. The southern Appalachian mountains of Virginia is where he took his first breath - a place of dire poverty, though most local folk were in the same boat, so it was pretty normal. Demon’s mum though had additional problems, and that meant even less of the basic needs for the two of them. Thank God for good neighbours.I won’t go into the synopsis as this is a lengthy (over 600 pages) and eventful novel. However, this is a tale of love and the need for love, it’s about dreams and anger, hate and pain, and what really stands out is how the opioid crisis is responsible for many of those bad feelings, and demonstrates how it wrecks the lives that might otherwise have climbed out of that daily grinding poverty, perhaps realising those long held dreams and ambitions.The journey for Demon Copperhead is long and eventful, (epic is the best way to describe it). The writing is so beautiful - exquisite even, but it takes the reader to places so dark, depressing and dangerous with its intimate detail, that you wonder why you find such beauty in it. But it’s there on every page, in every event and every crisis - harrowing yet uplifting. Has to be one of the standout books of the year - it is stunning!*Thank you to Netgalley and Faber and Faber Ltd for my much appreciated ARC. I have given an honest unbiased review in exchange *",5
897,Demon Copperhead,"This novel is described as a modern day version of David Copperfield, which I’ve never read. I’m generally not a fan of rewrites of classics, so if I had read it, I may not have picked this one up even though Barbara Kingsolver is such an amazing writer whose books I have loved over the years. I’m grateful to have read this novel because I would have missed out on a brilliant story - brutal, but brilliant and a character who was in my heart from the first to the last page .An addicted teenage mother, an abusive stepfather, a corrupt foster care system reeking of abuse is what Demon Copperhead endures at the young age of ten years old. Working on a tobacco farm, then with a family who has him sleeping in a dog room, hungry, taking leftovers from school lunch trays, he endures - somehow without speaking up to his case worker for fear of what his next foster situation would be. His next one turns out to be life altering in more ways than one. This is an in your face, in your gut punch, no holds barred portrayal all of that, and a stabbing expose of the opioid epidemic in Appalachia.It’s depressing and heartbreaking to read with little respite. I was drained at times . As with other books by Kingsolver, there is a social message here, but it’s not just told with statistics of addictions, deaths, but through the moving story of a character as a little boy and then as a young man, with all of the horrors he faced in between, feeling as real as it gets .I received a copy of this book from HarperCollins through Edelweiss.",5
898,Demon Copperhead,"Everyone and their dog has been falling all over the place expressing their love for Barbara Kingsolver’s latest release. And then there’s me . . . .I’m not here to yuck your yum so Imma keep it real short. In a nutshell, Kingsolver is an author who is consistently trying to write the “Great American Novel” and nothing demonstrates that more than her undertaking a modernization ofDavid Copperfield. In short, I just don’t think she’s my jam. Nearly 25 years agoThe Poisonwood Bibleknocked my socks off, but it’s a book I could never re-read in fear that I wouldn’t have the same reaction a second time around.My main issue with this one is that I am so over clichéd, stereotypes of Appalachia. Boy oh boy didDemon Copperheaddeliver them in spades. Our impoverished lead goes from bad to worse when it comes to an abusive household, to being orphaned, to one awful foster home situation to another (but don't worry - it ends at neglect - Kingsolver isn't ready to go to the darkest of locales when it comes to Demon's childhood). Eventually genetics get on young Demon’s side and he becomes a local high school football hero . . . until, you guessed it, his knee gets blown out and he becomes an addict. But don’t worry – he still gets a fairly happy ending and sees the ocean *eyeroll*In addition to the been there/done that feel of this entire story, you can’t re-write history in an attempt to prove how “woke” you are. A high school English teacher (and a black teacher in the middle of the Holler, at that) in the early to mid-1990s wouldn't have dared to explain the movement of literature changing the term “black” to “Black.” Not to mention how regular folks were not aware of the dangers of opioids or how Big Pharma was controlling the narrative when they first hit the market, but the nurse in here was 100% in the know of what's going down.

899,Demon Copperhead,"Now Winner of the Women's Prize for Fiction 2023 *aaargh*Joint Winner of the Pulitzer Prize 2023 with the equally simplisticTrustA twist onDavid Copperfield, focusing on an Appalachian boy whose life is overshadowed by the opioid epidemic? That sounds like a fantastic idea. And Kingsolver does a great job crafting Demon Copperhead's voice, making the resourceful boy (and later young man) sound witty, empathetic, and engaging, infusing his whole vibe with someThe Adventures of Huckleberry FinnandTo Kill a Mockingbird. Of course we're also dealing with an important topic, and Kingsolver is here to give the overlooked and left-behind a voice - but this is where the problem starts.I am not at all saying that a successful, famous writer is generally unable to convey what it means to be a person like destitute Demon in the rural South, it just doesn't work very well in this particular text, and the reason can be found in the plot itself: While Kingsolver has a lot of empathy for her characters and is obviously very upset about the societal situation - this book is rooted in her impetus for change -, everything that happens to Demon is already present in the readers' preconceived notions of socially unstable, ""backwards"" Appalachia: Teenage single mom with substance abuse issues who dies? Check. Mean step-dad? Check. Abuse in the foster system? Check. Demon gets addicted to opioids? Check.Sure, the language is often evocative due to the strong narrator Demon, but at the end of the day, Kingsolver activates stereotypes that already exist in the readers' repertoire, and then adds some social commentary (capitalism is bad; rural communities deserve respect; the Sackler family is trash, etc.), so we all can feel like we are standing on the correct side, that we who are reading this are the good ones. This unchallenging outrage activism, no matter how well-intentioned, has a tendency to be patronizing and to serve as a narcissistic tool of moral self-assurance. It's, to put it bluntly, intellectually lazy, and it certainly does not help to show people from Appalachia in a new, more nuanced light - on the contrary: It only tells us what we already believe to be true.I, for once, want literature to challenge my beliefs, especially regarding communities I am not familiar with, so groups of people that only exist as reflections in my head to begin with (I am German, but I think Appalachia is a region that is unfamiliar to many Americans as well). When a novel relies so heavily on widespread notions and then adds clichéd narrative devices (of course Demon, in the most classic of all classicBildungsromanmotifs, is also an artist; and there is the tragic twist; and a football coach; and the good-hearted grandmother, ... *argh*), it becomes rather annoying, especially because this novel is way, way, way too long. Boy, it is long. It's insane. It just goes on. And on. And then it goes on. And finally, the ending is pure kitsch.So I guess this has solid chances to get Booker-nominated as the Oprah book club crowd-pleaser with the socially relevant message that outstays its welcome and is of dubious literary merit. If so, I'm glad that I can already cross it off my list. Demon as a character is great though.",3
900,Demon Copperhead,"I waited a long time to get my turn for this book from the library. I was anticipating it with relish, because several of my trusted friends had loved it and said they, like me, had not enjoyed Kingsolver’s last few books. I was all prepared to be swept away, and I was in the beginning, but Demon has a voice that captivates you and then wears on you and then wears you out.At least Kingsolver wasn’t preaching to me in this book, but she did seem to be in love with the sound of her own voice, because she wrote pages and pages on subjects that could have sufficed with much less, and she repeated herself endlessly regarding both the lousy DSS system, the details of drug addiction, and the hopelessness of anyone who is born in the hills of Appalachia. At some point, for me, that hopelessness became a bit like the prejudice she seemed to be railing against.The first 200 pages of this book were somewhat enchanting, the middle was a slog, and the ending was not enough to make up for that. It was not a bad read, but not the 5-star read I had hoped for. Perhaps in the end, you cannot tell someone else’s story as well as they do. David Copperfield is 10-star material, Kingsolver transformed it into something just a tad over okay.I had said to myself once before that Kingsolver and I were done with one another, but this book tempted me back for another try. This time, I think, the breakup is permanent. So many other authors I want to give a fair chance.If you have the stomach for the endless beating of the opioid drum, this book will be for you. There are meant to be redeeming moments at the end, promises of better lives for a few, but those seem more like dreams, while the sinking and despair that consumed ninety percent of this book seemed all too real.",2
901,Demon Copperhead,"I think it is finally time for me to part ways with Kingsolver's books for good. I lovedThe Poisonwood Bibleback in the day, then hatedUnsheltered, and all the hype plus my love ofDavid Copperfieldconvinced me to try this one... but I'm just not feeling whatever magic everyone else did.I found the characters inDemon Copperheadto be utterly soulless and forgettable. Demon tells his life story and the narration reads like ""this happened and then this happened and then this happened"", making it impossible for me to become immersed in the story being told. Many reviewers have commented on how emotionally-connected they felt, but sadly I felt the complete opposite.The more I think about this book, the more I dislike it. I dislike how every cliched predictable thing that could happen, happens. Kid born to a junkie mom-- guess what happens? Kid gets a new stepfather-- guess what happens? Kid goes into foster care-- guess what happens? Kid becomes a star footballer-- guess what happens? Kid gets prescribed oxy-- guess what happens? Kid gets a junkie girlfriend-- guess what happens? In comes a ferocious but charming dog-- guess what fucking happens?There was a point in the middle of this book, deep in the longest dullest stretch, where Demon meets a character and I knew, I just knew, exactly what would happen to them. It's like one of those country songs that is so tragic it's slightly comical.Critics have been fawning over this book like it's such a feat of literary fiction when it literally combines every single hillbilly tragedy trope into one life story. And still, somehow, manages to be boring!Give meBastard Out of Carolinaover this any day.",2
902,Demon Copperhead,"I love Barbara Kingsolver, so I picked this as our book club selection. Then, I had the bright idea that since this was based on David Copperfield, I should try reading that first. 800 pages, dry as dirt, and I gave up at page 200. That had me worried. Until the first page of this book. OMG! The language! Her way with words is beyond description. I wanted to highlight multiple phrases per page. I quickly realized I’d be highlighting the whole book. I found myself getting caught up time after time by some phrase or sentence. She just tells it so you really understand something.This book sucked me in. Demon’s life was one long sorrowful moan. But not just his. Almost everyone in this tale has had trouble. This is a deeply depressing book. But thank heavens it ends on a note of hope for those still standing at the end.I was impressed that Kingsolver was able to take this re-telling of David Copperfield and make it about the opioid crisis in Appalachia. It shows that not much has changed between Victorian times and now when it comes to the disadvantaged being marginalized and ignored. It starts with an area with little on offer, government programs stretched beyond its limits and first one, then another, industry more interested in profits than people. The plot is a reminder that severe poverty isn’t just limited to the inner cities. If anything, there's as much prejudice against the “trailer trash”. “A blight on the nation…a smudge on the map.”I highly recommend this and it is definitely one of my favorite books of the year. I can’t wait to discuss this at book club.",5
903,Demon Copperhead,"“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end with nothing, and lose so much in between…”-	Barbara Kingsolver,Demon CopperheadBarbara Kingsolver’sDemon Copperheadis my favorite type of novel. Big and messy and sprawling; funny and tense and sad; and written by an author whose talents are awe-inspiring.This is an ambitious work, replete with striking tonal shifts, a memorable cast of secondary characters, and powerful set pieces. It has an old-fashioned feel, a bildungsroman that begins with the birth of its main character – Damon Fields, whose nickname gives the book its title – and follows him throughout a tumultuous journey into a premature adulthood. It is wildly imperfect, but its imperfections suit a larger purpose, mirroring the life it is trying to capture.As long asDemon Copperheadis – and at 560 pages, it’s pretty long – when you get to the last page, you want to keep on going. Kingsolver has created a very particular world, inhabited it with people you can’t forget, and coerced from me an emotional investment that I’m not often willing to make in fiction.***The first – and most obvious – thing to be said aboutDemon Copperheadis that it is a retelling of Charles Dickens’sDavid Copperfield, transplanted from nineteenth century England to rural Virginia during the ravages of the Purdue Pharma-sponsored opioid epidemic.It is not necessary to have read Dickens’s ponderous classic – I’ll admit, I’m only halfway through, and taking a lengthy break – and in some ways, it’s probably better that you have not. In particular, those who’ve read the original will have a very good idea about the direction Kingsolver is going, and some of the twists and turns are the same as they were over 170 years ago.On the other hand, those who are familiar with the Dickens version will have a good time matching the characters and the plot-points. Dickens’s Uriah Heep, for example, is marvelously transformed by Kingsolver into a creepy assistant football coach.***LikeDavid Copperfield,Demon Copperheadis an episodic novel, told in the first-person by our hero, a scrappy and resilient youngster for whom the past is as mysterious as the future. He is born poor in the Appalachian Mountains, to a teenage mother with substance abuse issues. Demon’s lengthy arc consists of his attempts to navigate the minefields of poverty, child protective services, drug use, foreshortened opportunities, and – of course – love.To say much more would be to say too much. It should suffice that Kingsolver does a fantastic job of utilizing a modified serial approach, so that the forward momentum ofDemon Copperheadis always urging you to read just one more page.***One of Dickens’s shortcomings – at least in my opinion – is the essential blandness of his main protagonists. It often felt like the chief focus fell on the least interesting person in his books.That is not a problem here.Demon is a fascinating creation, and holds the center from first to last. He narrates his tale in a low-key idiom that is stylized without being inaccessible. I don’t know whether Kingsolver was trying to achieve an authentic colloquial expression, and – if she was – I’m in no position to say whether she was successful. The important thing, for me, is that Demon maintained a consistent and engaging voice.From the start, we are rooting for Demon to succeed. To Kingsolver’s credit, though, she allows him to be flawed. There are moments when he is unlikeable, selfish, self-involved, and borderline awful. Allowing him these dimensions gives him a far deeper humanity than might otherwise have been achieved.That said, Kingsolver often runs into two different literary traps that I have wholly invented. The first I like to call the Idiot-Genius Paradox, wherein a character is high-functioning, intelligent, and capable, right up to the point where the storyline requires him or her to do something stupid. There is a corollary to this trap for children – let’s call it the Selectively Precocious Child Conundrum – when an author chooses to narrate a story through a youngster whose behavior and actions have only a tenuous relation to their developmental age.This is a long way of saying that one of the conceits you have to swallow is that Demon – especially early in the novel – would be able to reason and express himself at such an extraordinarily high level, given his supposed minority. And also that these preternatural talents will randomly disappear for drama’s sake.***The constellation of people around Demon is head-spinning. When we think of Dickens –ifwe think of Dickens, that is – we tend to recall his unforgettable supporting casts. At least, that’s been my experience.InDemon Copperhead, Kingsolver carries on that tradition admirably. Almost everyone who walks across Demon’s path makes an impression. Just a short list includes his mother, struggling with her addictions; an abusive stepfather who mistakes his cruelty for teaching; a child support worker with one eye on the door; an exploitative foster father trying to keep his farm afloat; a hilarious man-hating old woman; and a football coach willing to cut a few corners to achieve the status of local legend.This doesn’t even include Demon’s love interests, or Sterling “Fast Forward” Ford, who is so deftly, frighteningly drawn that I am certain that whoever plays him in the movie will earn an Oscar.***Carrying on the Dickensian tradition of social criticism, Kingsolver becomes the latest author to attempt an explanation for the failures of the rural white working class. She does this with varying levels of success.At its best,Demon Copperheadpaints a vivid picture of an overstressed child support division, schools that care more about athletics than academics, and people who can’t see a way forward. Especially effective is the interweaving of oxycontin into the storylines. It begins as a background presence, then explodes into the open, revealing a hellscape of pill farms and profit-mad drug reps working through profit-mad doctors, both in service to a rapacious corporation, leaving behind hollowed-out users cycling through withdrawal, if they’re lucky enough to survive.Unfortunately, there are times whenDemon Copperheadslips into half-conceived lectures implying that rural folk are stuck because the rest of the country is being mean to them. This is less than convincing, but maybe I’m a bit fatigued from this dialogue, which has been racing in circles since 2016.In short, I’m over trying to understand people who don’t seem that interested in understanding me.***For all their detail, Dickens’s novels always felt a tad sanitized. His slums, while slummy, were basically false, shorn of cursing, sex, violence, and excretory filth.Demon Copperheadhas all those missing elements, many times over.So, be aware of that.***When I finish a book, I never have the chance to write about it immediately. Days – even weeks – can elapse before I try to put my thoughts into complete sentences that are at least adjacent to grammatical soundness.This interim is often a good indicator of my true feelings for a book. It gives me a period to decide if my initial response – possibly skewed by the adrenal rush of finishing – holds up to reflection.When I finishedDemon Copperhead, it had me breathless. That sensation remains.There are moments, weeks later, when I find myself thinking about all the different people I met, and wondering where they went, how they’re doing, and if they’re going to be okay. I’ve even found myself staring at the finished book on my shelf, pondering whether I should open it again, just to check on everyone one last time.",5
904,Demon Copperhead,"E-Book ….and Audiobook….(read by Charlie Thurston who was absolutely as masterful reading this monumental American epic as Barbara Kingsolver was in writing it)…..21 hours long and 3 minutesBy now….most conscientious—attentive diligent readers have heard ‘something’ about this book — The New Oprah Pick - 560 pages long —Barbara Kingsolver has taken a literary classic, David Copperfield, by Charles Dickens and makes it her own.Set in the mountains of Southern Appalachia….(a neglected area of Virginia’s Appalachian Mountains)The area is home to Barbara today.A little about Barbara Kingsolver:….not only is she a best selling author of America contemporary novels, nonfiction, and poetry, but she is also a freelance journalist and political activist. With skillful talent, her writing encourages a more just world….current social issues, environmental issues, human rights, and deeply traumatic dilemmas.Her protagonists tend to be resilient— surviving day-to-day struggles…..she does this with humor to lighten the tone — love — strength —and hope.Her storytelling — mixed with political and social passion—“hope to leave the world a little more reasonable and just”….are wonderfully intimate, emotional, heartbreaking and heart endearing stories.I was a huge fan of Kingsolver’s early books…”The Bean Trees”, “Animal Dreams”, and “Pigs in Heaven”, ….that took place in Arizona where she lived for many years.When “The Poisonwood Bible” came out in 2009….(a fairly new experience for me in styling: each character taking their turn to tell the story— felt so fresh and revolutionary to me)…..taking place in Africa. I was so taken so affected by the storytelling itself…..it’s a book that has never left me.But….I have never yet read any other book that I felt accomplished that type of narrative —(a narrative circle of family characters)….I thought it was soooo brilliant….yet, since 2009,I’ve read many more authors who adopted the TAKE TURNS styling, but for me, most of the time they have a ‘paint-by-numbers’ quality to me.NOT Barbara Kingsolver! For me, she was the Queen creator of unique ‘narrative-circle’. Her crafting felt inventive & primitive — fitting to the jungle setting where a Baptist preacher took his wife and four daughters.So….clearly “The Poisonwood Bible” is still my favorite Kingsolver book…..but…..”Demon Copperhead” —with a rapturous and heroically protagonist—comes in as a very close 2nd favorite.I couldn’t agree more with this statement: “Demon is a voice for the ages—akin to Huck Finn or Holden Caulfield—only even more resilient”.Demon Copperhead reflects social and political viewpoints through realistic characters. The socioeconomic messages are felt throughout….but…it’s the nitty-gritty-bigger-than-life-immersive storytelling— with Demon ‘telling-this story’…..looking back on his coming-of-age life….that unabashedly delves into the hearts and souls of her characters — exposing something so raw and tender. Humanity is being exposed!So….ABOUT …some of those ‘nitty-gritty’ details….…..Some CHARM nitty gritty’s:….like Demon’s love for snicker bars, comics, and playing spitball with other orphan kids…..Some MAKE YOUR HEART ACHE nitty gritty’s:…..like being born into poverty by a teenage-single mother. Being tossed around from one Foster Care home to another, each worse than the next….no socks, no winter coat, lots of child labor —scrubbing and cleaning, cuttin tobacco, being called a “dead junkie’s kid”, taking crap from teachers, bullying kids, laughed at by girls, hunger….(so much hunger), opioid addiction, (damn—it was everywhere in those Appalachia mountains), ….Yet…..people were saying “a cripple was a punishment from God”?….. (what’s wrong with people?)It’s the tossing of a sentence here or there — that will spark-a-fire-in readers ‘feeling’ ANGER FOR THE CONDITIONS of life —I CAN’T IMAGINE ANY READER NOT FINDING THIS NOVEL FULLY ABSORBING—and DEEPLY AFFECTING-The full range of emotions are felt from birth into Demon’s adulthood.There are numerous themes and plot lines to contemplate….Demon’s tiny, pretty, mom, for example — she was not a bad person — she just wasn’t well. Looking through the eyes of Demon — he held onto the best parts of his mom. He loved being told that he was the best thing that ever happened to her.Demon was not only a likable child — but a forgiving character to boot (to a point)….But when his mother went and re-married a man named Stoner >>a beast of an abusive jerk, he only made Demon’s hard knock life worse.In one dialogue conversation— Demon was asked, “what he might like to do when he got older?” His replay…..was, “huh?, live”….To be a growing child with fear — to serious worry if whether or not you will survive to adulthood — let alone indulge a smudge of freedom— a taste of the American dream…is gut-wrenching.Love and hate are interwoven dangerously close together.We get clear visuals of the issues of our modern day American foster care system: homeless neglected children— victims of violence, abuse, and drug addictions are rampant.Children competing for food, hoarding food, and fighting for personal hygiene items is devastating. …..and is still a real issue.Demon was smart — he could read — draw - (superheroes of course) …and in some ways he was considered a ‘poverty- prodigy’ of sorts. But with so much abuse, addiction, poverty, betrayal all around him, without safety nets…. impoverished communities…it would take a miracle to come out on top.The ending is hopeful ……but before we get to the end —we journey through loss of innocence, alienation, isolation, cynicism, farm work, sarcasm, history, schools, shame, current events, social events, good versus evil, perseverance,— we meet other impactful characters influencing Demon’s life…(friends, Tommy, Emmy, Betsy, Dick,) Mrs. Peggot (a kind neighbor) — later in High School Coach Winfield and daughter Agnes….a football accident, a very powerful funeral that triggered memories of my own father’s funeral (he was 34- I was 4), —ongoing coming-of-age tales —New Years, new jobs, summer vacations,a love interest, Dorie, the girl Demon falls in love with ( a complicated drug-related relationship)…..It’s too easy to get to a point in life …..”where you don’t give a damn if people are thinking that you are worthless”.Everything about this book is remarkable … The descriptions, the insights, the plot structure, the treacherous hardships, epic, epic epic..stunning—- beautiful and brilliantly written!Pulitzer Prize quality!As Demon himself might say…..”Shit, and Hallelujah”!He told a damn good story!",5
905,Demon Copperhead,"Demon Copperheadis said to be inspired byDavid Copperfield, a masterpiece I read a couple of years ago. I most definitely can see that inspiration in Kingsolver’s novel. I would be hesitant, however, to make any further comparisons because for me that puts a contemporary novel on shaky ground when setting it next to a classic, beloved book. I can somehow forgive Charles Dickens for his verbosity. After all, that was the vogue back in his day.David Copperfieldwas a series of installments, stretched out over a period of time. He didn’t get paid by the word but by installment; still, he had a lot of mouths to feed. Barbara Kingsolver, on the other hand, could have done with a lot less, and I would have been a much happier reader for it. That’s not to say that her points are less important than Dickens’ themes. She absolutely had good reason to share what she did here.“That November it was still a shiny new thing. OxyContin, God’s gift for the laid-off deep-hole man with his back and neck bones grinding like bags of gravel. For the bent-over lady pulling double shifts at Dollar General with her shot knees and ADHD grandkids to raise by herself. For every football player with some of this or that torn up, and the whole world riding on his getting back in the game. This was our deliverance. The tree was shaken and yes, we did eat of the apple.”But this isn’t only about drugs and pharmaceutical companies and shady doctors taking advantage of a whole group of people. It’s also about the foster care system and how it fails those most in need of protection. It’s about the long reach of the coal mine owners and how their power reverberated across the years, affecting everything in these individual’s lives from wages to education to property and more. Someone should be held accountable, and that’s where I find Kingsolver’s work to be admirable, without a doubt. However, I still couldn’t get the author out of my head while reading this story - despite the fact it was supposedly told through a young boy-turned-young adult’s point of view. I’ve read and loved some of Kingsolver’s earlier work but have had difficulty with more of her “recent” work for the same reason. If I sense the writer sitting next to me on the couch while I read, I get a little cranky. I would much rather feel like his or her characters are having a nice heart to heart with me instead. And that brings me to another niggle - Demon’s “voice” throughout the book. I just couldn’t jibe with it. It got on my nerves A LOT!“If a mother is lying in her own piss and pill bottles while they’re slapping the kid she’s shunted out, telling him to look alive: likely the bastard is doomed. Kid born to the junkie is a junkie. He’ll grow up to be everything you don’t want to know, the rotten teeth and dead-zone eyes, the nuisance of locking up your tools in the garage so they don’t walk off, the rent-by-the-week motel squatting well back from the scenic highway.”I don’t mind gritty but what I couldn’t quite wrap my head around was who on earth is speaking these words? Supposedly, this is Demon as a young boy at the start of the story (the above passage occurs on page 2). Is this a super savvy kid speaking? Or is it Demon as an old man looking back and narrating? Or is it Kingsolver trying really hard to create a voice she feels is authentic? I don’t know, honestly. But it happened over and over again to me throughout the 500+ pages. It's like nails on a chalkboard!Okay, I’ll lay off the complaining now. This is, after all, a 3-star book in my mind so there has to be another good thing or two, right?! What I loved most were the strong women in Demon’s life. Without them, I’m afraid to imagine Demon’s fate. In these Appalachia stories, I’ve often found that the women are the ones holding down the fort. It’s their strength and perseverance in the face of adversity that forms a safety net for those they care for most. And I can see where these women equate to those in Dickens’ story as well. This makes for a bit of fun, but you surely don’t need to read his book to understand this one. It just adds another level perhaps. There’s even a passage in here where Demon nods to that famous work.“I had to do the harder English, which was a time suck, reading books. Some of them though, I finished without meaning to… Likewise the Charles Dickens one, seriously older guy, dead and a foreigner, but Christ Jesus did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over and nobody giving a rat’s ass. You’d think he was from around here.”I’ll say that this is an important topic to explore. Personally, it would work better if it had been edited more thoroughly. Yes, a shorter story can still make a huge impact. I also think a non-fiction piece on the opioid crisis would be a lot more effective for me. I know they are out there, and I will explore that option more thoroughly. Now, would I have loved this more if Richard Armitage had been reading it to me as he didDavid Copperfield? Damn straight I would have!! He could have read another 500 pages of this one to me and I’d have been content.“It hit me pretty hard, how there’s no kind of sad in this world that will stop it turning.”",3
906,Demon Copperhead,"Who is this Demon Copperhead?? Well, let me tell you: He’s a wild red headed melungeon, whipper snapper of a hillbilly. A young boy with a mind so expansive, how he describes life, is large.Orphaned at 11, Demon’s teenage years are fraught with sadness and hopelessness. Through foster homes, running away and at last finding his grandmother. A life headed to go off the rails, somehow maintained its balance, until it didn’t. As in life, there are tops and bottoms. In Demon’s, the bottom bottoms out with opiates- plundering his chances of making it out of poverty.Demon is a character you will grow attached to and cheer for in his early ages simply for his resilience. But life can be tough and heavy choices are made.Kingsolver, you haven’t lost your touch. This one is epic. This character; this story; the writing. But whoa. It does get dark and heavy for a long part of this journey and it makes one wonder of the helplessness and fear these addicts feel and face in reality.5⭐️Your 2nd story to grace my all time favourites standing next toThe Poisonwood Bible",5
907,Demon Copperhead,"Can't carry on unfortunately - DNF after 150-odd pages. The thought of proceeding with this one filled me with dread. For me, there are two massive indicators of a troubled reading experience 1) No matter what time of day, one feels sleepy after reading 10 pages and 2) The thought of picking up the book fills one with dread.I found the story tedious, the narrator and the style of narration grated on my nerves - and I didn't really have any interest in what was happening.Sorry - this one beat me.",1
908,Demon Copperhead,"5+I am far from the first one to be blown away by this phenomenal book. How can one novel be heart-breaking, beautiful, amazing, poignant, and funny? Barbara Kingsolver lives in these mountains she writes about, this area of southern Appalachia that is a place of immense beauty but which is known more for its poverty, unemployment, and addiction. The Appalachian people, people who are often ridiculed for their rural ways and particular speech.“All down the years, words have been flung like pieces of shit, only to get stuck on a truck bumper with up-yours pride. Rednecks, moonshiners, ridgerunners, hicks, deplorables.”Kingsolver writes from the heart with love and understanding. She has written many fine books but, in my opinion, this is her best since The Poisonwood Bible.Rather than retell the story (No! No! Please don’t!), I will share some of my favorite quotes. Please realize these are just a sampling of the many I might have included.“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end up with nothing, and lose so much.”“I wanted to go home, which was nowhere, but it’s a feeling you keep having, even after that’s no place anymore.”“I’d live long enough to know shit doesn’t bounce off.”“Certain pitiful souls around here see whiteness as their last asset that hasn’t been totaled or repossessed.”“A junkie catches his flight. That sugar on your brain cells sucks away any other purpose. The human person you were gets yanked out through whatever hole the devil can find.”“I thought about what Rose said, wanting to see the rest of us hurt, because she was hurting. You have to wonder how much of this whole world’s turning is fueled by that very fire.”“That’s the deal of sober life: celebrate the fresh start, suck up your sadness for all that was left behind”.I hope those who haven’t read this masterpiece will love it too.",5
909,Demon Copperhead,"Demon Copperhead deserves every fiction prize there is. Every single one of them. Even the ones that don't exist.Many years ago, shortly after I started working at my library, I mentioned to a colleague I had a headache.""Mabel"", sweet and helpful as ever, said to come back to her desk and she'd give me something for it. She pulled out a gallon-size Ziploc bag (that's almost 4 liters, for all the non-United Statians reading this).Mabel asked me what kind did I want. 'Um, ibuprofen?' I queried, not seeing anything but orange prescription bottles in that see-through plastic bag.She looked at me and said she didn't have it but any of these pills would help a lot more than ibuprofen would.I declined, worried to take prescription painkillers. I worried forher, seeing that big ol' bag.""You don't take all of these,do you, Mabel?"", I asked.She said well of course she did, ""Jenna, when you get old, you get a lot of different pains and each of these are for a different one"".With that, Mabel began pulling out bottles, reading the labels as she did. ""This here's for my neck. This for my back. Oh, this is the best, it helps my arthritis,"" she said, shaking a bottle of Oxys.She continued pulling out bottles, lining them up on the edge of her desk. I thinkjust about every part of her body hurt and every part of her body had its own pill.A white-haired, intelligent, professionally employed woman, Mabel wasn't your stereotypical addict. She had been a librarian for decades, the favorite of most of our patrons. But,like every other pain pill addict I knew, Mabel's addiction began in the doctor's office.She wasn't some lowlife just looking to get high. She trusted her doctors and believed them that you couldn't get addicted if you really had pain.There are so many stories about addiction, some true, some based on the truth. Mabel, while not her real name, was a real person with a real addiction that probably killer her (she had a brain aneurysm which are often brought on by opioids). Not all stories have happy endings.As for this book and this story, I loved it. Loved it in so many ways and for so many reasons. Barbara Kingsolver, being Appalachian, ""gets"" Appalachians, us hillbillies. She writes with so much authenticity.These characters? I know them. They live down the street, they come in the library, they shop at Walmart, pushing their ""buggies"" full of sugar drinks and sugar cereals, trying to get the most amount of calories for their kids for the least amount of dollars.Ms. Kingsolver also ""gets"" the pain pill/heroin epidemic, how and why it started, and how greedy pharmaceutical CEOs and everyone under them, down to both the equally greedy doctors and the well-meaning but witless ones, destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives.There is a lot about addiction in these pages, but there's so much more than that. It is real and deep and emotional andrip-your-heart-out stuff. It is whatHillbilly Elegycould have been if JD Vance wasn't such a stuck on himself braggart asshole.Young Demon Copperhead had me from the very first page.I knew this kid, I'd seen him grow up, and watched him grow up all over again through the pages of this book. I cannot praise it highly enough, trite as those words are. It's difficult to find words to describe it - again trite, but the truth.If you want a book that is going to suck you in and hold you rapt and take you on a roller coaster of emotions,Demon Copperheadis the book for you. Don't be intimidated by the length. As another friend wrote in her review (hey, Diane 👋🏼), ""it needs every word to get this story told.""",5
910,Demon Copperhead,"3.75⭐*Joint Winner of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction with Hernan Diaz's Trust **Winner of the 2023 Women’s Prize for Fiction*“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end with nothing, and lose so much in between.”A retelling of David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, in a contemporary Southern Appalachian setting,Demon CopperheadbyBarbara Kingsolveris a powerful work of fiction. Part coming of age, part social commentary, the narrative revolves around the eponymous Demon Copperhead, born Damon Fields, (named after his father Damon, who died from an accident before his birth, earning the nickname “Copperhead” on account of his copper wire hair) to an addict mother in a trailer park in Lee County, Virginia. We follow Demon from his childhood through his early adulthood, as he grapples with poverty, loss, abuse, loneliness, and short-lived moments of hope and success as a young athlete with college dreams before an injury derails his plans and his struggle with addiction and substance abuse. Narrated in the first person by Demon, as he shares his perspective on the people and events that shape his life and his worldview, this is a story of grief, resilience and ultimately the search for a sense of belongingness and the will to survive when the odds are stacked against you.“It hit me pretty hard, how there’s no kind of sad in this world that will stop it turning. People will keep on wanting what they want, and you’re on your own.”Rather than compare this novel to the classic that inspired this story, I prefer to discuss what I felt about this book based on its individual merit.There is a lot to unpack here. The author writes with compassion in simple yet elegant prose. Barbara Kingsolver not only paints the picture of the lives of those caught up in a vicious cycle of poverty, neglect and addiction, the Opioid Crisis in particular but also takes a grim look at issues such as parental negligence, child abuse and the foster care system among others. The characterizations are superb and the author skillfully weaves a large cast of distinctive characters into the narrative without it becoming overwhelming or too difficult to follow. The author also addresses how outsiders harbor certain preconceived notions about certain communities without totally understanding the challenges they face.I was engrossed in Demon's journey for the first half of this novel, after which the repetitiveness caused the pace to falter but it does pick up in the last quarter of the story. There are segments in the narrative that I felt were unnecessarily detailed and could have been shorter without affecting the overall impact of the novel.Though the story is dark and depressing for the most part, it is peppered with moments of humor and hope amid the bleakness that pervades Demon’s life and ends on a hopeful note.This was my first Barbara Kingsolver novel and I look forward to exploring more of her work.“But where did it come from, this wanting disease? From how I got born, or the ones that made me, or the crowd I ran with later? Everybody warns about bad influences, but it’s these things already inside you that are going to take you down. The restlessness in your gut, like tomcats gone stupid with their blood feuds, prowling around in the moon- dead dark. The hopeless wishes that won’t quit stalking you: some perfect words you think you could say to somebody to make them see you, and love you, and stay.”",4
911,Demon Copperhead,"The excellent cover design first drew me to this book. I thought a modern adaptation of the classic David Copperfield would be a formidable task. When I saw it was written by Barbara Kingsolver, who wrote three of my favourite books, all wildly different in theme and location, The Poisonwood Bible, The Lacuna, and Flight Behaviour, I knew I wanted to purchase and read this. This is unlike her other books that enthralled me. It is an epic tale (over 600 pages) and a fabulous read. Its characters, the good, the wicked, the uncaring, and the disinterested, will stay in my memory for a long time.Demon (Damon) Copperhead was born to a teenage, addicted mother on the floor of her trailer. They faced extreme poverty in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia. The story follows Demon from his birth to young manhood. The writing is exquisite, although describing dark and disturbing circumstances. Demon narrates his life story, often with a sardonic sense of humour about deplorable situations. His father died before his birth, and Demon inherited his father's good looks and flaming red hair (Copperhead). His mother remarried a vile, abusive, violent man. Kindly neighbours, the Piggotts, were an early refuge for him, and the family also cared for other orphaned or forgotten children from dead or absent relatives.At age ten, Demon finds himself in the foster system when his mother dies. The system's workers were overburdened and usually uncaring, overlooking terrible situations where they placed their charges. He finds himself working on a farm with several orphaned boys, treated as slave labour, poisoned by the sap from tobacco plants, and nearly starved. Then he is moved to the McCobbs, sleeping in a dog's room, and expected to earn money by working outside the home to supplement the family's income. He rarely can attend school, and when he does, it reinforces his low self-esteem. Always hungry and poorly dressed, he is shunned by his classmates. He works in the trash after school and seldom is clean.Things start to look better when he moves into the home of a football coach who is determined to make a football player out of Demon for his winning team. He feels unworthy even in his short glory days as a football player. A painful injury on the sports field ends his brief football career and starts him on pain medication and the road to addiction. He becomes friends with Angus, the coach's teenager.Demon becomes reacquainted with an old friend from the miserable farm where they both laboured. This friend works for a local newspaper laying out ads and cartoon strips. Demon helps him by creating a superhero from the Appalachian region, as all the superheroes are drawn with their exploits in cities. The cartoon strip became very popular and is syndicated to other regional papers. One kindly art teacher recognizes Demon's talent for drawing cartoons and supports his efforts.However, things are going badly for Demon outside the newspaper office. He has married a girl he thinks is adorable. She is clingy and needy, will not cook or clean the house, and appliances have long stopped functioning. They live in filthy, nasty conditions, and she has fallen deep into drug addiction. She becomes distraught and angry if he leaves home to run errands or go to work. His memories of earlier injustices and poverty flood his mind and emotions with despair.His old friends are now part of the opioid and meth crisis, and Demon joins them. His best friend from the Piggott home is far into drugs and weird Gothic dress, and he and the once popular QB football hero are dealing. Former friends start dying from overdoses and reckless behaviour. Are there any supportive people who will save some of the addicted youth? Will Demon find a way out of his tragic past?We learn something about the region's history, the coal mining, those impoverished, marginalized people scorned by others and designated hillbillies and rednecks. ( a word with an interesting origin),and with social situations little improved since the time of Charles Dickens.Demon comments on David Copperfield, one of the few books he managed to read in school, "" The Charles Dickens one seriously old guy, dead and a foreigner, but Christ Jesus did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over, and nobody gives a rat's ass. You'd think he was from around here.""Highly recommended!",5
912,Demon Copperhead,"I know some readers want a novel to be concise, revised down to your basic 300-ish pages, but what a luxurious feeling it is when you find yourself more than 300 pages into a book that is really engaging, with characters you truly care about, and realize there are more than 500 pages left to go. You get to know the people in these books better, maybe see them grow over a longer period of time. You get to know the whole world of the book better. But that makes it even sadder when you finish it.I loved this book, a modern Appalachian retelling of David Copperfield, another very long book that I really liked. Kingsolver is good at both seriousness and playfulness, as Dickens was, and she cares deeply about backwoods, rocky Virginia. This works for me, too- I never lived in Appalachia, but I have deep family roots in West Virginia, and I care about that part of the world. I got invested in young Demon (a nickname for Damon) quickly and cared about him all the way through. Even when he makes awful mistakes in this book, he’s a loving person, and I think his worst mistakes are made out of love. He’s good at making connections with people who might save him, too, and he’s generous with the people in his life even when things are unbelievably hard. I like how Demon, even when he’s going through something terrible, notices and is buoyed by the beauty of the natural world. The sense of place is strong in this book. The characters are even stronger, and you care about them deeply as they suffer in the eye of the opioid storm that still wracks our country. I’ve read almost all of Kingsolver’s books, and I think this has replaced The Poisonwood Bible as my favorite. As always when I’m truly loving a book, I worried about the ending. Would the author stick the landing? I am haunted by the ghosts of a few books that just lost it at the end. But she stuck the landing! I love where the book ends.Now I kind of feel like going back and rereading David Copperfield? It’s been a while. Thanks to NetGalley for giving me early access to my favorite book of the year.",5
913,Demon Copperhead,"Smart, surprising, poignant, powerful, wrenching, and wonderful. So deeply moving. I will never write a novel this good. Drop the mic, Barbara Kingsolver, drop the mic.",5
914,Demon Copperhead,"Very powerful coming of age story of a boy who the odds were set against from the start.Demon was born to a drug abusive, single teenaged mother.. in the single wide trailer they lived in, in the mountains of southern Appalachia.The trailer was owned by the Peggot’s a large family who lived next door and played a big part in his survival most times.A story of how the opioid drugs moved into this region and destroyed the lives of family members and friends, actually the whole community ..Demon’s journey through foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success and then addiction following an injury… just crushing losses.This story is about serious issues but was laced with many really funny moments, which I really enjoyed.I just loved Demon’s character! This is a long book.. but I could have just kept reading about Demon and his life.I listed to about half of this book on audio and the narrator was fantastic!My first Kingsolver.. I’ll be checking out her other books!",5
915,Demon Copperhead,I've seen almost only raving reviews on this one but unfortunately I just not one of those who loved the book. It's good writing and all that but just did nothing ro draw me in and evoke strong emotions. At the same time I can see why so many others likes it,3
916,Demon Copperhead,"“Likewise the Charles Dickens one, seriously old guy, dead and foreigner, but Jesus Christ did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over and nobody giving a rat’s ass. You’d think that he was from around here.”A modern retelling of Charles Dickens's David Copperfield bildungsroman set in the Appalachian Mountains, where you are plunged into a harsh and unforgiving world of institutional poverty, addiction, and social injustice. Through the eyes of Damon Fields, nicknamed ""Demon Copperhead,"" Kingsolver exposes the dark underbelly of modern American society with a raw and visceral prose, with a bleak and apocalyptic vision of the world that is both terrifying and all too familiar.“Once a time I was something, and then I turned, like sour milk. The dead junkie’s kid. A rotten piece of American pie that everybody wishes could just be, you know. Removed.”Kingsolver's sprawling narrative weaves together a complex tapestry of characters and storylines that reflect the harsh realities of contemporary life. Her storyline is unflinching, painting a picture of a society that has lost its way and is struggling to find its moral compass; a long tradition of suffering that divides and isolates. Kingsolver's socio-political message is complemented by the splendid prose and southern undertones which contribute to the realistic representation of the simple, ordinary life of the mind of a teenage boy and his upbringing in the harsh Appalachian environment.This is a heartfelt exploration of the search for meaning in a chaotic word. The fate of Demon, a throwdown of shame, a cesspool of self-pity, will intersect with that of many others, echoing the stories of all those haunted by the ghosts of a repressive past.“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end with nothing, and lose so much in between.��In the end, as you embark on this journey with Demon through loss of innocence, alienation, isolation, cynicism, but also of fortitude and perseverance, you are reminded of the timeless truths that lie at the heart of all great stories.“…a good story doesn’t copy life, it pushes back on it.”Brillant!4.75/5",5
917,Demon Copperhead,"""First, I got myself born. A decent crowd was on hand to watch, and they've always given me that much: the worst of the job was up to me, my mother being let's just say out of it.""I knew from that first sentence I would love this book. I knew by page 50 that it would be five stars, by page 75 my favorite book of the year. Having finished, I'm moving it up to one of my lifetime favorite books. It really is that good, that moving, that perfect. That's a lot from an author that had disappointed me with her last few books. Kingsolver never got past her wonderful Poisonwood Bible success with me, and after a couple of later books, I just gave up on her. I wanted to try this because of the David Copperfield connection. I last read that in high school,many long years ago, but give Dickens credit, I still remembered the plot and the characters, and of course, their names. Kingsolver takes David/Demon and plops him down in present day Appalachia, and never misses a beat. Having said that, even if you never even heard of David Copperfield, this is a great novel on its own.I'll let the GR blurb give you the basics. Just get this book in your hands and read it. I will even go so far as to say it will probably win everything, certainly the National Book Award, most likely the Pulitzer. It will certainly win your heart. I got mine from the library, but will buy a copy when it comes out in paperback. Don't let the fact that it's 540+ pages deter you, it needs every word to get this story told.Now I need to reread David Copperfield, just for the icing on the cake.",5
918,Demon Copperhead,"While this is a re-telling of David Copperfield you certainly don’t have to be familiar with Dickens’ novel to be moved by Kingsolver’s version. Taking place in Southern Appalachia rather than Victorian England the same set of horrifying tragedies still exist with the addition of the opioid crisis that particularly plagues the south. As you might imagine this is not a cheerful read but it provides a scathing look at a forgotten population told by a perceptive and canny red-haired kid who has had more than his share of poverty, starvation, crummy foster homes and losses. He is a hero worth rooting for. A must read.",5
919,Demon Copperhead,"5+ stars!2023 Favourites List!Demon Copperhead is a ten-year-old boy living in a single wide trailer with his young mother in the back Holler of the Appalachian mountains in Virginia. This is Demon’s story. He tells his story starting from the day he was born to a teenage mother too young to know anything about parenting and too focused on getting her next fix of alcohol, drugs and bad men. Demon chronicles his life of poverty, foster care, crime, filth, abuse and loneliness. There are bright spots throughout the way, but nothing that could shine clear through the constant neglect and heartbreak this young boy faces.As dark and disturbing as this story is, it was a phenomenal reading experience for me. Truly - it was an exceptional and outstanding novel that surpassed any expectation I had. For me, the most stand out aspect was the narrative. Demon’s voice is one I’ll never forget. The author created a fascinating, impactful, endearing and heartbreaking character in Demon, giving him a voice that sent his story right to my heart. Demon’s narrative is raw and gritty. It’s filled with slang and backwoods grammar. It’s authentic and real and had me enraptured. There were many sentences of tender raw honesty from Demon that went straight to my heart.You’ll be able to quickly decide if this book is for you based on how you feel about Demon’s narrative. If you don’t connect with his voice and backwoods drawl within the first few pages, this won’t be for you.There is so much that happens within these pages. It is a dark, gritty, heartbreaking read. The endless cycle of poverty and abuse is depressing but a reality many children face. I appreciate getting this harrowing glance into this life as it makes me even more thankful for what I have and encourages me to help others as much as possible.Overall, this was a remarkable book that I highly recommend! I hope you connect with Demon’s story as much as I did.",5
920,Demon Copperhead,"This book is full of potential triggers especially for those in recovery.There are very few books I will say deserve more than5🌟 but Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver is one of them. Another, I seldom re-read books. I am ready to start again. Lastly, 21 hour book should have taken me 4-5 days to complete by audio. Not only did I complete in 3, but i was never waiting for it to endNow on to the book. It was fantastic. I had no idea what it was about. Lots of mixed reviews. It begins in first person with little dialog. Huge turn-off for me. I feel like I am being read to. But no. It fit it was perfect. This author did an amazing job making everything I don’t like just work! WoW!Damon is a 10-11 year old boy who is raised in a home by a mother who is an addict. She has an abusive boyfriend. She dies. At the age of 11 Damon is introduced to the foster care system. The book follows Damon through his life. Lots of death, suicide, alcohol, drugs. Heroin.Being an addiction counselor, I was fascinated with his sheer will to survive. Working in a Methadone clinic I was interested in his inner thoughts and feelings as Heroin and Oxy played in his life. From Rags to Living. Demon Copperhead was a book that taught me and fascinated me alike.Book is dedicated:To the survivors. So to the survivors of the hell we walk through in life.I am proud to be a survivor. I am proud to help others survive!It is vein to recall the past unless it works some influence upon the present ~Charles Dickens, David Copperfield",5
921,Demon Copperhead,"It’s not often you look forward to Demons, but in this case, I was. All the sterling reviews on Goodreads! The fortuitous link to my favorite Dickens novel (David Copperfield)! The promise of one of my favorite genres, coming-of-age!Alas, it was not to be. At least not for me.It fell into that category of book that for some reason bothers me. The plot’s the thing, and we all love a good story. As for Kingsolver, she’s certainly capable of telling it. Trouble is, she told way more than I like. Not many “stop and zoom in” scenes. More ""this happened, then that happened."" And time rolls on as the narrative years slip by.Guess I’d rather read a book that covers all of a day or a weekend only. That’s me. These year-jumpers tend to leave characterization in the dust. That is, the characters have no soul, and when they have no soul, I have trouble investing (making the book bankrupt as a Silicon Valley Bank, if you’ll forgive the current event metaphor).In fairness, you can dismiss this review because I DNF, but I did make it to page 380 or so, and that’s more than halfway, by God, but I struggled to return to it each time I put it down. Instead, I looked at other books on my TBR shelf and they mocked me for pledging my allegiance in such a rote way. Soon I caved to the Sirens of “Life’s Too Short.”I don't feelthatbad. Demon seems to be doing just fine and meeting unusual success and winning over all the girls and facing all the modern troubles (like opioids) David C. didn’t have to and I wish him well. But he really lacked depth. And the surrounding characters didn't sweep me off my feet, either, meaning I was always aware of my surroundings while reading (never a good thing -- consider the movie theater when the same thing happens while viewing!).So cue the music by the men in Wayfarer sunglasses (“I’m a Soul Man”) and forgive me not joining the Kingsolver parade. I’ll leave the 5-stars and hosannas to others with their marching band reviews.Instead, I’ll be one of the outsiders giving this a two. Leaving it has hard, but I’m glad I did now that the doing’s done.",2
922,Demon Copperhead,"3.5 rounded up to 4.In Lee County, Virginia in the late 1980’s, a baby named Damon Fields is born in a trailer (his birth somewhat dramatic and unusual), to a single teenage alcoholic mother. Damon quickly morphs into Demon, and the name assigned to him, Copperhead, he chooses to continue to use as a tribute to his father, who died before he was born.For the first ten years of his life,Demon Copperheadlives a poverty-stricken, unorthodox childhood, albeit a happy, safe and fairly stable one. Until tragedy sees him being sent to a series of foster homes.Narrated entirely by Demon – his strength of character, enduring, resilience spirit, and ability to find humour in any situation that was thrown at him, made this an unforgettable read. The material was bleak, graphic, hard-hitting and honest, but comic relief injected into the writing prevented things from ever becoming too depressing to handle. Demon’s coming-of-age epic journey into adulthood saw me feeling every emotion under the sun. Modernised and loosely based onCharles Dickens,David Copperfield, which I’ve been meaning to read but haven’t yet gotten around to, therefore am unable to compare the two. To me,Demon Copperheadgave meThis Tender LandbyWilliam Kent Krueger, andLemony Snickel’s A Series of Unfortunate Events(sans magical fantasy) vibes. In fact, the writing itself was similar toWilliam Kent Krueger(an author I love) although the tone was darker. Also, unlikeKrueger’swork, there was profanity and salty language, which I can take-it-or-leave-it, but I know some don’t care for it, so thought I’d better mention it.I listened to the entire633 pagesviaaudioborrowed fromLibby Overdrive, and the narrator,Charlie Thurstonwas the perfect choice to voiceDemon Copperhead. His tone, emotion, and character accents really brought the written material to life, as well as heightened my amusement ever further than what reading it myself would have.The first 40% was exciting, addictive, and unforgettable. But, after that Demon’s character arc went in a direction that to me slowed the overall pace, and caused the book to drag. I really think that section could’ve been condensed down. At about 60% things did pick up again, but didn’t reach the impacting heights of first 300 pages.Mary Bethand I buddy readDemon Copperhead, and like many other reviewers she deemed it worthy of all the stars. Initially I felt the same, but the wheels slowly fell off for me as the book progressed. The subject matter was powerful and important, but if I’m honest, It all got a bit tired. I actually feel a bit guilty that I didn’t find the themes in the last half as impactful as I probably should have. I’d definitely recommend giving it a read though, especially given how strong the first 40% was, and because most who have read it have raved over it in its entirety.",4
923,Demon Copperhead,"In a Nutshell:A contemporary retelling of the Dickens’ epic, ‘David Copperfield’. True to the original in flow, but the rest left me with mostly negative feelings. Outlier opinion coming up.Story Synopsis:Think ‘David Copperfield’ in a modern-day hillbilly setting.Damon Fields was born to a teenage druggie mom in a trailer home. Because of the colour of his hair and his attitude towards life and people, he is nicknamed ‘Demon Copperhead.’ As Demon grows up in Lee County in the Virginian Appalachian region, he fights against his destiny and tries to make something of himself, though the odds keep going against him.The story comes to us in the first person perspective of Demon.I remember the dilemma I had faced while reviewingLan Samantha Chang’s The Family Chao, which was a modern-day retelling of Dostoevsky’sThe Brothers Karamazov. While her adaptation had been faithful to the original, the classic itself was not suitable to a modernisation by virtue of its themes and its philosophy. This made her novel seem highly stereotypical and even offensive.I face a similar conundrum this time, thoughCharles Dickens’ classic ‘David Copperfield’is much more flexible towards an updated retelling because of its universal themes.If you have read the original epic, you will notice how faithfully and brilliantly Barbara Kingsolver has transported the characters to the Appalachian mountains. All the characters get a similar deal as in the original, albeit through a different approach thanks to the change in era and setting.The characters have been given somewhat similar names as their older counterparts. Murdstone becomes Muller Stone, Steerforth becomes Sterling ford, Dora turns into Dori, Tommy Traddles is now Tommy Waddell… This kind of writing choice makes it very easy for us to remember whom each new character is based upon. (That said, I was not at all happy to see my favourite Agnes being changed to ‘Angus’.)David Copperfield was the titular character’s coming-of-age story; Demon Copperhead is also a bindungsroman for its eponymous lead. Both characters are equally gutsy and equally judgemental. Both want to succeed despite the lemons life keeps throwing at them, and contrary to expectations, they do end up carving a niche for themselves in this haphazard world.The plot is also faithful to the original. No one’s destiny changes paths just because of the modernisation. This is both good and bad. Good because I really respect authors who retain the spirit of the original in their retellings. (There’s no point calling a work a retelling if you retain nothing of the base work except the character names, right?) Bad because you already know what’s going to happen to every single one of them!In other words, as a retelling, this book rates pretty high because it sticks to the format and still gives it enough of a twist to make it stand on its own as an independent work.Where the book failed for me is in its tawdry portrayal of the mountain people. Don’t get me wrong. Kingsolver is a master at settings, and this book is no exception. The mountains of Lee County come alive through her beautiful descriptions. But it was somewhat disappointing to see every possible stereotype about the locals make its way into this book. This is somewhat ironic because Demon tells us multiple times how he feels upset about the stereotypes outsiders have about his people, and then he goes on to live a life reiterating every single cliché through his own deeds, which sounds even worse when heard in first person. Drugs, alcohol, sex, cuss words, poverty, physical violence, domestic violence, social backwardness, racial discrimination ,… you name it and it is there in this book. I am not going to remark on how much of this might be based on reality as I have no first-hand experience of that culture and hence have no right to judge. But from the way it was portrayed, I got hardly any good vibes about the community, and that it is a sure sign that only hackneyed ideas were being thrown at us.Dickens’ work was also somewhat “misery porn” in style and slightly offensive against those not “physically perfect.” But as David Copperfield was written in the late 1840s, it gets away with this outdated style of writing. Demon Copperhead cannot use the era as an excuse. As it is a retelling, I am also taken aback by the amount of vulgarity in the story. This might not bother most readers, but to me, inserting crude content into a favourite classic story was akin to blasphemy.How would you feel about this book without knowing the original? Well, you might like it better as you won’t keep comparing the two works and will read this one on its own merit. So if you are okay with the ribald content and the vapid portrayal of the hillbilly people, this story *might* work better for you. Then again, the book is needlessly lengthy, because it skips nothing from the original plot. The start is appealing, but the middle is quite repetitive. The story stays stuck in this looped narrative until almost the very end, by which time I had lost all my patience with it.To me, the book feels like an epic writing achievement in some ways, transporting 1800s upper class London to a modern hillbilly setting. But in most other ways, it feels so unbelievably flat and so offensive to the original as well as to the contemporary dwellers of the location that I cannot endorse it wholeheartedly.2.5 stars, rounding down because I expected far more from Ms. Kingsolver.Do note that this is very much an outlier review. So please read other reviews and take a call on this joint-winner of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Connect with me through:My Blog|The StoryGraph|Instagram|Facebook|Twitter",2
924,Demon Copperhead,"Barbara Kingsolver’s reworking of David Copperfield as a tale for our times is a masterful portrayal of what it can be like for a child to be born and grow up amongst the poorest and most marginalised in America today. Children who are labelled as society’s dregs and treated as if they are in some way lesser beings because their clothes are ragged and they are always hungry.Damon Fields, nicknamed Demon Copperhead (for his red hair), is a child born to a single teenage mother living in a trailer, his father dead before his birth, in Lee County in the Virginian Appalachians. While his mother struggles with drug addiction and is in and out of rehab, Demon is also cared for by the kindly Peggot family next door, grandparents bringing up their own grandson whose mother is in prison. He learns to love the wild forests, to hunt and fish and what it’s feels like to be part of a large family. However, when he is ten, Demon’s world really falls apart when his mother marries an abusive man with no interest in raising a child. This is the start of a downhill spiral for Demon that leads to the nightmare of foster care, where he is expected to work to earn his keep, never given enough to eat or provided with bigger clothing as he grows. After he hits his lowest point, a change in fortune will find him in a better place but, with a baggage of neglect, abuse and poverty, he’s not equipped to weather the storms still to come and is in danger of repeating the cycle of addiction and poverty.However, even at his lowest point Demon never loses his will to survive or to see the best in people. His ability to draw and conjure up superheros with the power to save the weak and downtrodden is his richest possession and along with his sense of humour and intelligence keeps him going in the toughest of times. This is a long book and I did find it slow down in the latter half when Kingsolver is fully laying out the causes and effects of the opiod crisis in America, particularly in marginalised populations, such as in poor rural areas where there is high unemployment and people are told they are worthless. However, sad and depressing Demon’s story is, it felt very real and hopefully will lead to better understanding of what it is to be caught up in poverty through no fault of your own, poorly educated and without hope and told you are worthless, with the lure of drugs one way to make it all go away for a while. Demon is a character I will not easily forget in this insightful and provocative novel. 4.5★With thanks to Faber & Faber via Netgalley for a copy to read",5
925,The Woman in Me,"11/25: UPDATE because it feels necessary to say after a few incredibly rude comments. You canrespectfullydisagree with my review all you want but if you are leaving a disparaging comment towards me, don't waste your time. The moment that you start personally attacking me, your comment will be deleted and you will be blocked because I won't tolerate it :) We can have different opinions on a book and still respect each other AND each others' opinions. Let's act like adults.________________________________________________Nobody wants to be the bad guy and give this memoir a low rating so I guess it will be me.Britney has been through hell and reading this story is incredibly sad. God, I feel for her. Imagine being locked up for all of your 30s, never being able to make a decision for yourself, and being re-released into the world in your 40s; imagine having to reinvent yourself and reshape your identity after all of that… It’s unfortunate that, when she was younger, she never had someone to hold her hand and help her when she was going through her darkest moments and clearly suffering from mental illness. Hallelujah that she made it out on the other side of her conservatorship. I'm proud of her BUTThis isn't even close to a five star read for me. People are going to call this the best memoir of the year and they are entitled to that opinion. As someone who spends a lot of time reading memoirs though, I can't help but feel that this one doesn't even come close to ""the best"". But I get it... I get the urge to give five stars regardless because her life was extremely challenging and it's impossible to imagine how someone could make it through something like she did. I almost did. But I am not rating her life or worthiness here, my friends. I never am when I rate a memoir. I am here to rate the BOOK and the book alone. With that said...→ Even with a ghostwriter, this was a mess. It reads like a young girl's journal and extremely lacked the emotional depth and introspection that you typically see in memoirs. The writing was elementary and fragmented and a lot of it felt like she wrote it just to diss to certain people. Don't get me wrong, these people more than deserved the diss, but the point still stands. As someone who said that she gets upset because people are talking behind her back, giving interviews about her without her permission, it's just an interesting approach is all I'm saying.Parts of the story feel missing or only scrape the surface. I don’t feel that readers can gain a sense of who the real Britney is from this.There are certainly takeaways that I got from this book but I'm left with more questions than anything. I would have loved to have seen more backstory about her rise to fame because she hardly spent any time on it at all. Her real-life story is truly remarkable and I admire her courage, strength, and resilience. I’m happy she’s free now but I could have done without this book at this time. Had this been written with more time away from her trauma (and therefore more time for healing), I think it would have felt more powerful for me. Sometimes people want/need a story in the messy middle of trauma though and that's what this book was.",2
926,The Woman in Me,"First of all, FUCK YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE.Second, I loved this book, the only reason it wasn’t five stars for me is because I was hoping for it to be more in depth than it was. It was a very quick read. It felt like it just scratched the surface, but I understand that I am not entitled to all the details of Britney’s life.Sexism in pop culture, mental health, and unfair/unjust conservatorships are the big talking points here and I think this book will bring awareness to these topics and hopefully spark change.I truly hope Britney finds the happiness and peace she deserves.",4
927,The Woman in Me,"At what point did I promise to stay seventeen for the rest of my life?Growing up, I remember being fascinated by Britney Spears. Not only did I love her music—I'm a pop fan through and through—but at a time when I was an awkward teenager, she seemed to have it all: the voice, the confidence, the adulation of millions. Now looking back, I realize it must've all been a façade.Reading Britney's words was so sad and heartbreaking. How is it that this girl had no one in her corner? Every single person she loved and trusted would go on to eventually stab her in the back in the most awful and exploitative ways possible. Let's enumerate, shall we?Her father — Definitely a shoo-in for Most Awful Father of the Year Award. Took her money, committed her to psychiatric wards for no reason, kept her from her kids, gaslighted her, dictated every big and small thing in her life. The list goes on. And this went on for 13 years. What the fuck. How is this legal and why is this guy not in jail?Her mother — Just stood by and watched it all happen. Tried to profit off of her name and fame.Her siblings — Ditto.Ex-husband K-Fed — The ultimate deadbeat. Took her kids from her and prevented her from seeing them. Clearly sought sole custody to squeeze as much child support money from her as possible. And apparently a judge went along with it.Justin Timberlake — Made a big fucking deal out of her cheating on him and breaking his heart. Turns out, he's the serial cheater in their relationship. Also made her have an abortion because he wasn't ready to be a dad. Then went on to break up with her over text, paint her as a harlot, and profit off of her public shaming. Well, can't listen to his music anymore, that's for sure.Over the years, there were things that puzzled me about Britney. But reading what she went through and what these people did to her, it all makes sense. I would've shaved my head too if it was the only way I could show some small amount of autonomy, that I wasn't just a body on display, a cash cow existing solely to make money for my parents.Thirteen years is a long time to lose control of your life. How can she get back the time she lost, to have the relationship she wanted with her kids or the career she imagined? She can't. That's what's so heartbreaking about all this. She can only look ahead and move forward, hopefully without bitterness or regret.The writing style is simple and straightforward. Even though Britney used a ghostwriter, it sounds very much like her real voice. There is a rawness and vulnerability that permeates the pages. Though the book never holds back on revelations, it does feel at times like it's just scratching the surface. Even though she talks about all the horrible things that have happened to her, it still comes across so polite, as if she's holding back, afraid to offend those who have done her wrong.I had trouble getting through the book even though it isn't long. Parts of it were so gut-wrenching and horrible that I had to take frequent breaks. Especially when she talks about how her ex-husband and her family would keep her away from her young babies for weeks at a time, it made my heart hurt so bad for her.This memoir is a long time coming. After enduring so much and keeping her silence, I'm glad Britney finally has a chance to speak out and tell her truth. Everyone has the right to live the life they want, and after everything, I hope she finally finds the peace and happiness she's been searching for for so long.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧",4
928,The Woman in Me,"FUCK HER MOTHER, FUCK HER SISTER, FUCK HER EX HUSBAND KEVIN, FUCK JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, FUCK THE MEDIA AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FUCK HER FATHER!!!",5
929,The Woman in Me,"Where to start with this book? After reading this, I am angry!! I am angry at her pathetic, non-supportive, and controlling family for what they have put Britney through. I am angry at all the loser men that have preyed upon her kindness and naivety. I am angry at the media and paparazzi for exposing her as a mad woman. I am angry that it took years for anyone to finally help her. I am angry that someone this rich and famous can be taken advantage of.This was a fast story to read, but believe me it told enough. I’m so glad that Britney was able to finally tell her side of the story. This story starts off with Britney as a young girl and her upbringing. Right away, I knew her parents weren’t right because she told stories of how her father (Mr. Conservator), was an alcoholic and could never keep a job or pay the bills when she was growing up. Britney’s “wonderful” mother would also take her out drinking when she was only 13 years old. Her mom also had her driving the car around at 13. Oh, and don’t worry- because they were so poor, they got Britney into show business so she could pay the bills. Yay Mom and Dad 👏Even though Britney bought her parents, and that little sister Jamie Lynn Spears everything they could ever want or need- that still wasn’t enough. They wanted total control of Britney. And if anyone is familiar with dysfunctional families and the family scapegoat, it’s quite obvious Britney was and always will be the family scapegoat. No matter how great or famous she is, they will always find something wrong with her no matter what. (Sad to say, but I’ve lived through this family dynamic my whole life as well).When Britney went through the worst times of her life- her breakup with Justin Timberlake, her divorce from Kevin Federline (K-Fed- total douchebag), her meltdowns in and due to the paparazzi. No one was there for her. No. One. All her family did was tell her she was crazy and a disgrace. They watched her every move through a microscope (just like the paparazzi)- so they could put her in a conservatorship for 13 years and control everything about her.While in the conservatorship, her father controlled what she wore, what time she went to bed, her phone was monitored, she was given a measly weekly allowance, and he even controlled what she ate. For two years straight, Britney only ate chicken and vegetables from a can. And through this time her dad continuously told her she was fat! Ughhhh!!I could really go on much longer, but I would spoil the whole book. I didn’t go into too much detail about my thoughts on Justin Timberlake (okay, I did previously mention that he was a weird looking little weasel), and K-Fed 🤮. During the writing of this book she was still married to Hesam (Sam) Asghari, and still very much in love. But we all know, Britney and Sam have since divorced.I hope Britney gets to be the woman she wants to be, and to live the life she deserves moving forward. I pray that she stays far away from her toxic, evil, manipulative family. I pray that she has a loving relationship with her sons, and hopefully her family and K-Fed haven’t gaslighted and brainwashed them against their mother too bad. I hope her sons read this book, and build a relationship with Britney. I also hope Britney stays single for a while to heal and find herself…In case you haven’t noticed- yes, I highly recommend this book!! I also hope Britney gets a ton of money from this book and laughs all the way to the bank while her family sits and rots!",5

931,The Woman in Me,"**Winner of the 2023 Goodreads Choice Award for Memoir**As much as society loves to build up an idol they love to watch one fall and burn. This is especially true when the celebrity icon is a woman and one that can become a symbol of castigation such as the case of Britney Spears. Having been molded into an icon that was both highly sexualized yet also virginal and youthful, Spears skyrocketed to stardom and made many rich folks far richer but then that same celebrity image was turned into a weapon against her. But who is Spears behind the image that was created of her? ‘It’s time for me not to be someone who other people want,’ she writes inThe Woman in Me, her new memoir, ‘it’s time to actually find myself.’ While it reads like a slow burn horror of a woman exploited, shamed and imprisoned by those closest to her, Spears never comes across as angry and the book feels less like a tell-all than it does a search for who she that is asking the same question her fans have been asking while pouring over her Instagram for clues: is she okay? This book is also an tragic example in the long history of how fragile women's rights over financial and bodily control are and that mental health has long been used against them as a way to remove those rights. A quick read that seems to fly through events at the same pace that her career seemed to be moving, it is hard to not feel compassion and sadness for Spears as she finds her voice and gives us insight into her mind during the whirlwind of a life that practically made as many headlines as the number of records she sold. ‘I wanted to hide, but I also wanted to be seen,’ she says, ‘both things could be true,’ and here we can finally see Spears on her terms as she deserves to be seen.‘Music stopped the noise, made me feel confident, and took me to a pure place of expressing myself exactly as I wanted to be seen and heard.’Britney Spears was everywhere when I was growing up, she was impossible to not know and even if you didn’twantto know you couldn’t escape the media’s narrative of her rise and unraveling. I was the right age where I could pretend I didn’t love her music and that I only knew every lyric to every song because my younger sister was a huge fan, but lets face it: Britney was an icon, her music was catchy, she WAS pop culture. There’s no way I’m not reading her memoir, I’m too invested in this story simply from being alive and into music when I was. It’s lovely to know she has beenfreed from her conservatorship, where her own father and lawyers took complete control over her for 13 years, but the whole story seems a large metaphor for what celebrity means in capitalism: you are lessyouand more a product to be controlled by corporate lawyers and marketing execs (remember when John Foggertylost a lawsuit suing him over plagiarising the sounds of John Foggerty, since his voice and style were technically owned by a record company?). While this book leaves a long list of names to be angry and appalled at, Spears never comes across as angry. More sad, almost apologetic, and merely telling what happened. In fact so much of this feels dispassionate, as if she is tired beyond the capacity for rightful rage. But also it seems a lesson long beaten into her that women don’t get to be angry, that anything other than passive acceptance makes her a villain. Which is truly tragic and so much of this book reminds us of the long history of misogyny, of policing women’s bodies, words, tone, actions, and any other aspect of their lives. And how, because of this, women are shamed into feeling they deserve the abuse, as Spears shows when she writes 'the sadness and the loneliness that would hit me felt like my fault somehow, like I deserved unhappiness and bad luck.' Which is just so heartbreaking.‘Why did my managers work so hard to claim I was some kind of young-girl virgin even into my twenties?’Much has been written about the way Spears image was to take a young, virginal image of a girl and sexualize her for the sake of men’s lusts. She has often been discussed in comparison with Dolores Haze from Nabokov’sLolitafor the sexualization of a teenage girl (such as the music video with Spears in a risque school girl outfit dancing in the halls of a high school, though Spears admits here that the outfit was her idea). In herarticleon the recent documentary series,Framing Britney Spears, Grace O’Neil writes that ‘Britney is Dolores and we—the public who voraciously consumed her—are a pack of Humberts,’ and that her image was a “safe” way for men to satisfy a taboo lust. Though Tavi Gevinson, in anarticle you should definitely readas it is not just about Spears but power dynamics in general, points out that the documentary is ‘eager to characterize Spears’s early image as an expression of female power rather than the corporation-sanctioned sexualization of a 16-year-old’ Which is a key thing, it was an image created to give the feeling that she was in control and sexually liberated, but as we all saw, it was also the way she was demonized and we should ‘engage the messier implications of the virginal-but-sexy archetype:Here is a girl who can perform sex for an audience’s benefit, but who, thank God, has not yet been tainted by experience.America’s response to Spears was puritanical, but so was the fantasy her image fulfilled.’ We also see in this book how breaking from the 'fantasy' is a reason to condemn her, but also remove her agency. It should be noted that the ""hysteria"" was a mental disorder that was attributed to women (until 1980), and was often used as a way to strip women of their rights and autonomy. Being labeled as ""crazy"" did just this to Spears.Spears shows how so much of her life was controlled by a very calculated misogyny, such as theRolling Stonesphotoshoot with David LaChapelle that captilazied on the sexualization of a teenage girl. As Gevinson argues that Spears was never in control, and this was also calculated in order to allow people to turn a blind eye from the ways she was abused.‘There is no need to believe it’s eitherEverything was Britney’s choice, and therefore she was always a sex-positive feminist or Nothing was Britney’s choice, and the evil adults made all her decisions.Both assertions sound desperate to protect her respectability — another version of her purity, in fact — as a prerequisite for compassion. They remind me of how readily conversations about abuse and assault focus on the moral character of the victim in order to confirm that they have indeed been victimized.’The first half of Spears book very quickly takes us through her career, though it is less an autopsy of her stardom and more a litany of harms. If this were a film we would cut directly from her telling Ed McMahon on Star Search at age 10 that she doesn’t have a boyfriend because ‘boys are mean’ to a montage of the her relationships with Justin Timeberlake and Kevin Federline. ‘Looking back, I think that both Justin and Kevin were very clever. They knew what they were doing, and I played right into it,” she writes, and shows how her desire to be loved became an opening to be exploited (OKAY but the moment she got to Timberlake being all ‘let me play you some soothing guitar’ as shes crying on the floor from the pain of her abortion she was very much pressured into having--not great JT). We also see how she was just access to fame for Federline and that he had no interest in being a father. And it all ends poorly for Spears, especially once the conservatorship begins. And if there is anyone to truly be mad at, it is her parents and management that failed to protect her and instead capitalized on all the drama.‘I was so beaten down by all of it that I just surrendered.’All these events happened at a time of really heightened celebrity in the US spurred by channels like MTV that shifted the focus away from the actual music and into a celebration of privileged lifestyles. While shows like Jackass turned men with massive drug, alcohol and mental health problems into household names to laugh WITH while celebrity women became icons to laugh AT (and shamed for alcohol, drugs, sex or mental health struggles). Everyone seemed way too eager to see Spears have a public breakdown, everyone was excited for cameras to capture the next Lindsey Lohan binge, everyone enjoyed calling Paris Hilton dumb a bit too much to consider it harmless fun. Being joyful at someone’s supposed shortcomings is never cool but it became a commodity, and much of this seemed to be orchestrated to mock women who rose to stardom almost as some gross patriarchal lesson. It happens all the time but it was practically the focus of US entertainment aimed at youth culture. And it’s because the industry saw them all as products not people.That’s why reading this felt like a damning indictment against the way patriarchal societies objectify, commoditize, consume and control women. Britney was caged into a message to young women to be commoditized, to be docile and nice, to be exploited and happy for it or be punished. In her bookEntitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women, Dr.Kate Mannelays out the various ways men feel entitled to women’s bodies, labor, affection, etc. and this book practically goes through each of her points to check the boxes. On women’s bodies, for example:‘It was always incredible to me that so many people felt so comfortable talking about my body. It had started when I was young. Whether it was strangers in the media or within my own family, people seemed to experience my body as public property: something they could police, control, criticize, or use as a weapon. My body was strong enough to carry two children and agile enough to execute every choreographed move perfectly onstage. And now here I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body.’There is a similar message inEmily Ratajkowski’s memoirMy Body. Sure, people will say that is the price of fame, but that isnot okayand is just a way to hold an umbrella for abuse. Hop on social media right now and you’ll see plenty of people shaming Britney for this book and especially for having aborted the baby without acknowledging the emotional pressures put on her to do so or the way her whole life she was coached to not have any agency. She talks about how she notices the questions Timberlake was asked in interviews were very different than the type she got, which often asked about her body. It also plays into Dr. Manne’s idea onhimpathy—that is the way people tend to sympathize with a man over a woman even when he is the abuser and demand she prove she isn’t somehow complicit in her own abuse—which we see in the way society rallied around Justin and hisCry Me A Riversong and began to look at Spears as a heartless heartbreaker when in realityI was shattered…I don’t think Justin realised the power he had in shaming me. I don’t think he understands to this day.’ And when things started to come apart, she was labeled as crazy and deserving of scorn instead of recognizing the mental health issues ‘because I now know that I was displaying just about every symptom of perinatal depression: sadness, anxiety, fatigue.’What did anyone expect when she was treated as unable to take care of herself and like a perpetual 17 year old sex icon her whole life. ‘I’d begin to think in some ways like a child,’ she admits. But it was also a rage against the world.‘Shaving my head was a way of saying to the world: Fuck you. You want me to be pretty for you? Fuck you. You want me to be good for you? Fuck you. You want me to be your dream girl? Fuck you. I’d been the good girl for years.’This book very well explores the way she was built into this image and then silenced for breaking it. And the latter half about the 13 years under the conservatorship are horrifying. ‘For thirteen years, I wasn't allowed to eat what I wanted, to drive, to spend my money how I wanted, to drink alcohol or even coffee,’ she says, but now she has ‘freedom to do what I want to do has given me back my womanhood. In my forties, I'm trying things for what feels like the first time. I feel like the woman in me was pushed down for so long.’ I’m glad to see she is able to feel she has a voice and search for what freedom means for her, but also for who she is. This is a quick read, a sad one too, but it is nice to hear her side and remember how harsh society is on women. Especially the ones they prop up for profit and then profit off of watching them burn down. I hope for nothing but the best and inner peace for Spears.⅘‘I've started to experience the riches of being an adult woman for the first time in many years. I feel like I've been underwater for so long, only rarely swimming up to the surface to gasp for air and a little food. When I regained my freedom, that was my cue to step out onto dry land and, any time I want, to take vacations, sip a cocktail, drive my car, go to a resort, or stare out at the ocean.’",4
932,The Woman in Me,"I was a huge spears friend when I was a teenager, even trying to learn her dance in one more time (spoiler alert: I made my parents laugh). I’ve loved a lot of her work, but I stopped buying spears products or styling my hair like she did. I’ve knew some of what happened to her later in life, but not the extent of her imprisonment. I found that part really heartbreaking and shocking.What I didn’t like was the writing style. Her life was described like ticking off her experiences from a list, and it lacked the emotional depth I would have preferred.Also I found it a bit ironic how she felt disappointed about people talking about her ‘behind her back’ and not contacting her before they did, when she does the same things, for example with Justin and their relationship. She might have reached out and asked people she talked badly about to get their feedback. I don’t like when famous people share information that might be negative for the people she writes about. Now I don’t know her reasons for writing about it, she might just not have thought that it would hurt anybody, so I give her the benefit of the doubt.All in all it gave you what you needed to know about her, but some parts of it felt off and disappointed me somewhat.",3
933,The Woman in Me,"It’s hard to rate a heartfelt memoir that is basically a long-repressed confession and an attempt to come to grasp what the hell actually happened to life. You can’t help but feel that in judging the book you’re judging the person behind it, the person who just poured her soul out in a very vulnerable and a bit messy way.So, instead of judging I’d rather give a big warm hug and a reassurance that yes, Britney, I think you’ve finally been seen how you want to be seen.“Thirteen years went by with me feeling like a shadow of myself. I think back now on my father and his associates having control over my body and my money for that long and it makes me feel sick.Think of how many male artists gambled all their money away; how many had substance abuse or mental health issues. No one tried to take away their control over their body and money. I didn’t deserve what my family did to me.”I remember that in my adolescence and young adulthood Britney Spears seemed to be everywhere - or at least everywhere where the attention of a teenage girl went, ever since “…Baby One More Time” catchy lyrics and equally catchy video made me stare at the TV in my living room in fascination when I was 15. TV, glossy magazines, radio — and not just the music but relentless gossip, scrutiny, speculations, gleeful schadenfreude whenever there was any real or perceived blunder, and vitriolic mocking delight when something went wrong with the Princess of Pop.We love to build them up but we equally love to tear them down, I suppose.“That’s the thing about this industry. I never knew how to play the game. I didn’t know how to present myself on any level. […] I can see now that you have to be smart enough, vicious enough, deliberate enough to play the game, and I did not know the game. I was truly innocent—just clueless. […]So I was young, and I made a lot of mistakes. But I will say this: I wasn’t manipulative. I was just stupid.”Here, however, Britney Spears, having lived through 13 years of absolutely ridiculous conservatorship (when she was well enough to earn millions but legally not well enough to spend them, or do most things an adult independent woman would take for granted - like determine her contraception or use her phone when she wanted to, or choose to say “no”) shows what was going on behind the glitz and sparkles and occasional denim-on-denim outfit. What comes through in a still very young-sounding voice is a sensitive person who’s conditioned to be sweet and nice, and often a bit confused, and quite lonely, who spent a long time learning how to be intimidated and even be angry politely, and strangely over-reliant on her family even as an adult despite emotional abuse — and whose natural development seems to be artificially stunted somewhat by the unnatural cage she ended up in — in a true medieval fashion made to be a property of her father.“The woman in me was pushed down for a long time. They wanted me to be wild onstage, the way they told me to be, and to be a robot the rest of the time. I felt like I was being deprived of those good secrets of life—those fundamental supposed sins of indulgence and adventure that make us human. They wanted to take away that specialness and keep everything as rote as possible. It was death to my creativity as an artist.”She’s not going to win any writing awards any time soon, but that’s not the point of her story. Where she succeeds is at the emotional level, just so plainly wanting to be heard and give us *her* view of her own story. What you’re left with is the admiration that she wasn’t fully broken, that she is out free to live her life and make her choices, and choose to be carefree and reckless if she wants, or just enjoy the quiet peace if she so chooses. But she can choose it for herself, without ending up someone else’s property.Maybe she’ll make choices others disagree with or judge, but she has the freedom to make them — the freedom that should have never been taken away from her in the first place.“I’d been taught through the conservatorship to feel almost too fragile, too scared. That’s the price I paid under the conservatorship. They took a lot of my womanhood, my sword, my core, my voice, the ability to say “Fuck you.” And I know that sounds bad, but there is something crucial about this. Don’t underestimate your power.”And it’s still so polite, this book. Still reserved and sweet at the times where I’d expect anyone to start screaming in bloody rage at the world. And I’m not sure if that’s just a careful editorial decision or Britney’s personality, but in any way it’s striking. And perhaps says more by its restraint than it would have done otherwise. Because her conservatorship was mindlessly cruel and ridiculous, and I am horrified at the thought that others may be in the same situation but without Britney’s means to get out, broken without much hope.“I sometimes thought that it was almost funny how I won those awards for the album I made while I was supposedly so incapacitated that I had to be controlled by my family.The truth was, though, when I stopped to think about it for very long, it wasn’t funny at all.”4 stars and a hug. I’m judging it on its own separate scale since it managed to hit me right in the feels.“Shaving my head was a way of saying to the world: Fuck you. You want me to be pretty for you? Fuck you. You want me to be good for you? Fuck you. You want me to be your dream girl? Fuck you. I’d been the good girl for years. I’d smiled politely while TV show hosts leered at my breasts, while American parents said I was destroying their children by wearing a crop top, while executives patted my hand condescendingly and second-guessed my career choices even though I’d sold millions of records, while my family acted like I was evil. And I was tired of it.”——————Also posted onmy blog.",4
934,The Woman in Me,"“My father shoved aside my bowl of receipts, setting up his things on the bar. “I just want to let you know,” he said, “I call the shots. You sit right there in that chair and I’ll tell you what goes on.”I looked at him with a growing sense of horror.“I’m Britney Spears now,” he said.”pg. 182Britney Spears, The Princess of Pop, is arguably one of the most mistreated people in Hollywood, and especially after the events in the past few years, I was highly anticipating this memoir.It was equal parts happy, because Britney isfinallyable to share, in her own words, what she went through the past 15 years, and equal parts horrific because the abuse she experienced isn't something anyone should be put through.“The saddest part to me was that what I always wanted was a dad who would love me as I was—somebody who would say, “I just love you. You could do anything right now. I’d still love you with unconditional love.”pg. 23Although The Woman in Me does not explain everything, it gives context to a lot of the situations that the media focused on throughout the 2000s, including her relationship with Justin Timberlake, the shaved head/hitting a paparazzi car with an umbrella incident (which I don't think anyone willeverforget), and her marriage to Kevin Federline. Most importantly, she discussed her experience with the conservatorship, which as we know was perpetrated by her dad, Jamie Spears, for 13 years! It was heartbreaking to read about the enablers of the conservatorship, including her mom, Lynne Spears, and how much everyone, including the court system, misled and took advantage of her during these years. She is so brave for making the final 911 call which ultimately led to the end of the conservatorship.Wendy Williams said it best...“Why was it so easy for everyone to forget that I was a human being—vulnerable enough that these headlines could leave a bruise?”pg. 100The memoir felt more authentic than I anticipated, even though she worked with ghostwriters (like most celebrities do when writing memoirs), which pleasantly surprised me! I personally have fallen down the rabbit hole of Britney Spears conspiracy theories multiple times in the past few years, and I am not sure if this memoir convinced me that she is 100% safe. I was hoping she would talk about her marriage with Hesam Asghari, and their ""wedding"" (If you know, you know. If you don't, look it up on TikTok LOL), but from the sections where he is mentioned, it seems like she wrote this when they were still together.Overall, it was a really enjoyable read, I would recommend it not only to fans of Britney Spears and celebrity memoirs but to anyone looking to pick up a quick read because Britney deserves for her truth to be heard.#FreeBritney",4
935,The Woman in Me,"Insights Behind the HeadlinesKudos to Britney Spears for speaking publicly about her conservatorship!This is the second book this year where I have read about guardians gone wrong. In Astor: The Rise and Fall of an American Fortune by Anderson Cooper, Brooke Astor had a very difficult time in her later years. Her son, Tony Marshall, was accused of allowing her to live in squalor and reduced necessary medications.Luckily, Ms. Astor (who was worth an estimated $192 million upon her death) had some friends in very high places. Her grandsons teamed up with Annette de la Renta, billionaire David Rockefeller, and Henry Kissinger. The very next day after filing the affidavits, the judge signed guardianship over to Annette de la Renta and JP Morgan Chase guardian over her assets.Why in the world was Britney’s father put in charge of her assets? How in the world is he qualified? JP Morgan Chase or an alcoholic with a history of bankruptcy?The Woman In Me is an interesting behind-the-scenes view of the major events of Britney’s life, primarily focusing on Britney’s conservatorship.Although the book is riveting, the book felt a bit high-level, and it felt like some things were missing.For example, Britney is locked up in a rehab facility for months at a time against her will. Presumably, Britney was dating Sam Asghari at this point.Personally, I trust approximately four people in my life, but these four people would do literally anything to help me. If I was Britney, I would be desperately trying to get in contact with Sam Asghari. However, she never talks about whether she attempted to reach Sam during her time in confinement.It seems to me that Britney Spears is one of the loneliest people in the world. Any time she meets anyone, she must think, “Does this person like me because they like me or is this person trying to be nice to me for money?” Her family should have been the one group of people that she could rely on, but even they turned on her. How could she feel safe and secure with the years of constantly traveling to perform and with her father’s mean comments?Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",5
936,The Woman in Me,"I was in high school when Britney shaved her head. There were sixty kids in my small-town graduating class. We were all ""celebrities"" in our own way. We gossiped about each other, spread rumors, knew every intimate detail. I still remember who lost their virginity to who, at least according to legend. Now I realize half the stuff we said about each other couldn't possibly be true. But rumors, especially the salacious ones, stick around.I'd always loved Britney's music, but it was her tabloid scandal era when I connected to her personally. Maybe because I had my own weekly barrage of lies to fend off. Mostly the other kids said I was a faggot. That didn't bother me because it was true. When I didn't cry, my tormentors invented new things to say. The most widespread rumor was that I had sex with poodles and was furthermore riddled with venereal diseases from them. This was so ridiculous it was easy to laugh off. I never expected anyone would actually believe it, but some did. Years later I learned a small number of classmates—grown-ass adults now—stillthought this about me.A lot has been said about Britney Spears. Intuitively, most of us realize the rumors must be far from the truth. Likely that’s why her book is such a bestseller. What is the real story behind the iconic photographs, front-page break-ups and altered stage presence? What's the deal with her family?This book doesn't answer every question, but it does provide context for major events that even non-fans will remember: What (if anything) did Britney do to Justin? Why did she shave her head and attack paparazzi with an umbrella? What was going through her mind during the infamous ""Gimme More"" VMA performance? Why did she cancel her successful Vegas residency?Britney’s explanations range from in-depth to predictably vague. At times she seems to be a revisionist, such as when she explains that the “Gimme More” music video appears low-budget because it was casually filmed with friends while they popped in and out of bars. In actuality, the video was directed by Jake Sarfaty and shot in a warehouse—or at least that was previously considered a fact. Either way, she shouldn’t apologize. It’s a great video.I do think trauma perhaps misconstrued some of her memories. Like when she writes she didn’t mind Justin bragging about banging her, because it allowed her to “come out” as a non-virgin. It’s hard for me to imagine her being totally okay with what he said. My basis for thinking this is from personal experience.Previously I wrote that I didn’t mind being called homophobic slurs and could “laugh off” repulsive rumors. Almost certainly that’s not true. I’m sure I was destroyed, but over time my mind has altered these memories for my own benefit. Reliving trauma can be as deadly as heart disease. To fix this, the mind might reshape memories to mend the injury, like putting a scab over a wound. I’m not a doctor, but that’s how it feels to me.Of course not all wounds are easy to heal. Britney’s memoirs grow particularly dark when she gets into the conservatorship. This section receives the most pages and feels like the part she wrote on her own, with the least help from editors and ghostwriters. It’s heartbreaking to read, even after being familiar with her legal testimony.You don’t have to be a global superstar to learn from Britney that family can be dangerous. The people who are supposed to love you unconditionally are also the ones who can be the most evil, the most controlling, and the worst for mental health. And it’s always so obvious to outsiders. Of course Britney’s family only care about the money. It’s even tempting to blame Britney herself for staying in that situation as long as she did.But when it’s you—your family who’s gaslighting and manipulating—you put up with the abuse. You don’t even see it. You wait for them to change—because of the happy memories, or out of blind devotion. Because That’s What Family Is For, or some bullshit.I say ‘you’ but I really mean me. No, I don’t have money, so my family isn’t interested in that, but they are obsessed with changing me—trying to mold me into whatever straight religious Frankenstein monster of a creation they have in mind. In the animal kingdom, it seems cruel when mama birds push their babies out of the nest. Now I wonder if that’s a major evolutionary advantage. At a certain point, parents turn rancid. It’s best to fly away as fast as you can.Overall, this book was emotional, a little triggering, and perhaps unnecessary. I will always love Britney because her music and personal strength got me through my own tough times, but I also understand that she is a product of pop culture and we may never truly understand what it’s like to be her.In the copyright section, there is this puzzling note: ""The right of Britney Jean Spears to be identified as the author of this work has been asserted in accordance with the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988.” This is not the kind of note that assures readers Britney herself was the sole author of this book. That’s not to say another writer can’t articulate her feelings, and I’m sure she signed off on everything, but this is far from the “tell-all” big reveal fans, psychologists and pop culture fanatics have been dreaming of.Of course it’s hard to tell all when you’re still processing years of abuse. Also, things change. The book must have been finalized some months back, since it ends on the pleasant note of implied martial success with Sam Asghari. They officially divorced back in August.I think the rosy Sam sections were probably what Britney had in mind when she thought it would be “too hard” to read the audiobook herself. Fortunately Michelle Williams put in a stellar performance that not only breathes life into the text, but mimics Britney’s tonal quality so that it’s easy to imagine it’s her.WhileThe Woman in Medoesn’t always live up to the hype, it is still a must-read case study of American stardom and the dangers of relationships that anyone can find themselves in, to one degree or another.",5

939,The Woman in Me,"Moved to tears.Poor Britney! Her highly anticipated memoir expertly read by actress Michelle Williams provides her fans with an insight into her sheltered world. Britney details her desire to make it big so she can escape poverty and an abusive household. As the daughter of a controlling alcoholic father, she longed for fame and fortune. Once she made it big, her family took advantage of her generosity instead of recognizing her loneliness, depression, and sadness.After her infamous violent outburst where she shaved her head and attacked paparazzi, her father placed her in a conservatorship for thirteen years. During this time, all aspects of her life were strictly dictated by him, while he reaped the profits. The book highlights how she was brutally exploited for thirteen years and her consequent struggle to gain autonomy.Britney does spill a few secrets, but the main takeaway from this book is that fame comes with a price and if you see something, say something.While I found myself sobbing over the sad story of such a beloved superstar, I question why she does not mention being diagnosed with a mental illness as it has been widely reported. Is this true? Is she hiding more secrets? Probably.Regardless, the book is well-written, contains emotional depth, and the audiobook is superb. Chef’s kiss to Michelle Williams!Congratulations to Britney for all her achievements in the music industry as well as in her personal life. She truly is a superstar for being brave enough to share her story with the world.I am forever your fan!5/5 stars",5

941,The Woman in Me,"4 StarsTo be clear, this rating is not a review or judgment of Britney’s life, struggles, or journey. It’s just a reflection on how much I enjoyed the book as a reading experience.I am almost the same exact age as Britney, so I feel like we grew up together. I was very much a fan of her, NSYNC, Christina Aguilera, Backstreet...basically ALL the chart topping pop performers and bands of that time and genre (among others too, mind you). I remember having so much teenage envy for her life and her romance with Justin Timberlake.Obviously we all watched from the outside as her life has unfolded since that time, whatever our perceptions.This book reminded me that fame and fortune are not all they are cracked up to be. Britney has been treated like a cash register show pony for so many years of her life. Like a commodity of the world. The way she was targeted and treated by the media was virtually criminal.Shame on the paparazzi.Shame on people like Diane Sawyer.Shame on all of us for creating the demand that prompted this treatment of another human being.Who knows what the truth of anything really is...but this book is Britney's perception of her life and the ways things played out. And based on this book and just watching her story in the media for many years, it definitely seems like Britney has never (or at least not for many years) really had anyone in her life who wasn't there for ulterior motives. And that makes me sad for her.I'm really happy she finally got to tell her story. I hope she finds happiness.",4
942,The Woman in Me,"3 ""thank you for the music and fun and clean house"" stars !!!Dear Britney....As somebody who has distantly followed you for many years I knew very little about your life.You see I so enjoyed listening to your pop bubblegum and dance grooves that I wanted to keep it to the music.I saw how upset and irate you could become, heard distantly about family dysfunction and heartbreak as well as struggles with both substances and mental health.I continued to dance. Your pretty brown eyes and routines brought me the simplest of joys. I heard you at the clubs and saw four of your concert shows and loved them all. The simple southern girl next door that loved McDonalds.Whenever my home was in disarray...I would put on Britney (yes you Britney) and Madonna and Robyn and Rihanna too and in no time you ladies would whip my ass in shape and my house would be spic and span.Thank you for sharing your experiences and perspectives with all of us.I wish in my heart for you to-continue on your journey of healing and get the assistance you need and deserve-only have supportive and kind people in your life-love and cherish your sons and whoever is in your chosen family-find a great love-continue to commune with God-when you can- put out a new album or two so that I can continue to dance, laugh and clean with you plus I would love to share the biggest poutine on earth with you and giggle like crazyBiggest hugs and well wishesJaidee",3
943,The Woman in Me,"Don’t miss my article on medium.com :https://medium.com/@niluferyozmekik/t...What did I feel after reading the last words of this memoir? I felt the importance of liberating your potential by truly discovering who you are! But I'm also truly angered by how cruel and manipulative a family can be to exploit the talents of a woman, trying to steal her money, her possessions, her freedom, and finally her soul—demanding a piece of her in the worst way than paparazzi did to earn their wage. This is a stunning, highly thought-provoking must-read and the most alluring, argumentative memoir of the year! The winner is ""It's Britney, bitch.""“In the Bible, it says your tongue is your sword. My tongue and my sword were me singing. My whole childhood, I sang. I sang along with the car radio on the way to dance class. I sang when I was sad. To me, singing was spiritual.”That book made me ache, cry, scream in frustration, awe, resent, piss off, smile, and finally filled with empathy for a unique, unusual, eccentric talented woman who has been randomly bullied by the media. She was shunned, shamed, and criticized by people who have no idea about her life. She experienced slut and body shaming when she was only a teenager, asked if her breasts were real instead of acknowledging the musical achievements she succeeded in at a young age.“Artists make things and play characters because they want an escape into faraway worlds, and escape was exactly what I needed. I wanted to live inside my dreams, my wonderful fictitious world, and never think about reality if I could help it. Singing bridged reality and fantasy, the world I was living in and the world that I desperately wanted to inhabit.”She is coming from a very dysfunctional family which the people who never learn the meaning of love and respect in contrast showing their feelings in abuse and most distorted ways of dysfunctionality.“…my grandfather June Spears Sr.-was abusive. Jean suffered the loss of a baby when he was only three days old. June sent Jean to Southeast Louisiana Hospital, a by-all-accounts horrible asylum in Mandeville, where she was put on lithium. In 1966, when she was thirty-one, my grandmother Jean shot herself with a shotgun on her infant son's grave, just over eight years after his death. I can't imagine the grief that she must have felt.”She worked so hard to pursue her dreams without knowing the meaning of misogyny, mansplaining in big boys’ world without having a tactic to play the right game. She just wanted to perform and shine!“I signed my name with a heart. I liked looking cute. Why did everyone treat me, even when I was a teenager, like I was dangerous?”This was in contrast to her opposite-sex peers who became rising stars from the Mickey Mouse Club, gaslighting the fans with crocodile tears they shed after a wrongly reflected breakup story.“Abortion was something I never could have imagined choosing for myself, but given the circumstances, that is what we didI don't know if that was the right decision. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn't want to be a father“…. When I tell you it was painful-I can't begin to describe it. The pain was unbelievable. I went down to the ground on my knees, holding the toilet. For a long time, I couldn't move. To this day, it's one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life.”Britney is a dancer, singer, performer, mother, depressed, troubled, manipulated, captivated, institutionalized, but still, she’s a woman, a crying soul who wants to please the people she loves, and her only intention is to be loved in return.This book tells the heart-wrenching story of a little Louisiana girl who loved white marbles, felt protected by her faith in God, loved the spotlight, used her dancing and singing skills to shine bright, and turned into a young woman burdened with responsibilities at a young age.She never experienced a proper childhood with a drunk father and an argumentative mother who granted her enough freedom to drive a car at the age of thirteen. Even though she was underage, she purchased them a house, an act that displayed financial responsibility beyond her years. However, her family later chose to strip away her rights, coercing her into obedience—a child who had generated enough wealth to turn them into multimillionaires. This is the story of a girl who never had the chance to explore becoming a real woman, manipulated not only by her own family but also by the men in her life: a first love who compelled her to undergo an abortion in their shared house, leaving her bleeding on the bathroom floor, and a husband who was enamored with the seductive allure of fame and power, ultimately taking custody of their two children and betraying her trust in the most egregious ways.For years, she was marketed as the girl next door, the young virgin, the teenage beauty, subjecting her to immense pressure and resulting in psychotic breaks, compounded by additional postpartum depression.“With my head shaved, everyone was scared of me, even my mom. No one would talk to me anymore because I was too ugly.My long hair was a big part of what people liked -I knew that. I knew a lot of guys thought long hair was hot.Shaving my head was a way of saying to the world: Fuck you. You want me to be pretty for you? Fuck you. You want me to be good for you? Fuck you. You want me to be your dream girl? Fuck you.”For years, from her Instagram videos to her creepy, awkward fashion style choices, or, let me say, most naked choreographies she performed on social media, adding blades to her dance, which alarmed most of us, made me roll my eyes and say to myself: what the heck is this woman trying to do. But when I read this book, I truly understood and empathized with the main reason for her peculiar behavior.She’s performing whatever she likes because, after thirteen years of family prison—conservatorship—that put her life on pause to live for others, she has every right to be unleashed and liberate herself in whatever condition she chooses.“From all those years making myself do what I was told and being treated in a certain way, I've come to see what kind of people I want to be around and what kind of people I don't. So much of the media was cruel to me, and that hasn't changed just because I am out of the conservatorship. There's been a lot of speculation about how I'm doing. I know my fans care. I am free now. I'm just being myself and trying to heal. I finally get to do what I want, when I want. And I don't take a minute of it for granted.”She earned it. You may find it weird, unusual, but this is how she expresses herself. Thankfully, things started to change, and mental health awareness became a more crucial element in our lives, even though the increasing amount of cyberbullying, slut-body shaming still haunts people's lives on social media.When we read the life story of Britney written in a genuine tone, we learn to understand that for years, most of us have not been fair with our judgments about her.Freedom means being goofy, silly, and having fun on social media. Freedom means taking a break from Instagram without people calling 911. Freedom means being able to make mistakes, and learning from them. Freedom means I don't have to perform for anyone-onstage or offstage. Freedom means that I get to be as beautifully imperfect as everyone else. And freedom means the ability, and the right, to search for joy, in my own way, on my own terms.She’s been framed, turned into a slave, and for years nobody extended a hand to take her out of her dark corner. That’s the most painful part of her story. When she couldn’t find enough love and support from her own family, including her mother and her sister—who already wrote their own biographies before her to emphasize how hard it is to live a life with her, even though she already left them behind and they still accommodate to the houses she’s bought for them—she decided to trust her fans’ devotion and the God who gave her patience to get through this compelling process.“It took a long time and a lot of work for me to feel ready to tell my story. I hope it inspires people on some level and can touch hearts. Since I've been free, I've had to construct a whole different identity. I've had to say, wait a second, this is who I was-someone passive and pleasing. A girl. And this is who I am now-someone strong and confident. A woman.”“Woman in Me” unveils not only the struggles of an iconic pop star but also the broader societal issues surrounding mental health, autonomy, and the exploitation of celebrities. Britney Spears' journey, as narrated in this memoir, serves as a stark reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding beyond the glitz and glamour of fame.As we close the chapters of this gripping memoir, it prompts us to reflect on the collective responsibility we hold as a society to protect and uplift those who entertain us, rather than succumb to the allure of sensationalism and tabloid narratives. The resilience and determination Britney exhibited in breaking free from the chains of conservatorship inspire us to advocate for justice, compassion, and the basic human right to live one's life on one's terms.A note: If there were Oscars for the best book narration category, Michelle Williams would undoubtedly receive high accolades for her extraordinary talent. She lent her voice to Britney's traumatic yet compelling, and ultimately inspirational and empowering life story. Williams adeptly conveyed the restrained emotions simmering beneath the surface, demonstrating both sensitivity and balanced objectivism. This approach allowed listeners to connect deeply with Britney and her unique life journey.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",4

946,The Woman in Me,"5/5Ironiškai šyptelėjot, pamatę šią knygą ir mano įvertinimą? Tikriausiai jum reikia ją perskaityti. Kada nors juokėtės iš Britnės, nufotkintos paparacų, besiskutančios galvą, verkiančios su vaiku ant kelių? Pagalvojot, kad per stora? Per durna? Kekšė? Tikriausiai jum reikia ją perskaityti. Su Britne augot? Daug ką jau ir taip žinosit. Ir nenustebins literatūrine išmone, bet ar žadėjo? Gal Britne nepatikėsit, bet mano pirmasis instinktas – visada tikėti auka. Kol neįrodyta kitaip. Ypač, kai kalba moteris. Ypač, kai ilgai tylėjo. Ypač, kai matėme milijardierę savo tėvo kalinę, negalinčią spręsti nei ką valgyti, nei kiek laiko leisti su savo vaikais, priverstą dirbti, įrašinėti ir nuolat žeminamą, negaunančią savo pačios uždirbtų pinigų, bet labai ilgai nieko nedarėme. Ar bus vietų, kurios kels šypseną skeptiškesniam skaitytojui? Žinoma. Bet pavadinimas – raktas. Joje yra moteris, bet kai tiek metų su tavimi elgiasi kaip su vaiku, o dar ir ypač kvailu, kurį nevengia ir paspirti, ir nuolat pažeminti, imi elgtis kaip vaikas.Eilinis įrodymas, kad kai vyrams leidžiama viskas, daug pasiekusioms moterims reikia dantimis išsiplėšti pagarbą. Ypač jei mėgsta elgtis ir rengtis mergaitiškai. Jei kuria pop muziką. Jei yra blondinės. Augau laikais, kada iš Britnės juoktis buvo bene gero tono ženklas. Ar laikai pasikeitė? Ar jai užgrojus per radiją neapsimetat, kad žodžius žinot truputį ironiškai? Pamenu, kad net mane, tuo metu gal septynerių, Britnę mylinčią iki skausmo, pašiepė kas netingėjo. Nemanau, kad dabar, kai man 27, kas nors labai pasikeitė. Ir man nereikėjo stengtis, kad jos istorijomis patikėčiau. Vietomis pasakojamomis naivokai, bet visada šviesiai, su humoru, aiškiai suvokiant save ir aplinkinius. Skaitydama mačiau moterį, su kuria labai daug metų buvo elgiamasi neatleistinai. Ir ji vis tiek randa gerą žodį bene kiekvienam. Nesuvedinėja sąskaitų – tikrai ne taip, kaip galėtų. Nenešioja pletkų. Teisina skriaudėjus, kaip aukoms ir būdinga. Ir po tiek metų, kai su ja elgėsi kaip su vaiku, bando savyje rasti moterį.",5
947,The Woman in Me,"I read this because of the conservatorship but also enjoyed reading more about her and her life and how she came to be where she is now.Most of you know that I’m an attorney and I actually do this kind of work. I am in fact a conservator myself, I take care of a disabled veteran - pay his bills, make decisions about his healthcare, stuff like that. I also talk to him on the phone most days and during Covid I would pick up cigarettes for him and other stuff he needed but could not have delivered otherwise. He has no family and we have a connection as veterans and I really don’t mind helping him. And I do not make that much money for the work and time spent as his conservator.When all the conservatorship issues with Britney came up there was also a film that came out about the same time, I Care A Lot, and many of us who practice in this area met with our judge and we discussed all of these issues. In my state someone can be disabled but still not need a conservator, I think this is true in most jurisdictions. Laws are set up to prevent someone from being taking advantage of and / or lost in the system. I recall our judge, who I greatly admire and respect, saying something to the effect of “can you even imagine this happening in this courtroom?” While the film shed light on abuses that could possibly happen, it was mostly wild fiction.The Britney Spears case, though, was bizarre. Folks who become wards of the court and whose lives are controlled by a conservator are usually very low functioning. They might have a part-time job at the grocery store or sweeping up at a family owned business. Most don’t work at all, cannot sustain employment in any fashion. How could she perform the way she did and still need a conservator? How could she dance and sing, with all the hours and hours of practice and choreography required, and appear on TV shows and meet fans and the public, and need a conservator? Another attorney and I looked at each other and decided we knew what the answer must be:California.I am very much a proponent of Justice Brandies’ famous adage about laboratories of democracy, advocating for a robust federal system where different states can have divergent procedural and even substantive laws concerning a great many areas of law. If the voters in California want those kinds of laws for conservators that’s their business.But damn.Anyway, this was entertaining but also maddening and depressing and lots of it was just sad. According to Britney, her parents were terrible, basically taking over her life for years. Many articles available online tell a different version of events, saying the conservatorship saved her life. Life can be complicated, there is much greater nuance to most things than what headlines tell us. I do find it noteworthy that while Britney supposedly needed a conservatorship, lived under the draconian rule of her over-controlling father, she did hundreds of shows and made lots of people millions of dollars, including this same father.This was written in a very informal, conversational style, easy to read and for the most part a good book. I also believe that, like many autobiographies, there was a lot that was left out. Even considering the gross misapplication of justice that took place for Britney, she glossed over much of the evidence against her. To be fair, she conceded a great deal as well. While this was never quite a torrid and steamy tell all, her relationship with Justin Timberlake and Kevin Federline and other celebrities does get some page time and we get to know some behind the scenes stories that were intriguing. We also get to know Britney the mother and her love for her sons was genuine and her pain at losing so much time with them was sincere.",3
948,The Woman in Me,"5.5 hours at 1X speed. An audiobook listener can binge this easily in an afternoon. Michelle Williams narrates the audiobook and I thought she did a good job.The book was ghostwritten and imo the first 40% seems too simple. It glosses over too many things and feels like a biography (it felt distanced). It’s when we hit the 40% mark that Britneys voice really shines through.This is such a sad memoir and not really a tell all. If you want to understand what Britney has been through and what has driven her to act out at times, then I recommend you pick this up. I feel so much for her and want only good things for her. Her family and all the stupid men in her life can fly a kite!Britney reminded me to see beyond what is portrayed on an IG feed or a photo in a gossip magazine. What would you do if your children were taken away from you? How would you react if the paparazzi followed you around constantly and caught you at your worst moments? How would you feel if your mother wrote a memoir about your mental breakdown and promoted it on tv instead of helping you or standing by your side when you needed her most? How would you feel if you didn’t have control over what you ate each day?I loved how she talked about sexism and double standards in the music industry and her admiration for Madonna. I love seeing and hearing her take back the power that was once not hers. A strong and powerful message.Everyone in her life has used her for their own fortune and fame and I don’t blame her that she uses mystery to surround her true self.I hope and pray that this story brings her peace and she finds comfort in people who love her for exactly who she is. A woman just wanting to be accepted and loved for the silly, lovable and spicy woman that she is.",4

952,Yellowface,"2.5/5i feel weird writing this review. for one, Yellowface isn’t out until next year. two, the book is very meta about twitter and book reviews—ratings on goodreads even make up several important plot points. i feel like me and the book are engaging in some inside joke.i’ve decided not to include any quotes from the book and talk in general terms with minor details to avoid spoilers (not anything that’s not in the premise, anyway), but i’m still talking about how i felt about different parts of the book, including the middle and end, even though I won’t be talking about what happens in them. so if you want to go in blind, beware. i know this runs the risk of me describing something one way, but then you going and reading it and interpreting a different way, but until it actually comes out and i can drop the ‘extended’ (and hopefully more sophisticated) review, this will have to do.yellowface is meant to be drama and dark satire. it’s a bit hilariously grim and grimly hilarious to anyone who’s ever needed to close booktwt and touch grass, but also interesting to anyone moderately familiar with books, writing or publishing. the prose isn’t babel, where i was stopping every page to savour the writing style, but it is fast-paced and fairly easy to get through. and i’m kind of torn about yellowface, but the worst part is that i can’t figure out whether it’s in a “this didn't work for me, personally” way, or a more objective “this is a Critique” way.my problem with yellowface comes down to the fact that i cannot separate the narrative voice from rfk’s voice at all. a lot of the experiences of a certain character lines up very much with what i know is rfk’s own, and that is on purpose and not necessarily bad—she’s an author who’s always been very open about putting a lot of herself into her books and it’s one of the things that can add to their emotional depth. a lot of readers will likely proclaim the fact you can’t unsee the hand of the author in the writing is The Point. however, when the characters start to receive criticisms that are very similar to criticisms rfk has faced, but represented somewhat flatly, i cock my head a bit. see: problematic representation of Taiwanese indigenous people (a criticism in isolation that depnding on the book may be valid, but in yellowface is shown to be made by people who are just jealous of the author and don’t actually know what they’re talking about), privately-educated, rich western diaspora writing about traumatic histories of working classes from the homelands they’ve only visited a few times (a criticism in isolation that depending on the author may be valid, but in yellowface is made from the perspective of the racist white woman using it to justify her horrible actions), etc.this may not bother other readers, but i can’t help but side-eye it. she gets around it by having these criticisms be made by mouthpieces—that’s another thing about yellowface, by the way.so many mouthpieces.i don’t think this is a book where readers will get very attached to the characters, not just because the mc is an unreliable narrator, but because yellowface is more of a book where characters are tools that represent different things and perspectives and are meant to be grimly watched, observed and laughed at from above. which is mostly fun, until you start to distinguish between rfk’s mouthpieces a bit: which ones she represents more flatly and more caricatured, and the one she gives more nuanced paragraphs to, from under which i think I can make out the haze of her opinions. and i’m not fond of them all the time.as always, it’s certainly interesting, but the middle of the book is basically all twitter discourse. it had me wondering if i could just scroll through my timeline and get the same experience instead. it’s veryyy meta—sometimes fun, sometimes obnoxious. maybe it’s too ‘high concept’ for me, sorry, or maybe it's heavy-handed. and it makes my job writing this difficult, because how much can i attribute to the unreliable narrator, satirical style or rfk herself? where does one end and the other begin, if they do so at all?(which was a big thing that irked me with tpw. people would make criticisms of rfk's narrative choices and plot points and the response would be ‘well, rin is an unreliable narrator!’ yes, but there is such thing asframingandcontextwhich are important things to consider when trying to figure out what an author actually is saying, intentionally or not. but anyways.)speaking of slightly more well-written unreliable narrators, juniper song is… a character. more of an awful ball of jealous, racist, liberal misery who you get to follow the entertaining downward spiral of throughout the book than a person. at least, when she's not hindered by rfk's blunt writing style striking her on the head. the commentary and discussion yellowface wants to have about publishing and racism is genuinely interesting and important, but I enjoyed yellowface most when it doing less back-and-forth with its own themes and more about the fucked up relationship between athena liu and juniper song/june hayward/athena liu. ie,when it was more about actual people than rfk's comemntary.despite athena dying at the very start of the story, she haunts the narrative, sometimes through flashbacks, sometimes through other people’s experiences, sometimes literally. and the narrativeisjuniper. i love a good fucked up friendship/rivalry/impersonation?/whatever the fuck this is. there's a flashback where we find out about a fucked up thing athena did regarding a traumatic event juniper went through--something which in no way justifies the scale of what juniper does throughout the book, but muddies the waters and makes everyone involved seem like more flawed, three-dimensional people. keyword, people! and whenever that relationship had the spotlight, i couldn’t put yellowface down. it's insane the narrative spent more time on its self-indulgent satire than it does on its genuinely compelling emotional core.which is why i was really loving the third act, in which a lot of my criticisms seemed to fall away and the mess of the premise was really coming to a head. i was reading it late at night and, even though it’s not a horror, i got actually creeped out by several parts. to be honest, if yellowface had stuck the landing, it could have been four stars.and that’s my final problem with yellowface. it has a decent plot, interesting cast of characters, interesting themes and discussions, but my only feeling on the ending was,‘…that’s it?’i know i said i wouldn’t do quotes, but im making an exception for the bit where our narrator says,‘I’ve written myself into a corner. The first two thirds of the book were a breeze to compose, but what do i do with the ending? Where do I leave my protagonist, now that there’s no clear resolution?’Which is very meta, because based off the ending, i feel that’s the position rfk was in at that exact point. i can somewhat tell she struggled with where to take the ending and i have more thoughts on why i felt underwhelmed by it, but i guess that’ll be for 2023, for when it's no doubt on all the 'Very Important Books of the Year' lists. for now, i can see myself rereading babel and parts of tpw, but i don’t see myself rereading yellowface.it's now 2023. in short, the ending is less a bang, and more of a whimper. rfk rules out a geoff-style ending for june, someone who disappears quietly from public memory after the scandal and becomes old news. she's too attached to athena's image. this is the right choice--june is too much of a villain-protagonist to get an unearned, 'soft' ending at the end of this. but then the 'crash-and-burn' ending needed to be a lot more to be satisfying for me. we get hallucinations, suicidal ideation, her isolating herself from her support network, all of this building and building and building--and then it goes...nowhere.oh, we get a fascinating final confrontation with candace, one of athena's fellow asian-american authors, who gets to deliver the most cutting, messy and brutal line of the book:""Who gives a fuck about Athena? Fuck Athena. We all hated that bitch. This is for me.""but what happens after?we get a prediction from june, which is basically that the cycle of controvery and scandal that this whole book has shown us for however many hundreds of pages will just keep going, and going, and going, and maybe june will win (at least in her eyes). it's just such a nothing ending. sure, it's #commentary and a criticism of the publishing and media industry, but that does not make it satisfying. it's not an emotional resolution, and it's not even a more sophisticated commentary on the cyclical nature of scandal and how white people don’t face consequences than what the story has shown us already. we'veseenthe cycle and her getting away with it. the whole book so far has been the cycle and her getting away with it. i think it's a good example of what i've been saying, to be honest, about how yellowface is more about The Point than any story it's trying to tell. The ending is all about The Point, but is not an emotional resolution to anything developed or a conclusion to any charater arcs. just ""and this will continue, because doesn't it always continue? isn't this ending so clever?"" the worst part is that itteasesyou with the prospect of something more compelling: june plays with the idea of 'accidentally' killing candace and knowing she would get away with it because she's a white woman, a horrific mirror to the start of the book and a sign of june's complete downward spiral, because at least Athena's death was an actual accident (and would be a frankly brutal commitment to the “they always get away with it” message). in a different moment, it makes you wonder if june may even be the one who might die an accidental death and now candace is the one to continue this twisted cycle, a horribly circular but somewhat karmic ending. instead, the cycle continues... in the most uninspired way possible. the third act of yellowface feels like it's hurtling towards a great ending and then face-plants over the finish line at the last minute. despite being a protagonist who is more well-suited for a crash-and-burn ending than any other i've read, juniper song doesn't burn. she barely sizzles. and to me, that's disappointing.trigger warnings for this book: racism, c slur, suicidal ideation, sexual assaultedit 24/05/2023:unsurprisingly, some people on twitter cannot fucking read, so to clarify some things: 1)i am not white. i am asian,2) I DO NOT CARE THAT JUNE WAS IRREDEEMABLE. I DID NOT WANT A REDEMPTION FOR A RACIST. my main problem was that i found the way yellowface handled its themes came at the cost of other aspects of the story when it should have been making them better. 3) ""[insert criticism here] is literally the whole point of the story omgggg how could you miss the point so bad did you even pass english lit in school etc etc."" personally, i do not enjoy 300 pages of on-the-nose commentary through uncompelling mouthpieces. i especially find it questionable when some of these mouthpieces flatly reflect criticisms the authors has actually received on her representation of taiwanese indigenous people. if you do, more power to you! if what i disliked about the book is what you enjoyed about it, well, that's just how having an opinion works. i don't know what to tell you. i can definitely understand how someone who isn't as aware of some of the meta-commentary would have more enjoyment. but i find the response that i ""missed the point"" (to be honest, the writing constantly tries its best to be Desperately Sure You Are Not Missing The Point) that this book is about racism by some white readers when i'm intimately familiar with racism, both as it pertains to real life and in media, kind of... well. racist.in a way, i guess this book is perfect for booktwitter. a lot of recognisable discourse where the Message and Themes are written out for you in big bold letters, constantly, all the time, throughout the story, just in case you missed it—that way, even your average reading-comprehension-starved twitter user can pick up on it—padded with enough relatable material about being chronically online and plenty of fictional ragebait to distract from a narrative that can’t get its teeth into its own premise and a third act that can’t deliver. target audience acquired.in line with the theme of the book, i’m going to completely steal another reviewer’s words that i can’t stop thinking about.'the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope.'go read it. and i’d like to add to that: a lot of her most avid readers don’t have the appetite for anything beyond that, either. and take it incredibly personally when at the end of the meal, you’re still hungry.and to be clear, this isn't a blanket response to everyone who disagrees with me (i've had interesting conversations with people who do)--just to some people who are determined to take the most uncharitable opinion possible of a frankly lukewarm review.a book can be about an important subject matter and i can still feel it fell short of what it was trying to do. that is not me putting personal attack on the author, the author's identity, the subject matter itself, or any readers who enjoyed the book or their identities. i didn't even hate the book. i liked parts of it quite a bit. i just wanted more.",2
953,Yellowface,"**2023 Goodreads Choice Award Winner**‘What more can we want as writers than such immortality? Don’t ghosts just want to be remembered?’A book about fucking around and finding out.The question of who should or shouldn’t tell a story has been a hotly debated subject, a discourse that must also recognize the playing field is guided by rules of capitalism in a for-profit publishing industry and a social climate that prods “culture wars” to increase clicks. Still in recent memory are the debates overAmerican Dirt, which sparkedmonths of controversyover white authors using another’s cultural narrative as what many considered “trauma porn,” but also over the publisher’s decision to throw incredible amounts of marketing money at this book when immigration stories by authors living within the culture were being passed over for that novel. R.F. Kuang’sYellowfacesinks its teeth into the world of publishing and the discourses on authenticity through the eyes of June Hayward, a white woman who has taken the draft of a Chinese-American woman’s novel and published it as her own. She will forever be haunted by this choice, like a Lady Macbeth of letters haunted by bloodstains in her attempt to usurp the kingdom. It is a perfect follow-up toBabeland the conversations on how language can be a form of colonialism, though this one has no magical elements like the former. Instead,Yellowfacereads like a scandal unfolding before your eyes and transfixes the reader with all the sick satisfactions that keep us scrolling through social media debates and keep hot takes. Kuang makes us sit with our discomfort, through an excellent choice of an unreliable narrator, and forces us to confront our own opinions on the matter. With a sharp critique on the commodification and consumption of art in publishing and reviewing (even Goodreaders are not spared here), a look at online debates, the self-aggrandizing aspects of social media, and the way artists are pitted against each other as if writing was a competitive sport, Kuang’sYellowfaceasks big questions on authenticity and identity in a society that has reduced the concepts into marketing metrics.I’ll be honest, I read this book in a single sitting. I could not look away, and Kuang’s writing sweeps you up in it’s conversational cadance. While I’ve enjoyed Kuang’s writing previously,Yellowfacefeels very polished and matured, the novel reading with the ease and eagerness of a tell-all memoir, which is the framing of the story. As a fictional memoir, it drops a lot of pop culture references to key into a specific time. Kuang’s choice of perspective through June—who rebrands at the request of her publisher as Juniper Song, Song being her middle-name but also nudges readers to think she may have Chinese heritage—is brilliant as it allows us to feel the floor-dropping-out discomfort of becoming the focus of internet rage as well as navigate a vigorous criticism of the publishing industry. Kuang is able to cover issues without moralizing, making the reader sift through alternating opinions that are likely to expose their own assumptions and discomforts, and we must always remember the telling is often guiding us away from judging her and towards everyone else. With a big confession at the center, June can manipulate the reader on smaller issues and in a way it becomes a rather metafictional approach to the way storytelling is just that: fictionalizing stories.Kuang does well by creating a character that isn’t entirely unsympathetic—we need to want to keep reading her take on the events—and hate reading is a shallow effect that evaporates quickly. Not unlike the social media scandals that hit viciously and are forgotten days later. Not that June is innocent, and being disgusted with her is half the fun, but Kuang will force us to consider what exactly it is that disgusts us and what that means in a larger context about art and the commodification of it. We’ve seen these sorts of scandals, such as a personal favorite bizarre tale of Natalie Beach who wrote about beingthe ghostwriter for Caroline Calloway, or last year’sWho Is the Bad Art Friend?article concerning Sonya Larson and Dawn Dorland where everyone seemed to be too thrilled by the mess to not pick a side. Though the story that seems closest toYellowfaceis the one surroundingKristen Roupenian’s short storyCat Person(you canread it here). First everyone rushed to defend it against those who claimed it was misandrist, then camethe article revealing the details was taken from a strangers real life, told to the author by the man who was fictionalized in the story as the sex pest and later committed suicide in real life. Twitter was full of well-known authors debating if personal details and stories of others are always fair game, even though the hometown and place of employment of the girl was not changed for the published version (my college roommate later rented the house Roupenian had previously lived in and describes in story). Literary twitter was confronted with a situation about what level of authenticity is appropriate and can someone tell someone else’s story.The way social media fuels a fire is at the heart of this story, with twitter challenging authenticity and morals at all times. Which becomes a tragic interplay at the way authors are demanded to be vulnerable, to seek authenticity and expose their pain for book sales, yet social media loves to exploit personal details and use vulnerabilities as an opening for an attack.‘dozen, maybe hundreds, maybethousandsof strangers are out there, mining your personal information, worming their ways into your life, looking for ways to mock, humiliate, or worse, endanger you. You come to regret everything you’ve ever shared about yourself…because the trollswillfind them.’We’ve all most likely criticized a stranger on social media, sometimes the pile-ups are too fun and humorous to not get a joke in, but Kuang tries to remind us that the targets are real people with real feelings. Sure, June deserves to be exposed and feel bad for what she’s done, but Kuang puts us in her shoes and lets you feel what being a target is like. Because it can come for anyone, even Athena was once the target of harassment, death threats and hacking where she didn’t feel safe all for being called a ‘race traitor’ for dating a white man. ‘In destroying her,’ June narrates the voice of social media, ‘we create an audience we create moral authority for ourselves.’ Such is the nature of social media in the state of a scandal, and all for what? ‘Allegations get flung left and right, everyone’s reputations are torn down, and when the dust clears, everything remains exactly as it was.’ Nothing changes, but, as we see in the novel, much of this is because someone profits from it. A scandal often turns into book sales (for as many people complainedAmerican Dirtwas canceled it still remained a bestseller for months, I witnessed many people purchase it saying they “had to know firsthand now”) and if you keep selling books you keep getting published.‘The living are burdened with bodies. They make shadows, footprints.’But lets move to the scandal at hand. Here we have June, who has a tepid friendship with rising literary star Athena Liu. She feels jealous as well as annoyance with Athena, fantasizing how she’d like to ‘neatly peel her skin off her body like an orange and zip it up over myself,’ something she is soon metaphorically doing when she edits the now deceased Athena’s manuscript: a WW1 novel about Chinese laborers. It starts off innocently enough (or so June claims) being an exercise in editing that she gets so caught up in loving writing again that she passes it off as herself. It is titledThe Last Front, is praised for a mosaic storytelling style reminiscent of the filmDunkirkand becomes an instant bestseller. She will spend the novel fiercely defending she has the right to tell this story—sometimes being rewarded such as when speaking at a Chinese American Social Club she is thanked by a man who’s Chinese father fought in the war for making sure their stories are told—yet at the end of the day, this never was her story. And while she can be a great writer, we see she is never able to come up with her own ideas and the ones she have is derivative of other stories. It is a subtle and clever nod to a gap between being a good writer and being a good author or creator (an offer to write for existing IP disgusts her, perhaps because she is confronted by what she doesn’t want to admit is her strength).‘It all boils down to self-interest…If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it's rigged in your favor.’While the marketing grab here is definitely the idea of colonizing another’s work and culture and passing it off as your own (there are many moments for readers to fist bump the novel and say “HAHA take that shit, “Junie””) Kuang makes this a symptom of a larger issue. In her acknowledgements, Kuang states that the novel is a ‘horror story about loneliness in a fiercely competitive industry.’ If your ears perked up at horror story, therearesome horror elements late in the novel (though perhaps not enough and it could have been threaded in longer, if I have one complaint it is that the novels episodic feel never quite let individual elements breathe enough and makes the last portion feel a bit like going one step more than needed instead of flowing from the book which would have sidestepped that feeling? Maybe thats just me though). But loneliness does permeate this tale, and we see how authors can feel crushed under the way for-profit publishing makes it a competition who awards winners and losers. One author will get a huge deal and seemingly inexhaustible marketing, while another gets one small print run and no publisher support. Kuang looks at publishing as a rigged enterprise, with a small team of (mostly white) executives deciding what gets sold and more or less deciding what will be a bestseller and informing readers to follow suit. Its not a secret that publishers buy space in chain bookstores or that the Big 5 US publishers are80% of all publishing revenue. It is a market based on profit, and will be manipulated to ensure profits keep coming.‘This industry is built on silencing us, stomping us into the ground, and hurling money at white people to produce racist stereotypes of us.’To June, however, she sees diversity as a problem, thinking she is passed over for authors like Athena because it looks good. Which, if we look at the publishing market, shows that about75% of published authors in the US are whiteand a 2020 study showed95% of all books published were by white authorsthe previous year.Now everyone probably remembers 2020 was the year many corporations made pledges to be better at diversity, the publishing industry under extra scrutiny as Black authors and anti-racism books were topping the best sellers and showing there was indeed a market for such books, but lets look at the industry itself. Since then,a recent survey shows only a 1% changein the industry, with it being 83% white and that most non-white hires since 2020 are for marketing positions. Which is using “diversity” as a sales technique again.So what June see’s as a fast-track to success is actually a steep uphill climb. ‘""Do you know how much shit Athena got from this industry?’ a character remarks late in the novel, ‘They marked her as their token, exotic Asian girl. Every time she tried to branch out to new projects, they kept insisting that Asian was her brand, was what her audience expected.’ To be a brand is what publishing reduces identity into is the argument seen in the novel. And, if one is reduced to being a brand of themselves, they are now in market competition. I think of author Brandon Taylor saying identity becomes a marketing pitch, and howReal Lifewas reviewed as about identity when he says it was about lonely that happened to have explorations of identity in the book. I'm reminded of thereasons authors pushed against #OwnVoiceslabels asBecky Albertallifelt forced to come out to ""justify"" her book and others felt boxed in by it.‘Do you know what it's like to pitch a book and be told they already have an Asian writer? That they can't put out two minority stories in the same season? That Athena Liu already exists, so you're redundant?’Kuang examines how the idea of being a brand exists in the outskirts of publishing as well. We have the twitter fights where people exist as a self-brand of being antagonists, we have goodreads reviewers where their brand is taking down popular authors (some lines that may sting are remarks from other authors to not read goodreads and harsh takes are more about feeding ego than worthwhile criticism), and journalists who make a brand at hot takes. However, we have to remember that June is directing us to look at howeveryone elseis the problem instead of her. So while through her telling many of the critiques are cast as villains, the fictional journalist Adele Sparks-Sato (a nod toAndrea Long ChuasVartika pointed out) is not wrong when writing that June’s version of Athena’s novel ‘joins novels likeThe HelpandThe Good Earthin a long line of what I dub historical exploitation novels: inauthentic stories that use troubled pasts as an entertaining set piece for white entertainment.’‘The appropriation of history, the historicization of the past, the narrativization of society, all of which give the novel its force, include the accumulation and differentiation of social space, space to be used for social purposes.’-Edward Said,Culture and ImperialismThere is a good deal of nuance in this book about how the commodification of art is an issue, but also a reminder that we can’t scapegoat our own actions on that entirely. There are some great little jabs in this—Junie Song ordering a Miss Saigon drink only to find it “too sweet” for her tastes—and it does emphasize the problems of representing a different culture from a western lens. AsEdward Saidwrote ‘the power to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming and emerging is very important to culture and imperialism,’ and argued that literature can be a form of colonialism by establishing a perception of a different culture or geography, and in the editing process ofThe Last Frontwe watch June make concessions on the text in order to appeal more to a white reader as requested by her publisher. Yes, she did actually do a great deal of research, and her opinion is the criticisms of cultural issues in the book are ‘exclusive cultural snobbishness and authenticity testing’ that ‘are only a form of gatekeeping,’ though later criticisms of her book are that her misunderstanding of how names or families work, or how her positions on certain issues imply a stance on current Chinese politics that are so beyond her understanding can be harmful. Some readers find it to read as a white-savioir narrative, something we know was manufactured by changing certain characters to be white characters to better fit the market needs. Which also returns us to the idea that art under capitalism will always be in service to profits. At the end of the day, don't steal a novel to talk over the voices of those who the stories belong to.Yellowfaceby R.F. Kuang is a delightful novel with the fierceness of an unfolding scandal that makes us confront many key issues hotly debated in the literary world right now. I enjoyed the nuance here in how it exposes problems from many angles, but does not allow that to be an excuse for bad behavior. Understanding is not the same as condoning here, and it is a page-turning trip watching June dip and dodge as her usurped empire continuously threatens to crash down around her. Kuang writes with confidence and precision andYellowfacemakes for an excellent look at the literary world and the commodification of art.4.5/5‘Isn’t that what ghosts do? Howl, moan, make themselves into spectacles? That’s the whole point of a ghost, is it not? Anything to remind you that they’re still there. Anything to keep you from forgetting.’",4
954,Yellowface,"lmao.the frustration, as always, is that rf kuang is an intelligent and steady-handed writer. she is ahead of many of her peers in craft as much as sales: she writes a page-turner, she crafts a strong perspective, she is horror-writer good at making the reader feel gut-churning revulsion (whether or not she earns the strong emotion she likes to pull out is another question), and in this book she's capable of being funny. like here's a perfect paragraph, in which our pernicious white heroine works with her editor to chop and change the manuscript she stole:The hardest part is keeping track of all the characters. We change almost a dozen names to reduce confusion. Two different characters have the last name Zhang, and four have the last name Li. Athena differentiates them by giving them different first names, which she only occasionally uses, and other names that I assume are nicknames (A Geng, A Zhu; unless A is a last name and I’m missing something), or Da Liu and Xiao Liu, which throws me for a loop because I thought Liu was a last name, so what are Da and Xiao doing there? Why are so many of the female characters named Xiao as well? And if they’re family names, does that mean everyone is related? Is this a novel aboutincest? But the easy fix is to give them all distinct monikers, and I spend hours scrolling through pages on Chinese history and baby name sites to find names that will be culturally appropriate.like it's absolutely executing all of its tricks as it should: the blinkers of a close first person perspective, the legible different reality underneath. it's not subtle but when done in satire it's not AS hamhanded as kuang's dramatic instincts, per other books. readers who know chinese will scream, readers who don't will still feel their brain itch. the authorial hand is capable.the author is capable... of more than she writes. the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope. in previous books that meant that the sense of history was strong and the rest of the work of writing fiction—character work, plot, tone, anything reliant on the imagination—was comparatively weak. here there's no research to hold it up, just kuang's own posting habits and career success. the step down from jstor to twitter is a violent stumble.kuang is an accomplished academic but a deeply incurious writer. that is on sharp display here, in a book that is meant to depict success and failure in the literary-commercial circuit—something that kuang knows little about. kuang is a genre writer who achieved crossover commercial success after blowing up on tiktok. her debut was promising and lauded but not uniquely vaunted; she received genre award noms (not wins) but her books blew up on tiktok after the fact and she launched an incredibly successful book this yearin the genre space, off the back of her tiktok fame. everything she knows about succeeding she knows about inside her particular bubble, and also, because she has been succeeding since she was an undergrad baby, has been told—and genuinely believes—that she has hit the summit of success. this leaves her totally inequipped to write about what literary success looks like when engineered by the house. r.f. kuang has no belief that there is a form of publishing greatness beyond that which has been bestowed upon r.f. kuang, and a wilful desire not to google further.the 'publishing details' on display are... well, they all exist IN publishing, curate a FORM of commercial success, and are familiar to kuang, but they don't match the book as described here (a lit-commercial wwii doorstopper, written by a chinese-american author and butchered into commercial sentimentality by a white author and editor, think the bulletproof success of american dirt even in the thick of its cancellation). mainstream literary successes don't come up through pitchwars. mainstream commercial novels don't come up in most book box deals because there is a form of literary success that is not reliant on superfans buying multiple copies apiece. there's a part where our heroine lists the major american literary awards her major literary-commercial war novel is up for and starts with: the goodreads choice awards. posting FROM this bad website: please be serious. it's fitting that the cover looks more like a designed arc than like a book.there's a note in the babel prologue that i think about all the time with kuang's work, where she says that she was so dazzled by the sight of an oyster tower at a particular oxford party that she put it in the book even though oysters in victorian england were trash food for peasants—she didn't want to capture the dazzle or the waste so much as she wanted to write down her experience beat for beat, and could not conceive of an emotional reality that she did not personally live. this is an oyster tower book. this is embarrassing and technically inaccurate mimesis all the way down, solely interested in kuang's own interests. wow your heroines live in dc? and you lived in dc? they met at yale? you go to yale? omigod rebecca that's so crazy. there was a shorthand term back in the sporking days (i know, i hate my withered hag fingers for typing this too) on LIVEJOURNAL (HAG FINGERS) called 'pepper jack cheese' that was like ""hermione ate a sandwich with pepper jack cheese (a/n: that's my favorite cheese!)"", the phenomenon where the author would gigglingly and obviously insert a few of their real-life favorite things into the story. kuang's pepper jack cheese is whistlepig whiskey, name-dropped bafflingly twice as a signifier for the nicest possible whiskey, and also every single detail.it is like. skin-crawlingly secondhand embarrassing to watch an author write their own life beat for beat and also be like 'everyone hated her because she was TOO pretty and TOO smart'. every critique that has ever been leveled against kuang goes into the mouth of her proxy's haters, including the pernicious and grasping white heroine. the belief that her haters are racist comes in a distant second to the belief that her haters are jealous—of her success, of her telegenic prettiness, of her comfortable life. maybe baby but look at the material: there's room for improvement. it is disappointing to watch someone technically skilled grind their intellectual curiosity down to a nub via posting and self-obsession, and it's humiliating to watch an oxbridge-ivy phd student say 'talk to the hand! and DON'T tell me to log off' for three hundo pages. is this the best she can do? does SHE think this is the best she can do? i'm worried that she does.",2
955,Yellowface,"Whew child. Some of these reviews are doing exactly what Kuang was pointing out throughYellowface. It’s interesting to watch it happen in real time. While I don’t have extensive knowledge of her work, I think what Kuang is doing in this book is actually quite brilliant.At the most basic of levels,Yellowfaceis a mash of various genres that follows the passive aggressive “friendship” of Athena and June, two authors in the publishing industry with very different levels of success. Athena has received her big break while June has remained a struggling author. In an absurd (truly absurd if I’m being quite honest haha) turn of events, Athena chokes while engaging in a pancake eating contest with June. After her death, June makes the decision to steal one of her manuscripts and pass it off as her own. What follows next is chaotic descent into the world of publishing and the book community.What Worked:SO MUCH OF THIS BOOOK WORKED! I’ve seen the countless criticisms of Kuang inserting herself too much into this book as well as the criticisms that indicate that there isn’t much to be gained from reading this book. I wholeheartedly disagree. Oh, my friends, there is much to be gained. Neither of the characters is likeable and that is INTENTIONAL. This isn’t a way to illustrate that everyone in publishing is selfish, but a means to question how much the reader falls into the trap of engaging with the model minority myth. The expectation that Athena is supposed to be likeable is deeply woven in the sociological phenomena that stereotypes many Asian communities as successful, smart, likeable, diligent, docile, etc and the idea that Athena doesn’t fit into that role has made some readers feel uncomfortable whether it is consciously or subconsciously.Kuang’s evaluation of the publishing industry is layered and forces both publishing and the bookish community to do some reevaluation. What she singlehandedly captures in this book has been the biggest criticism that many of us have been vocal about since 2020. Publishing used the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement to claim to want more diversity and has in some ways published more diverse books; however, have we really paid attention to what those stories have centered? Trauma versus joy. So many of these stories have been centered on generational trauma, books that are used to educate and make the White masses feel better about not knowing much about diverse experiences prior to 2020. Marginalized voices in publishing are “permitted” to be a part of the community as long we play the roles that we are supposed to play. Once we begin to infiltrate the industry too much, those same people with “BLM” in their twitter bios, the same people who claim to be liberal do the same damn mental gymnastics June did to excuse her behavior. The system was designed for June to do what she did and the moment that marginalized communities “steal” the shine, it’s okay to push back because as June believes she’s the true minority and oppressed person in all of this. Don’t believe me, you should check out the TikTok made by an author who claims that white writers now get turned down because all agents want are BIPOC writers. Or better yet, just listen to foolishness that was uttered from James Patterson who had the audacity to state the White men are the truly oppressed writers in the industry.And let’s take this a step further and look at how Kuang illustrated the danger that publishing has ultimately created with it’s use of terms like #ownvoices. Athena wasn’t ever allowed to write outside of trauma. She’s pigeonholed into only writing one thing. And honestly, I’m sure that happens more than we would like to believe. Authors who want to explore something outside of their “assigned” roles either get turned down or the marketing is trash. It delves deeper into the question of who is allowed to tell what story? Was Athena any better of a fit to tell the story of Chinese laborers of WWI than June? Is research enough to tell something outside of one’s lived experience? These are things to think about and something that we are confronted with every day in this community. Think about books likeAmerican DirtandMemoirs of a Geisha.This book is both absurd and unhinged because so is publishing and the book community. And I’ve been involved in all of it for so many years. Kuang told ya’ll to kiss her ass with this book. She is behaving in the complete opposite manner that is “expected” of her as young, thin, conventionally beautiful Asian woman. And the fact that she owns that shit makes so many people feel uncomfortable. And quite frankly I applaud her for that. BIPOC writers and creators are tired of the expectation that we are supposed to behave, create, write, and provide educational pieces in way that makes others feel comfortable. We’re supposed to applaud White people for the amazing work they’ve done in “allowing” us to enter the spaces and “give” us the opportunity to tell “our stories.” It’s laughable at this point and while ya’ll give Kuang these 1 and 2 star reviews, she’s going to be laughing her pretty, thin, and educated ass all the way to the damn bank.",5
956,Yellowface,"At this point I'd read Rebecca's grocery lists“She’s using the pen name Juniper Song to pretend to be Chinese American. She’s taken new author photos to look more tan and ethnic, but she’s as white as they come. June Hayward, you are a thief and a liar. You’ve stolen my legacy, and now you spit on my grave.”This book was a fascinating look into the mind of the worst kind of person in the online bookish community.Every chapter was like watching a trainwreck. I knew it would just get worse but I could not for the life of me look away.June was unhinged. The kind of unhinged that believes her own lies and thinks she is morally in the right. Girl took delulu to another level.What astounded me most was how legitimately real her voice was. Hats off to Rebecca Kuang. She killed this.Honestly i had fun reading this book. It incited so many feelings in me (mainly rage and distress). There were parts where i was in utter disbelief of June, i had to take a step back from the book.I do wonder though, what with all the niche references to the recurring bookish online drama and controversy that gets dragged up month in and month out, how a casual book reader would experience this book 🤔.",4
957,Yellowface,"this book is so goddamn annoying.i love satire.this was like reading the diary entry of someone who has just had an extremely bad day at work. it was like that trope that seems for some reason very exclusive to the mid-2000s in which people have the worst day of their lives are doomed to relive it, or die and go to purgatory or something like that enjoyed a specific renaissance in spirit in this book.and it was so frustrating.but it was also F U N.it was very heavy-handed, and pretty self-indulgent, but i love three things in this life and those are mean girls, and b*tching with my friends, and books, and this was all three of them in one.it was a mess. but i liked it anyway.and everyone who is getting a little prickly over it is only doing so because they see themselves in it. because this all feels so very true!!!bottom line: people are the worst and so is this book and i'm a fan of all of it.-----------------tbr reviewthis book is already polarizing and its release date is 6 months away. so yeah i want to read itupdate: let's do this.",4
958,Yellowface,"i wanted to like this so much more, but unfortunately it felt really flat to me :(what i expected to be an insightful critique of racism in the publishing industry turned out to be more of a jab at twitter discourse? more than anything, it felt like the author was using the main character to respond to real life criticism she’s received, which isn’t inherently bad, but it made the story feel a bit shallow.i think rfk is an extremely talented writer, which is why my expectations were so high. i just feel like this book had the potential to say so much more, but i finished it thinking, “that’s it?”",3

960,Yellowface,"This is a compelling, cynical, and thought-provoking satire that delves into themes of plagiarism, racism, and internet trolling. It offers a realistic portrayal of the publishing industry within the framework of a heart-pounding thriller. The story revolves around an anti-heroine driven by power and insecurity, who assumes the identity of her deceased friend to publish a masterpiece. Loneliness and the desperate desire for recognition serve as driving forces, pushing the protagonist to extreme measures.Remarkably, I found myself attached to a book despite disliking the main character. At times, I wished I could physically enter the story and confront June Hayward/ Juniper Song, who committed the ultimate crime: stealing her late friend Athena Liu's unpublished book. The reasons behind this act of creative theft are complex and include jealousy, thirst for power, honoring her friend's work in the best way possible, and seeking personal gain. It is a tale that explores unfairness, harbored resentment, and a thirst for karmic justice.One of the standout aspects of the book is the author's astute commentary on the perils faced by writers, such as internet trolls who use their freedom of speech rights to berate and belittle their creations. The story skillfully examines the commodification of writers, where their looks, personality, color of their skin and online presence become as important as their writing itself.This book truly blew my mind. I was unable to put it down, yet also needed to take breaks due to the chaotic and anxiety-inducing experience of living within Juniper's mind. The character evokes strong emotions, including frustration towards her misogyny, blind ambition, and obnoxious justifications for her actions.It is worth noting that Juniper is not the sole antagonist in the narrative. The judgmental and self-righteous individuals surrounding her also exhibit misogynistic tendencies and relish in criticizing and witnessing the downfall of others, all while raising their champagne glasses in celebration. Even Athena, portrayed as socially awkward and naive, adds depth to the story as a potential soul-sucking character for a gripping plotline.In this book, nobody is a saint, as being good-hearted does not guarantee financial security, career success, fame, or power. The author skillfully portrays flawed and complex characters who challenge the reader's perceptions.Overall, this realistic and thrilling read left me feeling anxious and evoked a multitude of emotions including fear, hate, and sadness. It successfully accomplished its mission of shaking the reader to their core and provoking deep thoughts that linger for days. The essence of a masterpiece lies in its ability to challenge readers and evoke a range of feelings, and this book achieves just that.I wholeheartedly consider this one of the best books of the year, and I urge you not to overlook it or let it languish in your ""to be read"" list. Grab a copy and immerse yourself in its urgent and captivating narrative.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
961,Yellowface,"July 2023 ⭐️4.5I reread this for my book club and am so glad we did a buddy read and live show. This is a book worthy of discussion. It has both blatant and nuanced themes of racism and xenophobia that might go over some reader's heads or might seem too in-your-face for others. A group discussion can help reader's recognize the realism of R.F. Kuang's literary approach and see that even if you don't relate to the content, you still have to understand that it's other people's reality.Will you enjoy a single character? Categorically NO. But you will walk away with a greater understanding of the many failings of the publishing industry and how you might be unconsciously taking part in some of those failings.It's eye opening. It's ballsy. It's crass. It's wild and brilliant.I will say that the half star reduction is solely because of Candice. While her insistence upon sensitivity reader's was a good call in my opinion, her manner of calling things out and getting things done were over-dramatized to the nth degree. While I think R.F. Kuang is brilliant for having the opposing side of June also be contrarian, Candice didn't fill the spot I wanted her to in opposition to June. I know it wasn't a character to necessarily root for instead of June. But I saw June's motives and her horrible mental manipulation that she attempted to gaslight ourselves into believing were just. But Candice just felt cartoonishly villainous. Maybe that's just my view of her. Other's could read it differently.But, overall, this is absolutely worth your time. Please read this. It is a shining gem in the 2023 literary world.March 2023 ⭐️4.5RF Kuang DID THAT.This woman fears nothing and no one. What a hero.She said ""Talk about the publishing industry? How about the racism, misogyny, xenophobia, plagiarism, pretty-privilege and everything else revolting that comes along with it? You don't want to acknowledge that? Welp, too bad. Cause I'm gonna write it so well, you'll be begging to publish it.""I thought that RF Kuang was going to write about her experience with publishing through the eyes of the main character. But that's the direct opposite approach she takes. Her self-insert is actually with Athena, the main character's college friend turned renowned author.The main character is a depiction of mild mannered racist individuals who shroud themselves in acceptance as long as it doesn't affect them and balk at the idea of racism until directly faced with equality and the loss of superiority it gives them.This is an excellent look at how real and deep rooted racism is. It's everywhere and in everyone. It just isn't always shouting it's ideals. It's sitting still while someone else does something harmful. It's deluding yourself when you get the job over someone of color when you know you're under qualified. It's in so many small and micro ways. And it's absolutely vile to watch/read. But very eye opening in a way that I think is necessary for the publishing industry as it stands.I so appreciate RF Kuang for writing this and continuing to be an absolute genius. Like, how does a human being's brain contain this much complexity and eloquence? I'm baffled.",5
962,Yellowface,"i'm being generous already when i say that it is OK, because i personally do not like these kinds of books. while i appreciate the social commentary and the look inside the publishing industry, i found the tone and execution quite heavy-handed.it's certainly well-written, but personally i didn't like the writing style or the narrative voice. i know rfk intended the characters to be unlikeable, but i did not root for them at any point of the book. i was irritated most of the time, so i can't really say that i enjoyed reading this. i've read my fair share of books peopled with unlikeable characters, but this one here is just unbearable and repetitive. it got so boring the last third of the book that i had to take a nap before continuing.i think my main problem is that the author's personal voice bleeds through the text and does not give the reader much room to think. rfk frames the story in a way that clearly shows the readers what she thinks and, in a way, she's telling us what to think. in tpw i excused it as a debut author's mistake, while in babel i found her passion about the themes charming— but here in yellowface i realize that rfk is unfortunately incapable of separating her own voice from the text, which is very grating to my brain. i won't get into the specifics, but it's just SO irritating to read. it's satirical and supposed to be ""darkly funny"" but i guess i just did not understand the jokes (wherever they may be). i also think that i would have appreciated the book more had it cut back on the pop culture references (which i do not think will age well btw). i would have liked this more had it been written with more finesse and subtlety.anyway, i don't think rfk is cut out to write in this genre.ARC received in exchange for an honest review",1
963,Yellowface,"with some personal favourites like‘the plot,’ ‘a ladder to the sky,’and‘kill all your darlings,’im no stranger to a plot about plagiarism. but what makes this book stand out from the others is its hard hitting commentary about the publishing world.RFK is a fantastic writer and skillfully navigates the loneliness and pressure authors feel, making the drastic decisions juniper makes feel somewhat morally grey rather than outright wrong (as we know plagiarism is). and even though its done in a satirical way (which isnt my favourite), i enjoyed the exploration of topics like authors in reader spaces, own voices stories, and the different standards and treatment of white vs minority authors.the only reason this isnt getting 5 stars is because of a personal problem. i have a really weird pet peeve of real world things mentioned in fiction. i like realistic/contemporary stories, but pop culture references bug the crap out of me. so all of the talk of US politics and presidents, very real famous authors, even the commentary about goodreads and tiktok, took me out of the story.so, a little too “real world” for my personal reading preferences, but there is no doubt this is a provocative novel that sheds light on various aspects of the book world.↠4 stars",4
964,Yellowface,"haha i can't wait for this to come out and for y'all to lose your minds. if you had doubts about preordering, don't. you're going to want to read this one—satire at its f**king finest",5
965,Yellowface,"HOLY SHIT.I bet any other author could have tried with a premise like this and would have inevitably failed.No one writes morally grey like R.F. Kuang and I'm saying this because my anxiety skyrocketed the more I read + I'm still haunted by these characters days later.It basically was like a trainwreck from beginning to end, where you know things are only getting worse but you're still so weirdly fascinated with it you can't stop looking.I'm positive I've never read something so meta in my entire life.This one is for the publishing industry nerds, and honestly I foresee this being very difficult to market outside of such a niche community. It was so in-depth into the industry it made my heart sing and despare at the same time (as a publishing post-graduate first and then as a compulsive reader part of the online community). It managed to highlight a slew of things that make publishing not such a great place to be at in very few pages and I'm amazed. To me this book kind of felt like a very long article but with twists and turns. Now I know why they released arcs so early (looking at you, HarperCollins 👀). Book twitter will have a field day with this one...What a choice to have the main narrative voice be the plagiarizer (and in first person at that).Both Athena and June are awful people, and I love that neither of them is a saint, but reading the entire thing from June's pov? Insane. She's a frustrating character, not gonna lie, but she's also deliciously realistic as a two-faced, self-absorbed and dishonest manipulator that always has an excuse ready. She goes out of her way to say to the reader that she wants to do something for poc every chance she gets, but the reality is that she's a bitch trying to profit from it all in an industry that lets her do it. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's not too difficult to miss her slipping into a plain wrong mentality and lol, basic whiteness.You think you're safe as the external reader? Not a chance.I'm not proud to say I fell straight into R.F. Kuang's trap, because was I seriously rooting for such a cheater the entire time? This book brainwashed me into supporting someone who stole a whole manuscript immediately after witnessing the author's death and reaching stardom by publishing it as her own. I got to the point where I was scared she was going to get caught and hoped she would get out of it unscathed.My brain ignored all the red flags and procedeed to scam me until the very end.I mean, of course I ended up wishing she would kill someone to shut them up. Of course I got second-hand anxiety from her messing up with her publishing team and at her events. Of course I cared about her mental health. Am I okay or what? Is it time for me to get theraphy too?On the other hand, Athena is harder to grasp.You really need to have the whole picture with her, which you only get by reading the book till the end.I loved the way RFK slowly built her character. You only read about her from June's perpective when she's already dead and still she comes through as the main character, not less because June is literally obsessed with her. Well-written toxic friendships are my bread and butter and the one in here was one of my favorites. The way it was dealt with: nothing less of spectacular. I found June's morality to be the most interesting aspect of this book, but the relationship between her and Athena comes in second for sure.Much care went into the secondary characters too.Even when they only fully appeared once or twice, they always had a well-rounded story behind them.I can apply that specifically to the publishing team and Geoff. From that last one it's again apparent and so on-the-nose how me and RFK's morally grey characters just work together. What can I say? I'm fascinated with them. Geoff reminded me of so many white male authors on twitter but he just had a pull. I loved that he was so pathetic, that I never knew what he was going to do and then, when I least expected it and as naturally as possible, he showed a completely different side to himself.There are a couple of things I didn't completely enjoy, mainly the pop culture references (way too many, half of them were necessary, the others not so much), and the ending.Overall the ending itself wasn't bad, I loved how it wrapped up, but that final showdown bordered on cartoonish and because of that it was hard to take it seriously. I also feel like the final chapter is missing, although I understand what this novel is actually supposed to be (have I said meta already?).In conclusion, an amazing foray into general fiction by R.F. Kuang. I swear this woman can do no wrong. Give her whatever topic to write about and I bet she can create something incredible out of the most boring premise.I think it's impressive how she took these modern controversies and wrote them into a twisty unputdownable story.It seems to me like it's a new experiment from her but at the same time a really smart jab at publishing too.I wouldn't say it's a perfect book and I'm unsure if I would reread it likeThe Poppy Wartrilogy; however I can't exclude it won't live in my mind rent free as I still catch myself heavily thinking about it.",4
966,Yellowface,"probably the only one of my most anticipated books of 2023 to live up to the hype.this was brilliant, insightful, uncomfortable, and sure maybe a little self-inserty. but authors, especially good authors, have every right to infuse themselves into their stories. i'd much rather read a book that feels cathartic for an author to write, with true depth of emotion, than something devoid of the author's passion.there were parts of this i didn't love. namely the pacing and the ending of the book. but the cutting satire and painfully accurate characterization shone through. i think members of the book community should read this. it helped me recognize some uncomfy truths and hey, only the best books do.",5
967,Yellowface,"Oh, Booktwitter, Bookstagram! You lied.This wasn't v. good.Yellowface is about June Heyward who steals a manuscript from her best-selling author frenemy. After her friend dies in a bizarre accident, June polishes up the prose and sells the book as her own without crediting her friend.Most of the book is just internal angst about Twitter.Maybe I am not the key demographic for this book (I'm in the over 35 crowd), but how I approach social media is like Marie Kondo - if it doesn't spark joy, I get rid of it. If people spew hate, I just block them.So I don't really feel like we were making progress in this novel because I would not have given any credence to these naysayers.There is some commentary on the book community. Some of it was interesting.I will clarify a few things.If you write a negative review, you are not supposed to tag the author.While the internet may seem like The Wild West, GoodReads does have Community Guidelines. They state, ""Criticizing the opinions of others is permitted, but attacking individuals for their opinions is not.""Personally, I have never had a problem with an author, publisher, or GoodReads so you can write negative reviews (just make sure not to violate the Community Guidelines).This book does bring up some interesting points around who gets to tell certain stories and plagiarism.I found this issue of plagiarism particularly ironic because Yellowface didn't strike me as very original, essentially a mashup ofThe Plot by Jean Hanoff KorelitzandThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L Frank Baum. Furthermore, RF Kuang had a scene inThe Poppy War (published 2018)where the main character was training by carrying a pig up a mountain.Well, there is a story inHoles (published 1998)by Louis Sachar where someone carries a pig up a mountain.However, people create retellings all the time. There are lots of familiar and time-tested tropes and plots. At what point is it plagiarism? This would have been a great book for a book club.Overall, this was an average book, definitely not the riveting book, have to read in one sitting book that the world has lost its mind over.Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",3
968,Yellowface,"Goodreads Choice Awards Winner - Best FictionGoodreads Choice Awards Final Round - Best FictionGoodreads Choice Awards Opening Round - Best FictionAAPI MonthWhat does colonialism do to a person? As a non-white person growing up in the States, and disliking it, what made me so interested in the UK as a child? Even now? And even more importantly, as a Vietnamese American, what made me so interested in France? And more so in recent years, China and Japan? It's a hard introspective look, to be sure.This book takesBabeland continues to flip the script. June Hayward, a white American woman struggling to become an author, is frenemies with Athena Liu, publishing darling. June continues to state time and time again that Athena is only famous because she is a minority. How many times have we heard this?June is with Athena when she chokes to death. I implied she maybe had something to do with her death. June is a very unreliable narrator. Do with that what you will. Anyway, Athena has a manuscript that she has begun. June steals, edits, and publishes it. June's new publishers think her name is too white (because sheiswhite), and rebrand her Juniper Song. Ambiguous. As ambiguous as ScarJo's Japaneseness. And Emma Stone's Vietnameseness.June is asked to speak on panels, go to book clubs, and mentor student writers. When the aforementioned people learn she is not Chinese, heads begin to roll. June does not take this in stride. She thinks she is entitled to write Chinese stories, because she ""did research."" Do we remember theAmerican Dirtdebacle? I do. I won't touch that book with a ten foot pole. It's not a matter of who can tell what stories. (Well, it is, but no matter.) It's that a white woman received a seven figure advance telling the trauma stories of a marginalized group that will never see a cent of that. Where are the stories from actual undocumented immigrants? No one in any famous book club will ever read those.",5
969,Yellowface,"EDIT:This videosums up my thoughts. I thought it was very inappropriate how the author used an objectively bitchy and untrustworthy narrator as a mouthpiece for all of the REAL LIFE criticisms that the actual author has received in real life. By doing this, all of the critiques seem like they come from people who are just jealous and have no valid arguments against her self-insert martyr author character Athena (who mirrors the real life author in many, MANY ways). I read this book one year before it was actually published, so there might have been changes, but from this video and other reviews I've seen, not much is different from when I first read it.I will be honest up front: this review is entirely plagiarized.Was I not meant to admit that? Should I have, instead, gone on long, rambling, and yet tersely flat paragraphs about how ironic it is that I am negatively critiquing a book about plagiarism by using the same points as everyone else? Should I call this satire—granted that there is nothing humorous and that I am not particularly strongly exaggerating anything—as I amateurly write prose so unabashedly written in my own voice that it would be impossible to separate any idea from my own? Because that appears to be the direction this book has gone in.I am not the first to say that this reads like RFK's notes app consciousness, nor will I be the last. While I will not get into specifics, as this is an incredibly early copy of the book, I will say that anyone who even remotely knows anything about the author will see the similarities between them and...certain things. Now, I have no issue with an author writing from experience.'Write what you know'is both an incredibly popular and successful piece of advice given to wannabee-writers. Butfuck,at some point one has to wonder about the motivation behind it.Simply put, because there is no other way to put it, this book felt like a circle-jerk. I should have expected such a thing from a satire on the publishing industry written by a prominent figure within it. It is typical—of course they will ridicule things like social media and how the masses view them. Of course they will glower at criticisms and mock fellow authors. Is that not the purpose of satire? But this feels like so much more than that. Instead, I feel as if RFK is speaking to me in a jest. Like she is pointing toward the book community, head cocked to the side, cheekily winking in our shared knowledge of their ridiculousness. Her eyes say,look at them—look at their silliness and their worries and their jealousy. See how they behave like animals, that group of people outside of our circle.Like she'll laugh right after, content in her knowledge that she lives in an absurd space, and that only we understand its absurdity.My first tip-off—no, not my first, though perhaps the most obscene—is how she uses our untrustworthy protagonist. RFK is, without a doubt, excellent at writing bad people. I have never argued against this, and I rather think I never will. But in this way, I feel almost uncomfortable when her unlikable characters serve the role of real people. She mocks criticism she has received in the past for her very real, non-fictitious books, through these characters. It feels, once again, like a terrible inside joke I have been privy to. As if the reader is meant to read these and think,these ridiculous characters! To say such things as this!And yet when one is aware of the author's actual past, it becomes...awkward. That is, she is not an author of subtlety. The satire could not work because it was not sufficiently...anything! I did not find it funny, nor was it so exaggerated as to be comical.The writing in general did not work for me.Babel,for all of its long-winded sentences and unending paragraphs of description, felt like a declaration of loyalty to words. This book, instead, felt like it was made by someone who could not care less for such things. This is, I understand, literary fiction. RFK has gone out of her normal bubble of fantasy to try something new, and I truly commend her for it. But I must question if this is the right genre for her. She is blunt and uncouth, neither of which are particularly bad—nor do I even dislike it—but which are painfully obvious throughout this. I felt like I was reading one of those High School creative writing class exercises (something which I actually do on a daily basis) where the young, inexperienced creator feels the need to say things like ""but you'll never guess what happens next"" and ""this is something that'll come up later"" in their first point of view narrative as if the reader is not skillful enough to gradually realize such things later on. Its modernist setting equally paid a part in this. There are only so many times you can name-drop an author or celebrity or, God-be-damned, fucking Harry Potter before realizing you have written something that reads like a Buzzfeed quiz. No, the narration did not work for me, nor did I think that any of it ultimately paid off in its strange and wholly random ending I can only describe as, ""really?""I struggle to find the words to end this. I'm afraid I have run out of other people's thoughts to steal as I reword them into my own. I want to clarify that I do like the author's other works. Out of the five books of hers I've read (all of her works except for that one anthology she worked on), I've really liked and sometimes loved three of them. But that doesn't mean I'm not capable of thinking that this was not her best genre, nor her best work by any means. This book felt like the worst possible self-awareness. The type shared over grins and knowing smiles, wherein both parties are partaking in the mockery of a group of people they think themselves entirely separated from. This is a book that both ridicules authors while falling to its knees, proclaiming its undying devotion to them. Funny enough, I praisedBabelfor a much similar sentiment. But where in that book I enjoyed the constant switch between criticizing the power and history of words to being mesmerized over them,Yellowfacefelt more like a sledgehammer.Love me,it sayslike I love you—all of us—the sophisticated and knowledgeable professionals. Those of us who do not care for the social media mob, for we are above it. Those of us willfully scornful of such things, for if we pretend to each other long enough that we are all on the same page against the absurdist, laughable masses, we might start to believe it.arc received for an honest review",2
970,Yellowface,"I'M CRYING, THROWING UP, RIPPING MY HAIR OUT AND THEN CRYING SOME MORE!Rebecca F. Kuang is THE WRITER of our generation.The author, honestly just like with Babel, had me in the palm of her hand from page 1. And my attention lasted until the very last page. I spent every waking hour thinking about this book, while I was reading it and while I was NOT. I cannot possibly imagine something this good can be written, but it turns out it can, I'm witnessing the magic happen, right?I'm not that hard to please when it comes to my reading, and I give five star ratings (fairly) easily. But it doesn't happen every day that I GO MAD loving a book. That fact speaks for itself.R. F. Kuang doesn't speak with or to you when she writes, she HAUNTS you. It takes a genius to achieve that.She explored every possible aspect or every question you might have, every side you could possibly take on this subject, doesn't leave much room for the reviewer, but I'm not complaining (I like my thoughts planted)PLOT The blurb is short and easy to understand, so i don't feel the need to retell it once more (I know I would do a poor job). I saw that most reviews on here surrounded the issues of the publishing industry as the central theme of this book, but I wouldn't agree. Just like with Babel, the racial debate takes the biggest piece of the cake, just dressed in different icing. But again, I'm not complaining. The book community is rarely not problematic, let's be honest, we are witnessing whitewashing and white supremacy on here every day. So, to not be blind and ignorant, we should learn about the topic EVERY DAY. As a white woman, I wasn't offended with any of the thoughts from this book, and I quite frankly think, that hating it (the story it explores) is an act of racism.BABEL Yeah, it's not one of those 'if you like this you'll like that' situations. This book is different in every aspect, if I hadn't known I wouldn't think it was written by the same person. BUT IT'S EQUALLY AS BRILLIANT. Doesn't that really picture the talent and originality of this writer?CHARACTERS I'm quite possibly the biggest fan of morally ambiguous characters. Especially when they're well written, they amaze and intrigue me. Life is far from black and white, right? I feel like the author inserted bits and pieces of herself in each of the characters, I don't feel like she chose just one. Both are writers and artists, both flawed (chronically unoriginal), but both for sure do have redeeming qualities.Sounds a bit fake, but I genuinely think R. F. Kuang was the right person to tell this story. No matter how many times she REINVENTS herself, the story always feels like it was made just and only for her. I can't wait to read the Poppy War trilogy.In the end, the intended question remains:Would it be the same if a white woman wrote this?💕📖💕(What i wrote before reading)This will make me or break me (I'm so serious)",5
971,Yellowface,"”Who has the right to write about suffering?”Have you ever read a book that is so timely and effective in its message that you do not feel the slightest bit qualified to review it? That your thoughts on such a masterpiece are not even worthy of being put to paper, literally or figuratively, because they are trite, vapid, and banal in comparison to the quality of the text being discussed? That’s how I feel trying to put the proverbial pen to paper with my thoughts onYellowface.Is this book satire? Obviously and not quite so much. What I mean is, it’s clearly satire, but to an extent that these characters are not exact flesh and blood, but the issues discussed in this book are far from farcical. Most reviewers have noticed the central themes inYellowfacerearing their ugly head in the real world, especially in the past few years, so it is refreshing and exhilarating to read a fictional novel encompassing these issues in a way that onlyR.F. Kuangcould create.”Give me your bruises and hurts, she told us, and I will return to you a diamond.”Let’s be clear: June is not a character that you will feel empathy for. She will not be redeemed, rooted for, or endeared by the end; however, watching her downfall is oddly satisfying in a way that I cannot quite explain. The insight into the process of releasing a book with a Big Five publisher is compelling and intriguing, and it’s, sadly, easy to see how something like this story could transpire. The beauty of this tale is no one is safe from criticism; Kuang makes it clear that there are various forms of privilege that transpire across lines of race, class, gender, etc., and every single character really has something to answer for.In one word:Brilliant.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.",5
972,Yellowface,"I give this book four stars because, one, it’s highly entertaining. For maybe the first fifty pages or so the writing felt a bit dry, though when the plot picks up, I found myself so curious to know: will this white woman who stole an Asian American woman’s work get caught?? Will she confront her own insecurities that led to this? Is Athena actually dead?? R.F. Kuang creates a selfish, self-absorbed main character in June Hayward, with a consistent voice that kept me engaged inYellowface’s story.I also think this book does open up important conversations. Yes, at times it makes its point bluntly/crudely and in an obvious way, though through this satire Kuang raises deeper questions too, such as whether anyone can remain truly ethical or generous in a brutally capitalist publishing industry. I liked how Kuang didn’t make Athena a perfect character because by doing so, she highlights how people of color can engage in problematic and oppressive practices too.So even though I didn’t agree with all of Kuang’s satirical commentary inYellowface(e.g., I think Asian Americans should be asked hard, critical questions about glorifying whiteness both in dating partners and in other areas of life), I respect that she seized a popular topic in the publishing industry and made a novel out of it. The exaggerated nature of satire doesn’t always lend itself to a deeper emotional connection with the characters or the story, though I don’t think a deep emotional connection is necessarily the point of this novel. Overall, while I don’t see this novel breaking into my top ten list at the end of this year, I found it an interesting read and one that may be fun to discuss.*also, just to add, this type of thing is still happening all the time, including in other industries. Recently I saw a white woman publish a research paper on Black and Latinx mothers and when I emailed her and asked about her research practices with these communities, she literally just ignored me. And, as I've written about in at least one other review, one time I gently called in a white woman for doing her dissertation on Asian American women (with no Asian American women as coauthors) and she called me aggressive and ""untrusting."" sigh!",4
973,Yellowface,"Yellowface by RF Kuang was fast-paced, satirical, intriguing, and unique!I've never heard of or read a book with a similar concept, which I found so refreshing. June's internal monologue was absolutely insane, especially in the first half. I didn't even know how she could dig herself deeper into the hole, but she never failed to dig herself deeper and deeper. I was left with my jaw dropped at the end of multiple chapters.I really enjoyed the insight into the publishing industry that Yellowface gave as well. One of the sentences that struck me the most was ""Bestsellers are chosen. Nothing you do matters"". I assumed this was often the case, however, it opened my eyes to how much ads and promotions for certain books impact the chance of me reading them.Overall I had such a fun time buddy reading Yellowface withSue!I've heard incredible things about RF Kuang for years, so I am very happy to finally have picked up one of her books. needless to say, I'll be reading her entire backlist!",5
974,Yellowface,"Madelein L'Engle said, ""You have to write the book that wants to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children."" If Rebbeca Kuang saw this quote, she must have mixed it up because she wrote this book as though it's meant for children who want to graduate to adult fiction.Yellowface is an unsubtle, hammer-to-the-forehead quasi-treatise about the dangers of White Women. Those villainised hacks who never see how what they're doing is wrong. They're Karens, but they voted for Biden. No really, June Hayward says she is a Democrat, and liberal, and voted for Biden multiple times within the book. Hayward a mediocre author who is friends (and we're not really convinced why) with a Chinese American literary star Athena Liu who dies suddenly after a pancake goes down the wrong hole, and Hayward is too inept to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre.After this, Hayward steals Liu's manuscript about Chinese laborers forcefully conscripted by the French during World War 1. The caucasity is unsurprising, trite, and racist covering all the beats we experienced every time we covered Discourse about films like The Blindside, Hidden Figures Greenbook, and books like The Help, or American Dirt.This book is not funny, it's not particularly well-written, with a literal typo in the first few pagesThe editor who did got fired,. The narrative is repetitive and disjointed, like puzzle pieces forced together from different boxes. There were scenes where June's narration is simply exhausting.I have to remind Athena this every single time. She has a goldfish’s memory when it comes to my problems—it takes two or three repetitions for anything to stick.First of all, Rebecca, goldfish don't have short memories. Some can keep them for years. Secondly, you already said this multiple times. We aren't ""goldfish"", we aren't sieves. We don't need incessant spoonfeeding about something you already said. In the opening stints, June mentions how her debut was left to languish by her editor at the pathetic imprint that was the only one that gave her a chance. It didn't need to be repeated. It also speaks to a certain lack of, perhaps, awareness by Rebecca about how publishing classifies books. When they acquire a manuscript, the books are then delineated, and different budgets are assigned to the books based on what they think will be most profitable. In the current environment, poorly written horny romantasy, AI and climate change scare stories, American POC history and struggle porn, badly written romance, and whatever book Booktok bestows its benevolent virality are the ones most likely to get publishing buzz.Majority of the authors are very white, very North American, or very British. June's lack of awareness of how publishing works spoke more to Rebecca's ignorance or laziness. And ultimately, her scapegoating of publishing ""wanting diverse stories"" rings hollow. Maybe this story would have been better if June had whitewashed a literary navel-gazing story about vulnerability and identity.Beyond the amateurish prose that suffered from sudden bursts of Thesaurus-itis, for example, on Pg. 6 Rebecca writes,It’s so fucking arbitrary. Or perhaps not arbitrary, but it hinges on factors that have nothing to do with the strength of one’s prose.then on Pg. 102Can't we all get behind decrying antimiscegenation?June also says Athena's prose is repetitive while her monologues feel like a scratched CD. One could argue that Rebecca is trying to show how June is unaware of her lack of talent but you can't help but wonder if she is just a serviceable writer. The book takes pains to be accessible for mass audiences. Rebecca also wants to explain every little detail such as ARCs and sensitivity readers-jargon everyone who is involved in The Community would know. June even goes on a diatribe when discussing a potential movie deal and says,Accessibility matters.and when undressing the stolen manuscript that's ""difficult"" to read, she says,It’s distracting from the central narrative. Reading should be an enjoyable experience, not a chore.Is this satire or Rebecca explaining why the prose is so bland and repetitive.My suspension of disbelief was unwilling and abused by how ridiculous some of the events in publishing happen. When June mentions the Goodreads Choice Awards more times than more prestigious ones, I couldn't help but wonder if Rebecca doesn't understand literary Oscars season or if she was trying to pander to Goodreads Choice Awards voters (this book will definitely be listed under Best Fiction). The GCAs are a popularity contest. Rarely do people read all the books listed, they only vote for what they loved. Additionally, no discerning reader who wants a book about Chinese labourers in WW1 would give a fuck about GCAs.Or is this a 4D chess Trojan horse where readers are actually being unwittingly tested as a focus group? Some people will prefer a female friendship story where race dynamics are explored (The Hate U Give), or perhaps they will want a thriller involving authors and books (Too Close To Home by Linwood Barclay), a meta narrative about who gets to tell a story (Bad Art Friend), a serial plagiariser (look up Jumi Bello), or Asian American nonfiction (Minor Feelings) and Rebecca can pick her next project. Maybe Rebecca is staging herself as the host of the round table to discuss whether authors should interact with reviews. But as we saw with Lauren Hough, the answer is still no.There was also a glaring pattern where June kept pointing out Athena's flaws. How she was once the actual bad art friend, how Twitter Hot Take enthusiasts called her a race traitor. But we never get to delve into that because June believesno one is that deep into Chinese history or politics. Great job, Rebecca. You have shut down your critics for the lack of nuance in Asian history and characters in Babel. Athena is so offensively superficially written that I almost wished we had gotten her point of view, as a villain who wants to step on all faces to the top of the literary throne. The few snippets we get of her prose show she's a much better writer than June and her narration would have been more palatable than June's weapons of mass boredom.There's a certain Discourse we're supposed to have from this book about Bad White Women, and how publishing serves to silence writers of colour. We also have to discuss who gets to tell certain stories. The problem is, we have spoken about this ad nauseum. So who is this book for? Outsiders who would like to know how it works? Adults who wanted a meta vivisection of this insular world but with Dark Themes?Rebecca doesn't know. She says it's a thriller examining the idiosyncracies of publishing. It's not thrilling. And it has a myopic view of how publishing works. About good intentions that went poorly when June always set out to usurp Athena's work from the jump? It's not satire. It's a reverse Künstlerroman. Why is it necessary? The book doesn't tell you because it ends like a flaccid plateau. Not only is it boring, but it's just a meme of a clueless White Woman.",1

976,Yellowface,"Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokUPDATE: after a Shower Thought™, I was inspired to make a video about the symbolism of food in this book and how I interpreted it to be a physical manifestation of the main character's rejection of the culture she was metaphorically trying to devour:https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8PN381N/I'm not the biggest fan of R.F. Kuang's work but I wassodrawn into the premise of YELLOWFACE, which asks the question, ""What would happen if a white woman literally stole an Asian woman's work and then published it as her own and sort of got away with it (maybe)?"" It's a daring and troubling question that splits open the way the publishing industry works (and doesn't work), while also showing the desperation and bottomless need for approval that some authors feel while milling away in an industry that moves at a pace far faster than most authors are capable of writing at.June Hayward is an interesting character. She's racist (but doesn't think she is), privileged (again), and incredibly narcissistic, but in her story, she is the tragic heroine fighting against the odds. I think it's always a challenge writing an unlikable character who still feels chillingly human and relatable, and reading YELLOWFACE actually gave me the same high I felt while watchingHouse of Usher. There's something very Faustian and self-damning about June that feels like it could have come right out of a story by Poe.I liked the ending but it wasn't quite the ending I was hoping for. I think it fits, though. And I think the discussions around this novel, because of the subject matter and also because of who wrote it, are interesting. The writing style is so beautiful and it's clear how much Kuang has grown from THE POPPY WAR, which also had a female antiheroine championing An Agenda. Unlike TPW, however, this feels like a very nuanced work.4.5 to 5 stars",5

978,Yellowface,"Yet again I'm here to disagree with the masses.....I can't do it. I can't spend another minute with this whiney, pretentious, self-aggrandizing, and horrid main character anymore.

980,Yellowface,"I usually roll my eyes when people call a book “compulsively readable”, but in this case, I get it.For lack of a less cliched comparison, this book was like a slow motion car wreck you just can’t look away from.June Hayward only has one other author friend: Athena Liu, a young, successful, Chinese American author who’s found all the success in literature that June can only dream of. Then one day, while celebrating Athena’s upcoming Netflix deal, she chokes to death right in front of her. June is left with her only friend’s corpse and the first draft of Athena’s latest manuscript, which no one but her knows about.So she steals the manuscript and makes it her own.The ensuing story is told in such an unreliable, insidious way that it creeps under your skin. What’s so scary is that it’s 100% believable. You can follow June’s descent into worse and worse offenses (though she started out pretty damn bad), while at every step the reader is trapped in her head as she justifies why she is the one in the right, the victim.I hated June so, so much. That’s what made this compulsively readable to me. She spent so much of the novel fucking around—I needed to stick around to see her find out.So, this was absolutely brilliant social commentary on the publishing industry and the path from performative ally to full-on Karen, while at the same time telling a smart and gripping story in its own right.",5
981,Yellowface,"RF Kuang is kinda insane and i love it. i really enjoyed this book from the beginning, i love that june was such an unlikeable character but in a realistic way. she was kinda unhinged and insane. this book really makes you think and the way it covers race is so genius. i love that ms rebecca does not shy away from talking about race in her books. babel may not have been a book that i loved but i can still acknowledge and appreciate it, i was worried when i didn’t enjoy that, that i might just need a break from this author but boy was i wrong omg. yellowface definitely makes up for babel. i kind of enjoyed the way that it feels like a thriller even though it obviously is not. it also read SO FAST!! i feel like i flew right through this book, i barely wanted to put it down because i was wondering where the story would go next. i like the social media in this book and seeing what publishing is like for authors because i’ve also been so curious. love the mention of reviewers and booktubers in this book. RF Kuang is such a genius my gosh. cant wait for more from this author.",4
982,Ugly Love,"1.75 stars✩⋆oops this is awkward. i know this is a beloved CoHo book and yes, i loved this back then when i first read it but rereading itnowi-don't look at me.my reading taste have changed oookay? i might have overlooked every shitty thing back then but now that i'm more petty, have the penchant for holding a grudge, and have high standards for books ooohh boy.✧what is this about?↳ okay so this is aboutMiles and Racheloops sorry, i meant Tate and Miles. Miles being Tate's brother's best friend and Tate being Miles'therapist, ugh sorry, i meant friends with benefits person and the whole time she was hoping he would change his mind because duh she's falling for him while Miles just implicitly leads her on even though he's clear about his rules and pushes her away the whole damn time because of his past but he won't stop their little arrangement because our mans ishorny as fuck.also,Miles is a pilot. this is an important fact. ALSO also, this isnotTate and Miles' story- this is Tate + Miles and Rachel's story.i read this years ago and the only things i remember is that Miles got horny while he was wearing swim shorts? (idfk why i remember this don't ask), Miles and Rachel's shower scene (again, idfk why i remember this but i wish i can unsee it thank you very much), and then the Nick Bateman trailer??anyways, that's all i remember and i know, they're all irrelevant but do you know what i forgot?? huh? do you? DO YOU??! well, if you've read this then you can probably guess what i didn't remember because HOLY SHIT- the scene at the end. guys... GUYS.What. The. Fuck.i was speechless-S-P-E-E-C-H-L-E-S-S. i canNOT believe i forgot that scene holy shit. the anger. the annoyance- the fuckingragethat i felt when i read that oh my god. anyways, i'm ranting again and y'all know the drill so,･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･SPOILERS AHEAD･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･．⤅dislike #1: Miles' povyou know what, i'm gonna be straight to the point:MILES SEEMED MORE IN LOVE WITH RACHEL. or at least he will never love anyone the way he loved Rachel because it wasthatintense. now, now. lemme explain.the problem is, almost all of Miles' pov in this book is about the past and most of these past chapters are of him falling so deeply and passionately in love with Rachel that he turns into fucking ✨s h a k e s p e a r e✨She doesn't realize she's everywhere She's in everything Everysingle thing hasjust become Rachel,It's consuming me.My thoughts aren't thoughts anymore.My thoughts are Rachel.I can't fall in love with you, Rachel.I look at the sink. I want to look at Rachel.I breathe in air. I want to breathe in Rachel.I close my eyes. I only see Rachel.I wash my hands. I want to touch Rachel.do y'all see this ⤴ ? this is the type of thing i wanted to see from Miles' pov when he's talking about TateNOTRachel but we never got to see this until the very end. and then when we get to the present chapters it's 98% in Tate's pov where we seeherfalling in love with Miles and this is annoying to me because seeing Miles treat Rachel like a goddess in his past chapters and then Miles being a little dickhead in Tate's chapters ugh-energy? notm a t c h e d.and with most of Miles' pov being in the past and falling in love with Rachel, obviously i couldn't help but compare and overanalyze every single thing and think he seems more in love with Rachel. and the thing that annoys me the most is that Tate's present pov and Miles' pov alternates so whenever we read Tate and Miles' romantic progression, the next chapter is Miles being so deeply in love with another woman, it's just...i could've done with justonepast Miles pov instead of making it every second chapter or making it 50% of the whole content and showing the way he fell in love sooOOoooOo deeply with Rachel instead of just having 1-2 chapters of his pov about Tate, who's theactual heroine of the book. it's just soblehand icky the whole timeshe felt like second bestfor me and i just felt bad. i know i've always complained about telling >>> showing in other books but this is the only time i'll ever accept all tell, no show.⤅dislike #2: i can't with the doormat behaviorwhat makes everything more annoying is how Tate just lets him use her for sex and forgives him way too easily all the damn time like bish NO make him work for it for once and stop being a doormat it's annoying (yes, i know i've said the word annoying one too many times but that's how i felt 99.9% of the book OK).“If any other man ever treated me like he did, it would be the one and only time. I don’t put up with the things I’ve seen a lot of my friends put up with. However, I find myself continuing to make excuses for him, like something could actually justify his actions last week.”ma'am pLS-the whole time i was just yelling at her,TATE, YOU ARE NOT HIS THERAPIST. ugh this pissed me off so much i couldn't even cheer for their romance because Miles was eh and honestly had no redeeming qualities in the present and then reading about his past pov being all in love with Rachel and in the present he just uses Tate for sex and pushes her away quite rudely all the damn time is,again, A-N-N-O-Y-I-N-G.⤅dislike #3: repetitive romanceno seriously. all they ever did was have sex, Tate hoping he would renege his rules and tell her that he does indeed love her and want a relationship with her, Miles pushing her away, Tate forgives him and then they fuck. repeat.⤅dislike #4: pain. just- P A I Nand then- AND THEN i was just reading Tate and Miles' repetitive interactions where i thought the same shit would happen again and again in peace but THEEENNN.........hold on, lemme just give y'all a moment to breathe.......are you ready? OK""My God, Rachel.""um excuse me-you're probably wondering,mel, did he really say his ex's name, his ex who we've been reading about in his past chapters and won't shut up about how much he loves this other woman, while having sex with Tate??well, i don't know let's look at the quote again shall we? are you guys ready?He pulls out, then thrusts inside me again, this time with all his strength.It hurts.Give me your pain, Miles.""MY GOD, RACHEL.""My God, Rachel...Rachel, Rachel, Rachelthere. did y'all see that? okay? good.now, not gonna lie with you guys, this oneHURT. when i read this scene i didn't know how to feel to be honest. was i shocked? appalled? speechless as fuck? all of the above?? yes. now with this scene, my annoyance reached its peak and is higher than the fucking stratosphere because why you ask? well, it's because there isNO GROVELING!! Tate leaves, Miles lets her go and says it's hard to feel bad for her because she's never felt real pain, then goes to Rachel for closure, goes to Tate and explains his pastvaguelyand all is forgiven???i'm pretty sure this is where my hatred forhero fucks up so bad but heroine forgives them after one speechtrope came from.now, some might say that he gets a pass because of his sad past- because it really was sad by the way - but you see, for the majority of the book we've been reading about how Miles fought for and loved Rachel, and Tate fought for and loved Miles, for once i wanted to see him fighting for Tate but we never got to see that because again, there isNO. GROVELING.───── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ─────i can't believe i rated this 5 stars back then. i don't know who pre 2019 mel is. we don't know her.honestly, because of the ending, i was this close to rating this 1 star because that's how annoyed i was with everyone but i felt generous today so. as always, i liked the emotional writing and how i can feel the longing and passion between Tate and Miles when they're having sex, the whole ""ugly love"" message, and learning about Miles' past and why he's the way he is?? it was so sad.but overall, everyone annoyed the f outta me (except for Cap- he's the best character in this book), this is basically Miles and Rachel's story, and the ending was unsatisfying as fuck.* * *original rating (july 2015)──5 stars",2
983,Ugly Love,"**** FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED ::: 6 STARS!!! ****Casting for Miles...Holy WOW!!! What abeautifulstory!!!It was absolute stunning perfection in every way. My heart is just overflowing with emotions ♥Starting withSlammedandPoint of Retreat, then withHopeless,Losing HopeandThis Girl, and once again withMaybe Someday, Colleen Hoover has proven over and over again that her stories are unique, powerful and incredibly well written. I have come to trust her writing implicitly. I love the passion she conveys in her words, the depths of the connections she establishes between her characters, and the effortlessly beautiful style in which writes her stories. Without a doubt, she is one of my favorite authors.Ugly Loveis beautiful, sexy, and heart-wrenching. It's powerful, compelling and emotionally charged with a unique storyline that was truly unlike any other I've read. For days after  I finished reading, my mind would drift back to Miles and Tate and relive moments of their story because I just couldn't let go.________________I fell in love with the story on page one. You might think that the first page is a little early to proclaim undying love for a book but I instantly feltconnected-- it was like I'd just stepped rightintothe story.We first meet Tate when she moves in with her brother for a fresh start where her path quite literally crosses with airline pilot Miles Archer as he lies passed out drunk outside her new place. Despite her initial judgment of his character, she quickly learned there a whole side of himself he was hiding from the world -- a deep, bottomless pit of pain and sadness.She wasn't looking for a relationship and he wanted nothing to do with love but they had an undeniably powerful attraction towards each other. Drawn together, but unwilling to give themselves wholly over, they agreed to a friends-with-benefits arrangement following Miles' two, unwavering rules that would forever keep a distance between them.“Don’t ask about my past,” he says firmly.  “And never expect a future.”The more time they spent together, the more complicated things became as the lines between friendship and love began to blur. As Tate began to give her heart over, Miles fell further away. The pain of his past was so great that he never again would allow himself to fall in love. Not for any reason, or for anyone.""It's not that I don't like you, Tate… I just don'twantto like you. I don't want to likeanyone. I don't want todateanyone. I don't want toloveanyone.""However even through the most painful and ugly times, there's a healing power to love. This story left me emotionally drained but on the most amazing book high you can imagine. It was a powerful journey that showed how even after the worst possible devastation, love can always find a way.________________Every single moment while reading this book, I wasfeelingsomething, and feeling it strongly. It was thrilling, mysterious, sexy, alluring, emotional, it waseverythingin the exact perfect balance. From the start, it was clear that we were not seeing the full picture so each scene gave us another piece of the puzzle that was Miles' past. Everything just made me want to knowmore.I couldn't turn the pages fast enough!Miles was such an intriguing character to try and figure out. Enigmatic. Mysterious. Smart. Sexy. Sensitive. His past so full of pain that it shut him away from wanting any hope for his future. Not only was he unable to move on, but he genuinely didn'twantto.... and he was willing to do everything in his power, to sacrificeanything, to never again have to experience so much pain. Seeing him struggle internally with both his aversion to love and his growing attachment to Tate was just heartbreaking. His pain felt sorealthat I can honestly say, I've never wanted to hug a fictional character this much before.""Tate,"" He says in a pained whisper. His face moves to my neck, and one of his hands grips my waist... His other hand moves to the back of my head as his lips rest against the skin of my neck. ""What do I do?"" He whispers. ""What the fuck do I do?""We were shown the story through both Miles and Tate's POVs in a mix of both present day storylines and flashbacks. The present was told from Tate's perspective and, because of how mysterious Miles was, we got to see flashbacks from his POV six years earlier. And as these little pieces of his past slowly began to line up with his behaviour in the present, I was able to begin putting together the real story he was hiding.He kept so much hidden that all the little things between them -- the hint of a smile, the stroke of a thumb, a quick glance -- becamesomuch more powerful and meaningful. And because of the build up of all these little moments, when Miles and Tate finally got together it was explosive!Dear long-time CoHo fans, be prepared forhotness!!!!!  This is a whole new side to Colleen Hoover's writing and let me tell you, it issexyandsteamy!!!Trust me, you will be fanning yourself ;)""The couch or your bed?"" he whispers.""Both,"" I reply.But on a more serious note.... The more I read, the closer I got to discovering the source of Miles' pain and when it hit, it wasgut-wrenching!!! I can honestly say that few character's backstories haveevermade my heart shatter as Miles' did.I cried -- no,sobbed --so much that I could no longer see the words and so I just sat there with tears steaming down my face absorbing the huge emotions this story evoked.""If I were capable of loving someone… it would be you.""I want to promise you though that this story is worth every tear because the way all the pieces of the story come together was absolutely gorgeous. The ending will leave you with a joyous feeling but the journey to get there is not an easy one. It's beautiful but so broken.Ugly love.________________I've read the book twice now and I know I'll be reading it many more times to come. I have the book hangover of the century and I'm finding it hard to let go of Miles and Tate because of how strongly I connected to them. Truly, I don't think there can be greater proof that this was awonderfulbook.I've loved every book Colleen Hoover has written butthisone is my favorite.Ugly Loveis a must-read book of the year! I loved every word, I felt every moment, and I will never forget this story.I don't give out a lot of 6 star ratings (in fact this will be the first one I've given this year) but the truth is that this book went above and beyond. The story was powerful, the writing was stunning, and the way every single piece of it was woven together was simply breathtaking.Rating: 6 STARS!! Standalone romance.And... I still want to hug Miles ♥Release date: August 5, 2014._____________________________________For more of my reviews, book news and updates:✦Main blog: Aestas Book Blog✦Facebook Blog Page✦Twitter",5
984,Ugly Love,"HOLY CRAP ON A CRACKER!!!! MY HEART IS SO PERFECTLY BROKEN! I DON'T THINK I TOOK A BREATH THE WHOLE TIME I READ THIS BOOK! WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME COLLEEN HOOVER!!! I HATE YOU BUT I LOVE YOU! YOU RUINED ME AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH!IF YOU CAN'T GUESS IT BY MY NON STOP CAPS THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO THAN SCREAM ""I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!""WOW JUST WOW! I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHEN I'LL GET OVER THIS BOOK HANGOVER.Ugly Lovewas nothing like I expected it to be. I excepted it too be like a50 Shades of Greyfan fiction with just a butt ton of thrown together steamy scenes... No, it wasn't it was so much more. I knew I was going to like Miles (because he sounded so hot), but I had no idea that I was going to love him. That he was going to have an actual back story... That he was going to be actually interesting in a realistic way... I had no idea he was going to break my heart.All that being said I have a few bookish confessions to make before I really get into the review, I choose to read this book 1) because I heard it was becoming a movie and if there's anything I love nearly as much as reading it's seeing movies 2) because this is who they have playing Miles:Yeah I didn't notice the dog at first either...and 3) I also need to admit that I didn't get what was so appealing about this book that it was actually going to become a movie... I get it now. I get all the hype and talk surrounding this book. I haveNEVER, EVER, EVERcried so hard in a book. That's the very last thing I thought this book was going to make me do.The characters in this book felt so real. Tate was naive and normally that would make me wanna punch a B, in her case it made me love her. Unlike most leading ladies she isn't overly sassy, or has incredible lol rebuttals,she was realistic. Her brother Corbin, OMG CORBIN, I loved every single thing about him. He has to be one of my favorite sub characters ever. He was what I imagined a brother would be and even with him not being a constant character just his presence had me. Then there's Miles and he is hands-down the star of this book. The moment you meet him you hate him. He is a mysterious mess and I thought he was going to annoy me fast. He won me over once they started going into his back story. The further they went into it the more I could feel what was coming...Yes, I knew where this story was going and what was going to happen but in no way, shape, or form was I actually prepared for it. I was a blubbering weeping ball of emotions.The switch between time and POVs was done flawlessly and revealed the perfect information at the perfect time to keep you hooked and wanting more. Colleen set up this story so at first you would only like Miles because of his looks (which I've already made clear I was guilty of)...""his shirt isn't buttoned. I'm staring at his stomach. Oh my word he has the V. Those beautiful indentations on men that run the length of their outer abdominal muscles, disappearing beneath their jeans as if the indentations are pointing to a secret bull's-eye.""And yes, he is a looker, but by the end I could have cared less about what he looked like. He could have worn a bag over his head for the last half of the book and my heart would have still been his. The relationship between Tate and Miles is like nothing I have read before. It was something else that really surprised me about this book. Saying it was complicated would be an understatement. I thought that the steamy scenes were going to take up most of this book, but it didn't... Yeah that's something that would normally make me rank a book lower, but the scenes were so well written and again realistic. They were well placed and well thought out. Just enough to make this book not ""too much"" which is what had me falling hard for this read way harder than I anticipated.The scenes are hot though like dump a bucket of water on your head hot.Miles and Tate's conversations roll so smoothly and the moments between them are so; I don't even know a word for them, they're just perfect (that word really doesn't do justice). Not only is he romantic but he made average things so hot.Orange juice is hot, rugs are hot, scrubs are hot, and curtains are so so hot.whoosh.Honestly though the scenes that turned out to be my favorite were just ""average scenes"", like when they all go and visit Tate and Corbin's family for Thanksgiving. That whole section had to of been my favorite. I loved how I thought this story was going to be Tate's but turned out to be Miles'. I love how I thought this book was going to be a light sexy read but turned out to be a heartbreaking love story. I just loved how everything came together while falling apart.. Because when all Miles story is finally shown and is laid out in it's fullest I was basically like this...I want to rant and rave even more about this book, but this is something you really need to read and experience for yourself.Ugly Lovemight just be the biggest surprise read I've had all year. I can't express enough how impressive the characters, plot, and play out of this story are.I didn't think that this book was going to be so hard on me... And yes,it hurt. And yes, it was a total sobbing fest, but that ending... Good golly miss molly.. That ending was perfection.I don't know if I can ever forgive Colleen Hoover for what she did to me, but God dang it I love her so much for it. I didn't see this coming and I've never been so happy to be emotionally slapped in the face like I was reading this.",5
985,Ugly Love,"If you're a fan of the book, please don't read this review. It's going to upset you, and then you're going to hate me and leave mean comments, and then we can't be friends anymore. It'll be awkward all around. So yeah, best avoid.Seriously, last chance to turn away.Okay, now that I'm among like-minded readers (all three of us who didn't like this book), what the heck was this? Was Colleen Hoover blackmailed into putting her name on a book written by a hormonal teenager? Because I can't comprehend any other explanation for the hot mess that was this book.Gosh, where to even start? How about with Tate and Miles, our main couple. So they meet and it's lust at first sight. But Miles can't do relationships because some unexplained thing has hurt him in the past. So now he can only have no-strings-attached sex. (Cue eye roll.) Of course, Tate can't say no to such an amazing offer, so she jumps right in. (Another eye roll.)Sure, the premise is a bit wack, but not all hope is lost. The characters must at least be likable, right? Well, no. Miles doesn't talk or smile, which is mentioned at least once on every single page. In fact, he smiles so rarely that Tate composed a poem on the one occasion he did:Miles smilesFor no one elseMiles only smilesFor me.If you're wondering how anyone could possibly fall for a nonverbal, expressionless man-child, your guess is as good as mine.Then we come to Tate, the world's biggest pushover, letting Miles walk all over her and treat her like a sex doormat. Yet she keeps going back for more, reeking of desperation and utterly devoid of self-respect. Lest you think this makes for an exciting story, I assure you there's a reason why silent/clingy has not taken off as a popular romance trope.I want to plaster those four words on a billboard and require myself to pass it on my drive to work every day.You'd think he promised her the moon and the stars, but no, he just said, ""You look pretty, Tate."" I kid you not.We also have interweaved the story from Miles's younger years, the one that explains his pain. He and Rachel are young and in love, but things keep getting in their way. It definitely makes for very angsty (shudder) drama. But that isn't my biggest issue. My biggest problem is that it's written like this:Rachel is happy.I make Rachel happy.I make Rachel's life better.Her life is better with me in it.""Rachel,"" I whisper.Is this a joke? And here's another example:We go to the beach.Rachel wants to sunbathe while she reads.I want to watch Rachel sunbathe while she reads.In case you think I cherrypicked the most ludicrous examples, those are actually from the same page. In fact, every page written about Miles and Rachel reads like this. And it has the most ridiculous formatting, with line breaks galore, everything center-aligned, and random italics thrown in for emphasis.Why is the writing so juvenile when Miles is supposedly 18 years old? Why is every scene between the two couples so cringeworthy? And why isn't this book called ""Idiot Love"" instead? I don't have any answers, just questions.As I was reading this, I kept feeling like I was on some hidden camera show, and any moment, someone would jump out of the bushes and yell, ""Gotcha!"" Then they would hand me the real book written by Colleen Hoover, and we'd all have a good laugh over how thoroughly they got me. But sadly, that didn't happen.I have a love/hate relationship with Colleen Hoover, and this one unfortunately falls squarely in the hate category. Since I've read most of her recent books, I thought I'd catch up on some of her older ones. But that was clearly the wrong decision. Maybe she's one of those authors who gets better and better as they go, and this is just too far back from her current style to resemble even a little of what I love about her writing.And one last closing thought: if you're a young woman (or young man) reading this, and you think this is the way love is supposed to be, just no. You can have spark and sizzle and lust, and still be treated with kindness and respect. Don't ever let someone walk all over you and don't ever settle for less than you deserve. Tate should've kicked Miles to the curb a long time ago. If she had, this would've been a story worth reading.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Ends with Us/It Starts with UsVerityReminders of HimRegretting YouLayla~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧",1
986,Ugly Love,"2 stars!First, I really have to thank my good friend Geri for buddy reading this with me or I would’ve taken a screwdriver to my eye long before I finished this book. I honestly havenothingpositive to say about this book so I’m going to put all my complaining in a spoiler tag so I don’t purposely hurt anyone who loved it.Usually when I read CoHo books, I am instantly hooked and transported into whatever world she’s created. I love that about her writing and very few authors can accomplish that feat again and again. However, it’s not a good sign when I’m only10% into this book and I feel ranty and restless.Here’s why:I.Did.Not.Appreciate.Or.Like.This.Kind.Of.Writing.That.CoHo.Used.Nearly all of Miles’s POV chapters were styled this way and quite frankly, I don’t get why. Is there some poetic, swishy-swashy, twirly message I’m supposed to get? I understand that for some sentences to be broken up like the way it is above can convey emphasis and I’m all for that, but it’s overkill to repeatedly use the same writing tactic. Reading shouldn’t be a chore, and it’sneverbeen a chore to read CoHo’s books but for this one, it was.My main problems with the book, however, are the main characters: Tate and Miles. To put it bluntly,I.Did.Not.Care.About.Either.Characters.TateSome may find Tate’s actions to be realistic and appropriate considering her situation, but her lack of self-respect was just disgraceful to read about. I don’t care if it’s all in the name of love. Miles didn’t even love her for most of the book until he “came to his senses” and she lets him walk all over her. Additionally, her relationship with Miles reminded me of a child trying to please an adult.“He just admitted that he wants to have sex with me; he just doesn’t want it to lead to anything. I don’t know why this flatters me. It should make me want to punch him, but the fact that he chose to kiss me after not having kissed anyone for six straight years makes this new confession seem like I just won a Pulitzer.”“Say the word ox.(Miles says the word ox)I smile. I love the word ox. It’s my new favorite word.”Essentially, everything Miles says is beautiful and noteworthy. *gag* And quite frankly, Ireallydon’t see how Tate falls in love with him when she doesn’t know anything about him. Except that he’s dark, broody, and silent most of the time. Oh and did I forget hot?  insert sarcasmMilesI read some early reviews so I was dying to know about his past and why he couldn’t love another but when I found out, I was severely underwhelmed...I mean, seriously??????Part.Of.The.REASONIs.Because.It’s.REVEALEDIn.This.Manner.I’m not a cold fish if that’s what you’re wondering and I have bawled like a baby before while reading heartbreaking book scenes, but this reveal did nothing for my emotions. All I felt was a sense of urgency to quickly finish the book and get it over with. Oh andMiles visiting Rachel to “confront his past?” That was so LAME! Basically, if Rachel wasn’t living happily with a new family, Miles wouldn’t have been able to move on. Guess it was soooooo convenient that she was able to move on which made Miles feel free to love Tate. BULLSHIT!I’m not even going to bother going in-depth with all the times he’s hurt Tate and callously brushed her aside but the one scene that made me hate both characters wasduring sex, Miles calls out his ex-girlfriend’s name and Tate just tells him to finish. WTF.In hindsight, I think this wouldn’t have been a big deal but from the beginning, the annoyances have been building up and that scene was the last straw.So a recap:Hated both MCs, Tate and Miles.Hated the writing style.Hated the unoriginal premise of the story (friends-with-benefits).Hated the clichés scattered throughout the story.This is why I havenothingpositive to say about this book.Well, I like the cover. Does that count?Everything this woman has written, I have enjoyed reading but it’s too bad that this time, CoHo wasn’t able to win over my emotions. Out of author loyalty and because she wrote the Slammed series (one of my top favorites), I’m going to give it 2 stars when I really want to smack one star on this book.",2
987,Ugly Love,"2-UGLY–StarsI know most of my GR friends–in fact, most everyone–loved this book, so please don't throw rotten tomatoes at me. I wish I could say I loved it, too, but I can't.When I read a romance, I need toFEELsome semblance of that romance. I need toLIKEat leastONEof the characters. If that's not possible, I need to be able toat leastSYMPATHIZEwith one them. Unfortunately, I never once felt the romance, and I could neither like nor sympathize with either one of the characters.As this story progressed, I found it impossible to like the hero or the heroine when I felt neither one of them deserved respect or admiration. The hero, Miles, treated the heroine, Tate, with such blatant disrespect it was appalling, all the while wallowing in self-pity and self-hate to excuse his behavior.It was PATHETIC!Then there was the heroine, Tate, who had so little respect or dignity for herself when it came to the hero, that she continually allowed him to use and treat her like a PIECE OF TRASH.Again, PATHETIC!I did have to give her some kudos for the fact she was honest with herself and admitted she allowed him to treat her so abhorrently.As for the romance, for me, it was nonexistent. I found it impossible to feel any romance when most of the hero's POV took place six years in the past. His POV did give light as to why he was so broken, but also focused on how completely, madly, and hopelesslyIN LOVEhe was withANOTHER GIRL.So basically, the whole book was the hero showing love and respect to his first love, while treating the heroine, with her blessing, like trash.I don't care that Miles had a tragic past; the world is full of tragic pasts! There is NO EXCUSE for treating another so cruelly!It wasUGLY, which I guess was the point of the story, but I certainly did not enjoy reading it.Colleen Hoover is a very talented author. Her characterizations are consistently outstanding and she has such a beautiful way with words. My respect and admiration for her work is theONLYreason I'm giving this book two stars instead of one.Oh well, you can't love,or even like, them all.",2
988,Ugly Love,"This book was miserable. It goes toe to toe with Hopeless for the worst book I’ve read by her. There are three things that I think went horribly in this book. First, there is blatant sexism and the perpetuation of gender stereotypes on every. single. page. Second, this main character had absolutely NO self respect. I know this may be part of the plot, but it was absolutely despicable. She let Miles walk all over her and decimate her feelings to a pulp. She was spineless and pathetic, which was infuriating. Even when she would say or think something sassy, she would NEVER follow that up with real actions. But lastly, and probably most significantly, the way that this story is told was just twisted. The main conflict in the book follows Miles. It’s about Miles’ tragic backstory and how he comes to terms with that and how he can never love again. Why, then, does this story attempt to revolve around Tate? She is completed subordinated to Miles, and she’s the main character!!!!!! Tate was pretty much a doormat this entire book for Miles to walk across as he sorted his own issues out. And she tries to sell this as a book about two people in a relationship just for sex? No. It’s manipulative, it’s one of the most UNHEALTHY relationships I’ve ever read about, and it gives off COMPLETELY disgusting messages to young women reading this book. Colleen always writes books that deal with mentally destructive topics, and each and every time it is always done SO unhealthily and wrong. Every time I read a new Colleen Hoover book, it genuinely shocks me that people rate them so highly.",1
989,Ugly Love,"i read this in one sitting and it was ok. i was invested from the first page to last. i appreciate how easy this was to read with the complex emotions involved. it just wasn’t epic like i wanted it to be.i don’t hold these characters to perfection but at times they were so frustrating to read about. at times i was like “Tate, stand tf up, you deserve better” and “Omfg Miles.🥲” the ending felt a little rushed but i did have the biggest smile on my face when i read that epilogue. i simply wanted to be head over heals for these characters by the end but i wasn’t. or not to the extent i wanted to be. their connection with each other just wasn’t as strong as it should have been for me to give this a higher rating.i loved the writing and the flashbacks weren’t annoying like i thought they would be. reading Mile’s poetic pov was refreshing. i love the relationship both Tate and Miles have with Cap. Definitely shed a tear once i realized what the cover represents. i’m over happy i read this book. i just kinda wished it had a bigger impact on me ngl.",3

1003,Ugly Love,"guys did colleen paid you all to say this book was good or whatthe main characters… 😆tate, my self respect queen 😍 is the most two dimensional character ever and trigger warning! ⚠️ miles was playing with tate’s feelings the entire time saying things like “If I were capable of loving someone . . . it would be you.” like okayand yes it was just ""friends"" with benefits but she fell in love and he did knew that or had a clue and still said those things like (????) if you were so sure you were never gonna love her then why say those things and when miles acted like an asshole to tate and shit she still went back to him every time and there was no groveling that was the worst thing about it she forgave him way too fast (because poor miles🥺) girl was literally treated like garbage the entire book and didn't even hesitate to forgive him I can't even try to defend her honestly and don't even get me started on the “My God, Rachel” because the fact that she could look past that is just unrealtheir relationship was awkward and painful to read and his trauma should not be used as an excuse of how badly he treated tate the entire book, there is something called therapy. a year time jump where he actually goes to therapy and then they reconnect would’ve been great tbh but we all know colleen likes her unhealthy couples “It's the beautiful moments like this that make up for the ugly love” lol no. there are obviously books with a lot more of questionable behavior from the mc but how they wanted to make it seem this is how a relationship or love should be is ugh. this is definitely not something anyone should allow, want or search for in a relationship and I know this is fiction but still it's so frustrating.finally, the fact that Rachel gets blamed for everything is fucking stupid, my girl was traumatized as much as miles, she obviously didn’t act in the best way but stop the unnecessary hate 😤",1
1004,Ugly Love,"2.5 'underwhelming' stars!Well...I hate being in a minority when it comes to books. I wanna be able to love or at least like the books that most of my friends love. Furthermore, there is no other book I would really love to have the same feelings for than this book because it's CoHo, you guys. I love CoHo.But.But...I.Didn'tLove.This.One.I wish I did. Most of the things that bothered will be reflected in the way I'm writing this review.Can.You.GUESS.What.It.Is?See, I could forgive Tate for being a doormat during most of the book. I really could. While I don't understand why she allowed herself to be treated that way by Miles, I was willing to overlook it since I've enjoyed doormat-y heroines before. I mean, whatever floats your boat, Tate.But the writing just threw me off. Sent me on downward spiral through.......PURPLE.Hell.The 'lyrical' prose did not work for me. If you can call it lyrical. To me, it was just repetitive.I'm sorry. But it was.My father is Lisa’s new boyfriend.My father visits Phoenix a lot.My father has been visiting Phoenix a lot since before my mother died. My father is a bastard.If it isn't repetitive, it's too flowery. I come from the School of Less is More when it comes to my prose. Suffice it to say...This.Annoyed.The.Crap.Out.Of.ME.It was a chore to read. And honestly, it did not lend itself well to Miles' POV. I mean, this doesn't sound like an 18 year old male.Does it sound poetic? Yes.Is it romantic? Sure.Does it feel authentic?Nope!I would probably felt more of Miles pain had it been written in a straight-up, no BS prose. I wanted it raw and gritty. I wanted the words to hurt. I didn't want to be lulled to sleep by it. Frankly, if I'd wanted to read poetry, I'd read a poetry book.I didn't hear Miles through the narrative and because of that, I became disconnected with his character. I wish I could have gotten more of his POV in the present. I really do. And didn't like that his past was told separately from what's going on in the present. I never really got the satisfaction of seeing Miles tell Tate about what happened to him. Maybe I would have felt something then. Again, I'm in the minority with this but that's just really how I felt about it.I did like parts of it, hence the two stars. I like how the message of how the ugly side of love is sometimes worth experiencing to get to the beautiful parts of it. But Tate and Miles relationship didn't really evolve for me. I think Cap and Tate spent more meaningful time together than Miles and Tate, which is really sad.Thank.You.Feifei.For.Reading.It.With.Me.We both need to find a five-star read, chickie. Our BR record sucked ass!! LMAO!",2
1005,Ugly Love,"for the love of god, let's stop romanticizing emotionally abusive men. miles archer is shit.",1
1006,Ugly Love,"There's one thing I don't understand with romance novels.. When the characters and plot doesn't actually remind me of a love story. This is pure lust and obsession. There's a trope that everyone is familiar with: the man who doesn't want to commit and the woman who wants to change him for the better. It's not new, it's not exciting, it's just boring. This one had it all and I was terribly not impressed. Sprinkle that with sex scenes and this is what you get. I was more interested in Miles' past and I had many theories, but I wasn't truly accepting of him being super in love with a girl he laid his eyes on for 5 minutes. He literally falls in love at first sight. But if you read it, it's more like an obsession.“She's in everything. Every single thing has just become Rachel. It's consuming me. My new favourite flavor is Rachel. My new favourite thing is Rachel.”I was expecting a shrine dedicated to her. I couldn't stop rolling my eyes.. Not only is Miles the wounded hero with the tortured past, he was also just blah. This man had no expression and I get he had an invisible wall but still.. I just couldn't find his character attractive.Tate is also just as bad in my opinion. She will literally talk about how his hand is touching her or his foot or knee and I could not keep my eyes from rolling. Please just stop Tate. You are attracted to his body. You barely know a thing about him and you say it's love? This isn't love. It's lust with a little bit of like. You like him because he's mysterious and I applaud you for not giving up on him but really??? A relationship hardly starts with just sex involved.More quotes from Tate:“I'm not Tate when I'm near Miles. I'm liquid, and liquid doesn't know how to be firm or stand up for itself. Liquid flows.”Tate is literally obsessed with Miles. Miles used to be obsessed with someone else. Definitely not a love story I would enjoy. I'm upset I didn't like this more but the characters were all tortured and obsessive and addicted to one another. We all know that is not remotely healthy at all. I just also didn't care about them. It was all lust and sex. Where was the romance?? And that ending????? WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? After 6 months??? Ugh I did not find it entertaining at all. I was bored and pretty much sped read through most of the sex scenes.First time reading Hoover's work and I had such high expectations, maybe I should have started with another of her books because I'm seriously disappointed.RATING 1/5QUOTES""I've always found guys more attractive when they put less effort into trying to appear attractive."" (58)""That's how it is when a person develops an attraction toward someone. He's nowhere, then suddenly he's everywhere, whether you want him to be or not."" (59)""I just don't want to like you. I don't want to like anyone. I don't want to date anyone. I don't want to love anyone."" (82)""Addiction is an illness, and it pains me to see people forced to live this way because they're unable to help themselves."" (132)""I've wondered how someone could make me so incredibly happy if God didn't exist. And I realized…just now…that God gives us the ugliness so we don't take the beautiful things in life for granted."" (142)",1
1007,Ugly Love,"1 STARYou know when even one star feels too generous?Yeah, that's me right now.""Ugly love becomes you.Consumes you.Makes you hate it all.Makes you realize that all the beautiful parts aren’t even worth it.""{MY RANT}Someone, please explain to me why everyone hates Miles? Now don't get me wrong, i don't like the guy either but i perfectly understand the cause of his actions. Did he ever promise Tate ""true love"" or any other shit? No, he offered fucking with no attachments and no sentimental bullshit, and that is exactly what he delivered. I don't see what the problem is here. I despise Colleen Hoover for romanticizing this kind of behavior. Like,""once i get him to sleep with me I can trick him into talking to me.""or""maybe if we fuck daily he'll eventually fall in love with me.""Ugh are you fucking kidding me? Am i the only one who can't stand women like this? Bitch, please! Self-respect, you need some in your life.Trust me when i say i really wanted to like this. It started out great but after about 70 pages everything went downhill. I feel like there were lots going on at once, but none of it was original. I've read better.-Brooding jackass meets a goody goody.-Step siblings messing around.-""No stings attached sex"".Despite it's unoriginality, it could've still been enjoyable were it not for our main character, Tate, who i hate with a passion. She ruined this entire book for me. Man, i don't think i've ever read a character this stupid or this exasperating beforeSJM characters aren't included. . and i've read my share of idiotic characters.Was i supposed to be on her side?Was i supposed to feel bad for her?I could clearly see why Miles sees her nothing more than a good fuck. She has no respect her herself.I feel nothing for her and Miles as a couple or fuck buddies.The sex scenes were extremely boring and tedious.I pretty much skipped most of their parts.. which is the entire book, sadly. I was so fed up with her bullshit.For me, it was always Rachel and Miles. I was always looking forward to the flashbacks. The only reason i didn't DNF this is because i was so hooked on ""WHERE IS RACHEL?"" or ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO RACHEL, MILES?"" I hated HATED the ending. How the hell do you move on from something like this? They belonged together.This is possibly the last book i would read by Colleen Hoover. It's more than obvious her and i don't get along. However, i am low-key curious about Maybe Someday. Maybe I'll read that one as well but i am in no hurry.UpdatesThere is a very thin line between cute and and annoying.Example: (Illuminae)Kady and Ezra: Annoying.Nik and Hanna: Adorable AF!^(sorry, just had to)^Let's talk Ugly Love now.Miles' crush on Rachel: Hella fucking cute!Tate throwing herself at Miles: Fucking irritating.Dat poetry tho! LMAO!^^He is utterly adorable andpsychotic at the same time.I dig that.^^I am not the biggest fan of Hoover, but want to give her one last try before completely giving up on her.",1

1009,Ugly Love,"“Love isn’t always pretty, Tate. Sometimes you spend all your time hoping it’ll eventually be something different. Something better. Then, before you know it, you’re back to square one, and you lost your heart somewhere along the way.”“Ugly love becomes you. Consumes you. Makes you hate it all. Makes you realize that all the beautiful parts aren't even worth it. Without the beautiful, you'll never risk feeling the ugly. So you give it all up. You give it all up. You never want love again, no matter what kind it is, because no type of love will ever be worth living through the ugly love again.”Wow!! Ugly love is amazing!! I absolutely loved it!! It is the 3rd time I read it and I still cried even though I knew what's going on..It all started when Tate moved in with her brother Corbin. She meets Miles (Corbin's best friend) and the attraction between them was undeniable. BUT... Miles has a past that hunts him every day and Tate doesn't have time for a relationship so they make an arrangement to have sex without any commitment and Tate have to follow the two rules Miles has for her.“Don't ask about my past.And never expect a future.”BUT1)Miles' past!! Even from the first chapter we understand that something is wrong with Miles.. The first time I read the book I thought that Rachel was going to die.. Nooo, it was his son!! Oh my god, his story was so devastating!2)At first, I was so mad sometimes at Miles for treating Tate the way he did, but after we learn what happen to him i don't really blame him! He had serious issues and he thought that love was bad.“If I were capable of loving someone . . . it would be you.”BUT eventually he fell in love with Tate even though he didn't want to because he was afraid!“You're looking at me like you fell in love with me.""""I didn't fall in love with you. I flew.”3)I loved Cap!! He gave Tate the best advice ever!!4)I didn't like Miles' rules but I loved Corbin's three rules!“What rules?”“Well, for one, I’m not allowed to break your heart,” he says. “Second, I’m also not allowed to break your damn heart. And last, I’m not allowed to fucking break your damn heart.”5)I am looking forward to watch the movie!! Nick Bateman was the best choice for Miles!!",5
1010,Ugly Love,"5 Flying in Love stars!Colleen Hoover has done it again. Not that I ever doubted her, but I didn’t know what to expect when starting Ugly Love. It’s safe to say she never disappoints. With her amazing writing style, fascinating characters and original story lines, I was hooked from the beginning. I expected to love this book. What I wasn’t expecting was for my heart to be shredded.Ugly.Love.Destroyed.Me.This book pulled at my heartstrings. I felt so much heartache while reading. There were some lighter moments, but the majority felt heavy and emotional.When Tate decides to move in with her brother for a while, she never expects to meet a man like Miles. Miles is a pilot like her brother. Miles is taciturn. He seems flat. But there is something about him that intrigues Tate.I have no idea what’s going through his head. He never smiles. He never laughs. He doesn’t flirt. His face appears as if he keeps a constant veil of armor between his expressions and the rest of the world.Miles and Tate develop a friendship, kind of. It’s difficult to be friends with someone who is closed off like Miles is. You can just feel the sadness radiating off of him. Then it happens. Tate feels like she is starting to make progress with this man.Miles really likes Tate. But the last thing he is looking for is love. Their attraction and chemistry is too strong to deny, so they go with the whole ‘friends with benefits’ thing. As long as Tate can follow Mile’s two rules, they can be together in that way.“Don’t ask about my past,” he says firmly.  “And never expect a future.”Tate is so enamored with Miles, she’ll take him any way she can get him. She’s never felt this strongly about a man. She feels so much when she’s with him, she can’t get enough.Miles is the way he is for a good reason. The book is in dual pov, going back and forth between Tate’s perspective in the present, and Miles perspective in the past. You get to see as time goes on, why Miles has these rules and why he is protecting his heart this way. When you get hurt in such an ugly way, you want nothing to do with love. No matter how beautiful it can be. But that doesn’t stop Tate from developing feelings for him. Even though she knows they can never be reciprocated.Miles is a character that broke my heart. At first you see his past and the type of guy he was… then you see him so standoffish in the present. It makes you wonder what could have happened to make him that way. I had my theories (all of which were wrong) but once I found out- I wish I would have been right. It was something unimaginable and you can see why he wouldn’t be able to move on from that.I loved the chemistry and the slow build between them. Even though the feelings were fought most of the book, you could still feel them brewing just below the surface.I think every book I’ve read by this author has made me cry. Even if it’s just a few tears, I always cry. This book. I did more than just cry a few tears. Oh the tears. There were times I couldn’t control the tears. They just streamed down my face continually while I read through them. It was heart wrenching and so emotional. Ugly Love made me Ugly Cry. Big time. Some parts were worse than others, but wow. I just FELT so much while reading this.I am a huge Colleen Hoover fan and I’ve read every one of her books. This one has a little something different than the others. Most of her books make me feel strongly and contain a lot of emotional moments, and Ugly Love had that for sure... but it also had much more steam than the others. And yes- CoHo can write some sexy scenes!It’s been a while since I’ve read a paperback book, but when I heard this was out early at several bookstores, I ran to my local store and picked up a copy along with a mini light so I could read in bed. And I did. I stayed up way past my bedtime reading this book. I went into work the next day sleepy and raw from crying, but let me tell you- it was worth it! AlthoughHopelessstill takes the top spot of my favorite book by this author, this will be a close second!Colleen Hoover is one of those people who is doing what she was born to do- she's sharing her amazing stories with us. Her writing style is unique and incredible.Ugly Loveis captivating, beautiful, emotional, and devastatingly painful to read but I’ll let you in on a little secret. The ending makes every ounce of pain I felt worth it. An unforgettable story I highly recommend!It’s the beautiful moments like this that make up for the ugly love.",5
1011,The Midnight Library,"I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.“She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:“As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:“And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide.“Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster —it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not.“Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”,says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.“When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gemMy Real Childrenhad a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora)we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.“She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, exceptit’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.“She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite.“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.”2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.——————Also posted onmy blog.",2
1012,The Midnight Library,"“The only way to learn is to live”Fuck, this book hit me so hard. I finished this book a few days ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn't see the point of life, but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life. This book was so beautifully written and I love the way this book asks the question: what is the best way to live?“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”It's a really cool concept, that between life and death you enter the midnight library, where you get the opportunity to see how your life would've been different had you made different decisions. I think a lot about this, what my life would be like had I made different choices and wondering if I'm the happiest version of myself? This book forces you to ask hard questions, like what makes a life worth living? And are your dreams for yourself really something you want? I love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life.“A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”Matt Haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes I'm obsessed with in this book. Much like The Humans (one of my all time favorites) this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be. But I feel like this book is much more serious than The Humans, there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book, and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book, where as The Humans feels a lot more light-hearted and hilarious.“It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy. We can't tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.”But god damn, I loved this book. I cried a lot at the end. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. I also filmed a reading vlog and I included this book, you can see that here:https://youtu.be/9NiJtrbogyo",5
1013,The Midnight Library,"Everybody probably knows the premise of this book by now (I mean this book iseverywhere): a library with an infinite number of books. The books of regret. You open one and it transfers you to the life where you didn’t make that particular regret. Was it marrying someone or traveling or maybe other little things.While I admit I don’t actively pursue parallel universes kind of books on one hand, and on the other, the main reason why I read this book is that I was choosing the best fiction this year (to vote in the GR awards), I was actually looking forward to it. Most of my friends on GR gave it 5 glowing stars. A book beloved by the majority... I had a high chance of enjoying it. Sadly, I didn’t.First, it was boring. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn’t the best, honestly. Not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone. It certainly didn’t help either that I was listening toEleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fineat the same time, in which the narrator was so animated reading the book.I also found all of Nora’s revelations and enlightenment typical. Like sure I already know that. The ending was also painfully predictable from the start. So when you can guess where the book is going, everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore, especially if you don’t care about the main character. Unfortunately, I found Nora dull. She wasn’t interesting as the main character and I couldn’t relate nor care about her and empathise with her story. I can’t believe she was this multitalented in fields that aren’t related whatsoever to each other. She could’ve been an athlete, a scholar or a musician. All successful. All are based on life decisions. I also think that she had the privilege of choosing such different options. Many don’t. I don’t mean by that the book of regrets but rather focusing on a particular career path from the start. For example, many parents don’t nurture their children’s interests like music or gymnastics for several reasons maybe they can’t afford it or they just don’t care. But Nora had so many options.Luckily, the book was short. I also didn’t hate anything about it, hence the 2-star rating. But at the same time, I can’t name anything I liked. Maybe one of the lives, in particular, was more intriguing than the rest because of the two characters we met and.. the concept. It didn’t help that the book got repetitive sometimes. The premise was much more promising than the book itself. The “message” was also pretty plain obvious. Yet many likedThe Midnight Library, however. So it might be more of a “me and not you” kind of book.But let me tell you this: if you don’t find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories, don’t read this novel. Don’t be fooled with “LIBRARY. MIDNIGHT LIBRARY. BOOOOOKS.” The library is just more of a metaphor. Most of the events in this book take place in the real world. And unless you’re interested in kind of self-help books (or motivational ones), don’t read this novel either. Because it’s more about what Nora discovered about herself and life, of course, by dealing with/trying to escape from her regrets.But then again, themajorityliked this book so you might too and it's simply notmycup of tea.Yet, itwasa dreadfully boring.",2
1014,The Midnight Library,"Okay! No more words! This is one of the best sci-fi dances with fantasy which carries additional philosophic vibes novel of the year! I LOVED IT! ( this is not kind of toasting for the book and raising your glass kind of loving it. This is more like climbing at the top of the roof and declaring your love by shouting and howling to the moon kind of love. If you read the song lyrics of “ Howl” at the book you may probably understand why I feel so enthusiastic and why I’m writing a high volume review!)This book is not only about Nora Seed who is trapped in her life, seeing herself a failure, a disposable human waste who has nothing to achieve, will never be missed by anyone . It’s about regrets, unfinished plans, what ifs, approval of families, drugs, mistakes, giving up, realizing other people’s dreams, self regret, insecurities, self harm, love, passion and hate...When Nora tries to end her life, she opens her eyes in a library filled with books which contain different versions of her life story. If she finds the right book and most proper life she can live fulfilled and happy, that will mean she can be saved!Thankfully the librarian Mrs. Elm here for here just like she has done when she was a little girl who recently learned she lost her dad.Nora could be a swimmer, a rock star, a philosopher, a wife, a traveler, a glaciologist, a mother, winery or local pub owner. She can say “yes” to her ex and accept his offer to live in a small town and own a local pub. Or she can say “yes” to coffee offer of a nice doctor candidate Ash to pursue happiness and love. She can win Olympic medals or she can taste the tempting charm of fame with her songs she writes and performs all around the world. She can be everything or anything.But after living so much lives, nearly thousand different versions, will she find which is best for her and which life form will suit to catch the real happiness?Can she live without family members or can she handle losing her friends to death?What does she really want? What does she expect ? And most importantly will she learn to face the things she regrets the most? Because however she’s ready to start her fresh life with open hands, those clutches of regret always pull her back and prevent her to see what she’s really looking for!Beautiful, meaningful, dazzling, emotional, heart wrenching, poetic, realistic : these are the words which come to my mind after reading this book. Just like the definition of ideal life.Sigh...bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
1015,The Midnight Library,"It is no secret that Matt Haig has mental health issues, dogged by the darkness of depression that has taken its toll on his life. His acute observations and experience of his condition informs this exquisite, inspiring, compassionate and empathetic novel where he creates the concept of the midnight library, to be found in the spaces between life and death, to explore life, the issues that afflict our world, through philosophy and more, endeavouring to tease out what might make life worth living and a joy and what gives it meaning. The device used to implement his goal is the ordinary Nora Seed, who has lived her life trying to please others, who has hit rock bottom, suffering the loss of her cat, her job, overwhelmed by the burden of a lifetime of regrets, seeing no light in her life whatsoever. She is tempted by thoughts of suicide that has her ending up at the midnight library.The midnight library is magical, for a start, the library has a limitless number of books, and these books are far from ordinary, Haig sprinkles gold dust in each book, offering Nora the opportunity to see how her life would have turned out if each and every decision at every point in her life had been different. The books illustrate the endless possibilities that life holds for Nora and all of us. Nora explores each book, with inquisitiveness and curiosity, the widely disparate lives that could have been hers, no easy task as she has to slip into each new life with the complications of being unfamiliar with it and do so without alerting the other people present. It soon becomes clear that there are pros and cons to each book/life, to each decision and choice made, each life containing its own mix of despair, pain and regrets that must be accommodated and handled.Haig offers a touching narrative that speaks of the joys to be found in living, attained through Nora's eyes as she tries to untangle what really matters in life, putting life in context and perspective with all its ongoing changes, complexities, and an understanding no life is perfect in itself. In some ways, this is a version of It's A Wonderful Life, a favourite film for so many people. What I was so struck by is just how many readers might find this helpful for our lock down times, so many have suffered unbearable losses and illness, have had to face not seeing all those we love and mean so much to us, whilst being weighed down with worries and concerns about how to cope with fears regarding jobs, childcare, money and more. A beautifully nuanced novel that I am sure many will love as much as me. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Canongate for an ARC.",5
1016,The Midnight Library,"Okay. Picture this: you are about to bite into a cookie. A big, warm cookie. Kinda crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, yummy and chocolate chip-y and presumably made with brown butter and flaky sea salt, as all the best cookies are.And then you take a big ol' chomp, and...oh no.Not a chocolate chip at all.This cookie is filled with...RAISINS.Have you immersed yourself in that experience?

(They are closer to granola bars than cookies, but my favorite in the Chewy Granola Bar Variety Pack was always oatmeal raisin, like a six-year-old grumpy old man, so that's not a negative in my personal lexicon.)It's just that it could be much better. And I thought it would be.I thought this was going to be a magical realism-y (my favorite), book-filled (my favorite), beautifully written (everyone's favorite) romp through a brilliant new world.Instead, it was a very fluffy, very...done-before-feeling It's A Wonderful Life-esque feel-good discussion of suicide.(I mention this further down, but this is SO, SO triggering for suicide.)That's not a bad thing.

1017,The Midnight Library,"""That is just me. I add nothing. I am wallowing in self-pity.""No truer words have been said by Nora, the world's largest wet blanket. Woe is her, folks.Nora ends up atThe Midnight Library, a place between life and death, because she doesn't want to live anymore. The library is full of books, each representing a life she could've had, had she made different choices. Now she has a chance to undo all her numerous regrets and to try out all the lives she's missed out on, to see if there is another one she would like better.Lest you think I'm cold-hearted for not loving this, I assure you, I'm not. Normally, I love sappy, cheesy, inspirational mush. I watch Hallmark movies. I believe in soulmates and happily ever after. I cry during every sweet scene in every movie. And yet this book left me so cold inside, and I'll try to put into words why.For one thing, this story doesn't come across as fiction so much as self-help disguised as fiction. The lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning, yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be understood if explained slowly and repeatedly. We are forced to endure these lessons over and over every time Nora goes back to the library. Either Nora is the most dim-witted of characters, or the author thinks us readers are.Another problem is that it's really hard to connect with Nora. She'll take a situation, suck every ounce of joy out of it, and interpret what's left in the most negative way possible. She's full of regret for every decision she's ever made, and thinks the grass is always greener. However, other than being negative, she literally has no other personality traits. She's a blank slate, dull and uninteresting.I also have issues with the core messages in this book. Nora finally learns her lesson, but only after having fixated on each regret, remade every decision, and lived all subsequent lives. I'm also uncomfortable with the implication that if you're depressed, you only need to change your outlook and you will feel better. That goes against everything we understand about mental illness, including that it's important to seek out professional help, that it can be chemically based, and that it's not a matter of not trying hard enough.So many readers loved this book, as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews. But it's just not for me. This is the second book I've read by Matt Haig, and I've had trouble connecting with both. So I think it's time I part ways with this author and just accept that we are not compatible.",2
1018,The Midnight Library,"For almost three years I have resisted.Friends told me to read this. Goodreads told me to read this.You'll like it, they promised.But I didn't likeHow to Stop Timeand I didn't finishThe Humans,I replied.Shh, this one's different.It sounds like one of those books where a depressed person with lots of regrets decides their life has worth because if they'd made different choices, they'd still be unhappy.Oh no, it's not that.Sorry, but itiskinda that. The best thing about this book is that it's a super quick read with really short chapters. But I am too cynical for this kind of story.The Midnight Libraryis a very self-helpy novel with a number of cliche messages at its heart.On the night Nora Seed (because she will experience growth!!) feels suicide is the only option left, she wakes up in a library filled with books, each book containing another of her lives, a path unchosen in her root life. Of course, as she explores each one of her regrets, they contain a message that, basically, regrets are stupid and there are good and bad aspects to all possible paths.I'm sorry to all the people who liked this and are having to see me grumble. I shouldn't have done it because I knew, deep down, I would not like it. I am way past the point in my life where inspirational quotes in novel form work for me.To be clear, I am a suicide survivor and have struggled with my own mental health. If this book pulled people away from the edge, if it was the answer, then I don't want to be dismissive of that. Sometimes what feels cheesy to one person is a genuine lifesaver to someone else. I am just trying to articulate that this magical in-between idea does not work for me personally. I think, perhaps, when it comes to mental health, I appreciate a more realistic approach and not magical solutions that don't exist in reality.",2
1019,The Midnight Library,"Nora has a rough 24 hours, and she thinks her life is not worth living. She finds herself in a library where she can pick a book where her life would be different than her current life. Will Nora ultimately find the answers she is looking for? What about happiness?Sorry, this book has received absolute rave reviews, but this book was not for me. I found it extremely boring and unoriginal. There was a movie ages ago called ""The Family Man"" with Nicolas Cage which has an incredibly similar plot. The MC wakes up and finds himself married to his long lost love and is the father to two or three children. Nora spends a good deal of the book complaining about her life. I am surprised that she didn't try to bump herself off earlier if just a bad 24 hours is all that it takes to tip a person over the edge. Many people have horrible, no good, very bad days. They don't jump to the conclusion that life isn't worth living!Why was The Family Man better? Because it focused on one alternate life. He had built up relationships. In The Midnight Library, Nora tries on so many different lives that deep, meaningful relationships were not developed.There were some quotes in this book that I enjoyed. Also, I am absolutely obsessed with Walden by Thoreau, and he had quite a few mentions.Overall, not worth the hype, largely forgettable, and a better investment of your time and money would be to watch The Family Man.2024 Reading ScheduleJan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",2

That isn’t me.I gravitated toward it because of the appeal of the library.We all know that books resonate (or don’t resonate) with readers based on our own personal experiences.Perhaps if you share a certain regret with our leading lady, Nora, you will connect with this book more than I did.Perhaps, it was just timing.This book has almost all 5 star reviews, so please read others for an alternate opinion.Or, if you are one of the few, who like me, LOVED the idea more than the story, know now that there is at least one other person who felt the same way as you.",3

Instead, we get this young-adult-like novel in which the main character behaves and thinks like a 15-year-old, and every other character around her is just a cardboard poster rather than a human being. This is not what I expected from Matt Haig, whose previous books I recommended to people who wanted to understand depression. It's like it isn't the same author at all.

1028,The Midnight Library,"This is a quaint little book. A quick read that I enjoyed. It is another form of the Groundhog Day plots that I have read this year. The library in this book is an infinite number of lives not taken. The opening is a little depressing, but it has to be to establish the motivation for the rest of the story. Even so there is a continued darkness in the tone. With each life to which the character ventures she only has to not like it in order to move on to the next. She is in constant search of that perfect life. The conflict of the book is set by page 38 and the pace increases. I am in constant search of the “Fictive Dream,” where I get buried in the story and the rest of my world falls away. The structure of this book, the constant shifting from life to life gives the story an episodic feel. This story is an odyssey and the character evolves as she comes to realize what life is really all about.",3

1030,The Midnight Library,"A sojourn of a human to the multiverses through a library, which is as normal as this bizarre world without an exit to trap us there. Nora Seed might seed our mind with melancholy and heart with love in her quest for perfection. Can perfection be attained through the careful movement of the pawns in this deliberate game of life? Through the underlying current of sadness, this literature transcends us to a library between the universes with a librarian who is a mental metaphor that can be fathomed only by a few.“Aisles and aisles of bookshelves, reaching up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad open corridor. Books were everywhere. The shelves really did seem to go on forever, straight and long to the far off horizon. There were no title and names adorning the spines of the books.”The library between life and death with a vagabond poacher through multiverses, who gave an open invitation to death and didn’t want to be preserved from death as she can’t decide how she wants to live.“You don’t go to death, but the death comes to you”The fact that the day never ends due to the never-ending light is like living one terminal day. It is exceptionally depressing for an already depressed person who decided to die by traveling with her best companion - solitude from a society so lonely owing to the detachment due to the extreme social media attachment.Does life seem more attractive in the face of death? Is death the one that makes life beautiful? Is death an obligate parasite that wants to change the relationship to a symbiotic one with life?Is the simplification of the three-dimensional worlds by humans making it more complicated?“This is the wrong life. It is really, really, really wrong. Take me back. I do want to avenge. Take me back to the library.In the cosmic order of things, there is no rejection only redirecrtion.”Can a person cry due to sadness, smile due to the speck of light at the end of the tunnel, and be surprised due to the philosophical brilliance at the same time. The reading experience of this book gives us that unique experience.“The thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory.”—————————————————————————You can also follow me onInstagram ID - Dasfill|YouTube First Channel ID - Dasfill|YouTube Second Channel - Dasfill - Malayalam|Twitter ID - Dasfill1|Snapchat ID - Dasfill|Facebook ID - Dasfill|TikTok ID - Dasfill1",5
1031,The Midnight Library,"Are You Serious, Matt?Could it be true that clinical depression arises from bad choices and disappointments; or is it more likely the other way round? Or is it the case that depression is a consequence of environment, one’s less than sane immediate family perhaps; or possibly genetics, an historical aberration passed down from family far distant in space and time? Is the world an objectively depressing place; or made so by our attitude towards it? The philosopher Schopenhauer thought depression was an heroic human condition and promoted it by writing about it; Freud thought it was an illness and tried to cure it by talking about it.Haig thinks depression has something to do with regrets, that is, thoughts about what might have been if we had done things differently. And perhaps he has a point. In his view, regrets occur because of alternative histories we fabricate for ourselves in which disappointment with one’s lot is reduced or eliminated because life would be more fulfilling/successful/happy than the life one actually has. Depression, in other words, is a literary phenomenon. It’s a result of the what-if stories. Imaginative, articulate people, therefore, would be particularly susceptible to the condition. There is in fact substantial anecdotal evidence that this might be so (see, for example,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)Based on this essentially linguistic theory of depression, Haig has a suggestion for therapy. At this point he crosses the line from playful fictional speculation to a less than savoury quackery worthy of Ayn Rand and Tim LaHaye. Haig thinks that some down-to-earth horror stories are just the thing to augment the happily-ever-after alternatives in our heads. Re-write the script, he implies, picking up all the tiny contra-indications of bliss because“undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true.”Or just remember that people, jobs, relationships, and desires change. Perhaps what was the case about these things when the alternative history was written hadn’t persisted. Or the outcomes remain the same despite different choices. Haig’s point, I suppose, is that things could be worse; that maybe Leibniz had it right: this world could be the best of all possible worlds. Disappointment with one’s regrets as a cure for regrets, and therefore a therapy for disabling, suicidal depression?Things could be worse!? That’s your therapeutic message? Are you serious, Matt?Haig even makes a pitch for a sort of group therapy in which those formulating alternatives to the alternatives get together for solace and encouragement. And of course he feels compelled to bring in quantum mechanics to bolster the non-literary reality of simultaneous lives - a cliché I was mightily hoping he might avoid. And the allusion to YHWH as the master of ceremonies (very Leibnizian), in the guise of a benevolent librarian, keeping all the disparate quantum selves in line is pretty cheesy. Ultimately Haig opts for the cheesiest of all criterion for the story one must have about one’s life: authenticity, we must be our realest, bestest, truest self.“Aim to be the truest version of you,”the godly librarian suggests, as if a depressive has a choice in the matter. I think Haig may have been to one too many EST seminars, or at least spent too much time in Southern California reading Heidegger on the beach.Of course in creating these new personal stories another issue eventually arises if one’s authentic self is the depressed wreck one started with. Then“It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from,”says Haig’s protagonist, brought back from the brink of suicidal death. But the important point, according to Haig, is“You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed.”Can one help thinking of Eric Idle’s magnificent rendition of ‘Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life’ in theLife Of Brian? Did I mention cheesy.I think it clear thatThe Midnight Libraryis a grave insult to those suffering from depression. It is a facile, trivial, misdirected, and (did I mention?) cheesy book. Am I entirely off-base in thinking Haig wrote it as a feel-good piece for those who just need a little pat on the back for their recovery from a bout of the blues, or a failed love affair? If not, you’re a louse, Matt.",1

1033,The Midnight Library,"Magical��Let’s be kind to the people in our own existence.”The Midnight Library is a book about choices, regrets, and embracing life.Nora Seed is having a really bad day. She is mugged, loses her job, blamed for other’s people’s failures, and her cat is run over by a car. She is also seriously depressed. This day is one of many bad days that Nora has experienced over the last decade of her life. She can’t take life anymore and attempts suicide.Nora wakes up to discover that she is in the space between life and death known as The Midnight Library. Here, Nora is given the opportunity to take the paths she didn’t choose and undo her regrets. She travels into the multiverse, getting to experience her other lives.What she finds is that the grass isn’t always greener, and in order to live, one must push aside their regrets and embrace their potential.“She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential.There are many versions of Nora, but she finds she is the same person in every life she chooses. She might be happier, but she doesn’t have what she needs, which is love. She cannot heal until she can open up and accept the love of others, but also love herself and recognize her value.I love Nora’s character. I felt all of her emotions, the dark, and the light. She is fragile, desperate, adventurous, a rockstar, a loving sister, a good friend, a kind neighbor, a good teacher, and, most importantly, a survivor.This is my first book by Matt Haig and I love how he weaves in bits of magic, fantasy, and whimsy alongside Quantum physics, literature, and philosophy.This is an emotional read. Reading about a character who is in such a desperate state of mind that they attempt to take their life wasn’t easy, but the other side of this book offers a lot of love, warmth, compassion, and healing. It was surprisingly heartwarming and uplifting.Nora’s story inspired me to turn off the channel of regrets that often fill my head and embrace the here and now.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Penguin Group in exchange for an honest review.",4
1034,The Midnight Library,"This is the ultimate “what if I had done it differently?” story. I guarantee it will make you think and might give you some new perspective on life. Also, while it starts a bit dark, I think people who are looking for a way out of a dark place might find this story uplifting overall.I have been sitting here thinking about how to review this book and I don’t want to say too much about it because after 10 pages or so, everything little thing would be a spoiler! That, in itself, should probably pique your interest; it is so packed with interconnected and surprising content I can barely even talk about it! So, just read it because all the stuff that happens is totally worth it . . . I’ll leave it at that.I was hooked by this book from page one. It is not a long book and because it was written so well, it flew right by. If you are looking for a well written and unique story that I believe will appeal to people with a wide variety of interests, The Midnight Library is worth giving a try.",5
1035,The Midnight Library,"2021 F.A.B. Bookclub pick # I.❤️. F.A.B.It’s incredibly rare that I come across a book that ticks all my boxes. Good characters. Great setting. Wonderful story. This book really lived up to the hype! 🤗 Nora Seed has regrets. In a moment of absolute darkness she decides she’s done with life. Trigger warning: suicide attempt. 😬 She’s pushed into The Midnight Library, where her school librarian greets her and explains the books of regret. Nora opens a book and lives a life had she done things differently. Book after book, life after life, she discovers who she could have been. ❤️ This book was beautifully magical and inspiring. I’d recommend this to anyone and everyone!! It is AMAZING!! ❤️📚",5
1036,The Midnight Library,"3.75 stars. I love how unique this concept is, the conversation around mental health, and that it made me so introspective about my own life while reading it. I was so hooked when Nora went into the first few alternative lives but towards the end I started to get a little bored with lives 4+ (I felt like I already got the point in the first 3 lives). And I thought the ending was very predictable but I also can't imagine it ending any other way!So overall a little slow in the last third but love love love the concept and the messaging on regrets, life, and kindness.",3
1037,The Midnight Library,"I ABSOLUTELY, TOTALLY, UNEQUIVOCALLY LOVED THIS BOOK!!!Who hasn't had regrets - wished they'd taken a different path in life, loved more and hated less, studied a little harder, applied themselves a bit more, had more faith in themselves, wished they'd liked themselves for who they were instead of what others wanted them to be?I'm certainly not immune, and I've actually fulfilled a couple of my life's ambitions, but life is not easy for any of us. As Nora was to discover, we all ""fear life"" to some degree - we learn pretty young that actions can have pretty painful consequences.Some of us stare that fear in the face and do what frightens us anyway. Many more of us, however, will step back and opt to take the safer road. I loved the notion of Nora being able to insert herself in a parallel timeline and see how her life would have been like had she taken a chance on all of those potentially life changing events. The whole parallel universe notion was so tantalizing! Imagine if you, too, could examine and then finally burn your own Book of Regrets and just move on with living your best life now?The first third of this novel is heavily mired in depression. If you've never felt stuck or depressed, you will certainly get a clue of what it feels like after you've read or listened to those first few chapters leading up to Nora's attempted suicide. There was a history of depression in Nora's mother's family. I was not surprised that Nora fell into depression after taking care of her mother during her long, protracted illness. Death has a way of stopping the clock for the survivors and making them examine the value of their own life. I suspect there will be many who will identify with most of what Nora thinks and says in this novel.Nora's Midnight Library is guarded and managed by her beloved childhood mentor and high school librarian, Mrs. Elm. There are several chapters devoted to Mrs. Elm's struggle to get Nora to try to experience one of the parallel lives in her Midnight library. This reflects the very real battle that a person with depression must face to get to the point where they can finally admit that they need help to get ""unstuck."" Matt Haig has given a whole new meaning to the word ""potential."" I totally agreed with Nora's final decision at the end of the book. In fact, I saw it coming even before she had completed her first journey. We can't live someone else's life. The choice must truly be our own if we want any abiding sense of fulfillment.This author - this book - has a lot to teach us. I am so very glad that I decided to check out what all the hype was about: turns out, all that hype was fully merited ! Loved every bit of it, including the sad parts. A full five out of five glowing stars for this heart-stirring, sanity-saving novel. We all need to burn our own book of regrets... and just get on with living our best life NOW!Highly, highly recommended!Note: I listened to the audiobook version, very ably narrated by the British film actress, Carey Mulligan.. . . . . . . . .You can check out this and other reviews on my partnered blog:https://crossingthepond.reviews/",5

1040,Carrie Soto Is Back,"➸4.25 stars“we live in a world where exceptional women have to sit around waiting for mediocre men”➷ TJR never fails to amaze me with her writing style, i always become immersed in the story. all her books have been easy reads for me, i love how she writes realistic, emotionally complex characters and the relationships - it’s what TJR does incredibly well in my opinion, she knows how to write unforgettable characters! i find it compelling how unlikable and realistically flawed her FMCs often are, but i support women’s rights and i support women’s wrongs!! carrie is a tough character and she goes after what she wants with no remorse—because of her upbringing carrie has an extreme case of athletic perfectionism and we get to see the upsides and downsides of her competitiveness, but you can’t help but root for her as the book progresses.— there is a lot of commentary on how women are portrayed in the media and in sports. this was a great insight into how society treats women's successes, especially as they get older. i loved how TJR touched on the double standards when it comes to male vs female athletes - the power and prejudice of the media is strongly present in the book. the media coverage for carrie was quite sexist and derogatory, she is constantly called a “bitch” by male commentators for being confident and trash talking other players (she is a brutally honest person) but when you see male players do that they are always highly praised, it shows it’s only acceptable for men to do it but unforgivable for a woman.➷ one of the highlights of this book is the close father/daughter relationship between carrie and javier. yes he did push her too hard to become the best tennis player and sent her the message that winning was important - this causes her to have a sheltered childhood/life bc her world only revolved around becoming the worlds greatest tennis player. javier was one of my fav characters and you can’t help but feel sympathy for him bc he was at the lowest points in his life after losing his wife and coaching was his escape after being left with unbearable heartache. even though he was tough on carrie, he loved her with everything he had. he had good intentions and he only wanted what was best for her while also wanting to see her full potential bc he knows she had it in her. the trust, respect and close bond they have between each other was really admirable and heartwarming, it brought me back to when i was younger and my dad and i would always watch the Australian Open, he would take me out to play fun practice matches and taught me so many things about the game,, and to this day we still have that close bond - so it was really easy for me to connect to this book.”my heart hurts whenyou hurt because you are my heart.”➳ carrie soto was the number one tennis player in her prime with the most grand slam wins - that is, until nicki chan ties it right in front of carrie's eyes, creating a spark in her. in a surprise decision she decides to come out of retirement to protect her title and reclaim her legacy. carrie was a realistic character and oftentimes unlikable, yet i still found her compelling. she was unapologetically herself, fierce, competitive, abrasive and does not take any shit from anyone and proudly owns the “bitch” title that was given to her. she knows she is talented and doesn’t need others to tell her, nor does she care whose feelings she hurts climbing to the top. we can see that she is a good person but she is closed off emotionally from others and has a hard time losing! i loved watching her character grow and become compassionate and understanding of others and that it’s okay to open up your heart and be vulnerable. i wish we got to see more of her relationship with bowe and friendship with nicki.”one of the great injustices of this rigged world we live in is that women are considered to be depleting with age and men are somehow deepening.""➷ taylor jenkins reid is an absolute genius at writing stories that feels like real life and makes you forget that you’re reading fiction!! just like DJATS you feel like these characters are real people — i love how she creates a beautiful world with unique characters who have depth and i loved how the characters from her other books where subtly incorporated into the story. this was a real page turner, i laughed, i cried and it had me on the edge of my seat, the suspense was thrilling bc you’re constantly wonderingis she going to win??.— this was a light, easy and engaging read but also pretty predictable. this story highlights the importance of never giving up and female ambition in a male-dominated sphere. i love the compelling characters and strong development. i was impressed with TJR’s knowledge of tennis and the ability to capture the excitement of watching a game.",4
1041,Carrie Soto Is Back,"TJR is the creator of epic, unforgettable heroines and the queen of fascinating historical fiction, helping us time travel and experience the vivid images, daily lives, and true cultures of different time zones where we want to spend more time and never return back to reality!“Carrie Soto is back”: might be one of her most exciting, engaging, adrenaline-pumping, entertaining, heart-throbbing novels she’s ever written!TJR’s heroines are flawed, but brave enough to rise from the ashes, learning from their mistakes by taking risks and challenges. Sometimes you really hate them or resent them, but they always find a smart and unique way to get under your skin and charm you with their power, endurance, resilience, and bravery.Just like Carrie Soto did in this book, and just like Daisy Jones, Evelyn Hugo, and Nina Riva had done to us! Both of these amazing heroines changed our worlds! We chanted for them! We screamed at them! We wished for their happiness, and we witnessed their self-growth and their search for the meaning of life!Now let’s focus on who Carrie Soto is!Carrie Soto is a total bitch! She’s born to be a tennis star! Her eyes are always on the ball! The only thing she wants is to be the best, the one, becoming invincible, crushing her opponents, at the expense of winning more enemies and people’s hate! She’s crude! She’s a husband-stealer! But under that ice queen facade, she’s lonely, she’s sensitive, she’s insecure. She secretly thinks people will abandon her as soon as they notice that sensitive part of her, just like the men she’s had one-night stands with and never heard back.Her father Javi was a great tennis player called “Jaguar” who immigrated to the USA from Argentina, finding the love of his life. Since she was a little girl, Carrie keeps visiting her father at the tennis courts where he coaches people for tournaments until she becomes one of his most important students, to be trained to be a beast who destroys her opponents!Carrie becomes callous, relentless, an ice queen, a battle-axe, focusing on winning. She even fires her own father to become the winner, working with another coach who helps her dreams come true!And in 1994, she’s 37, she’s single, her only friends and confidantes are her father Javi and her agent Gwen. Her records are about to be taken away by a brutal, competitive, 31-year-old brilliant tennis player Nicki Chan. Carrie cannot let that happen! Without being the best tennis player, who can she be? Nobody! She doesn’t have any love interest, and any aim in life makes her excited. She has to return back! She has to get back what belongs to her! She has to be the best of the best again!This means she has to train more and work with the man she had a past with. The man’s name is Bowe Huntley, who is a struggling tennis player working so hard to get in shape after being sober, getting through divorce, and lots of game losses.Carrie has no intention of becoming friends with him. They tend to act civil and do their jobs for becoming the best!But at the age of 37, Carrie realizes her life, her goals can change. She slowly learns to open her heart to people by looking at a different perspective. Maybe becoming the best is subjective. Maybe she never exceeds her own expectations.I loved most of the characters! Javi is my star, and I’m taking a bow for sweetheart Bowe, who was caring, patient, and so lovable.I enjoyed the crossovers from ""Daisy Jones and the Six"" as Carrie reads the biography and dates Nina’s husband from ""Malibu Raising.""If you don’t like tennis, this book will make you a big fan by explaining the basic rules smartly. Each chapter keeps you on your toes, and you feel like you've been transported to the tennis matches, sitting on the benches to watch the games live with your heart in your throat! The narration couldn't be more exciting! You jump up and down, scream, cross your fingers, and wish so hard to see Carrie win!Overall, I love sports and anything TJR writes. Of course, I'm giving this book 5 shiny stars! I devoured it and truly enjoyed it!Many thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing/Ballantine for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy of one of the most anticipated books of 2022 in exchange for my honest opinions.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5
1042,Carrie Soto Is Back,"It sends a tiny thrill through me . . . staring up at a mountain I have yet to scale, each match a step toward the top. It has been so long since I have felt the perfect ache of climbing.I'm always drawn towards stories about overcoming adversity at great odds and achieving the impossible through sheer determination and hard work. So is it any surprise that this story totally grabbed ahold of me and refused to let go?Carrie Soto, the greatest player in tennis history, knows the joy and sacrifice of victory. Trained by her father since she was a toddler, she holds the record for the most Grand Slams to her name. But that achievement has come at great personal cost. When a new crop of upstarters threatens her legacy, she is left with no choice. Now she is coming out of retirement to defend her record, working with her father one last time to show herself and the world what she is capable of.What an absolutely captivating story this was. From the very first page, I was mesmerized both by the well-drawn characters as well as the compelling narrative. Yes, this is fiction, but it sure doesn't feel like it. Instead, it feels like a piece of real tennis history brought to life, and we the readers are there to witness it in all of its glory and heartache.One aspect of this story that surprised me is that the character of Carrie Soto isn't altogether likable. She's brash, confident to the point of arrogance, and often rude to all who stands in her way. She isn't always in it for the love of the game; rather, she wants to win at all cost, even if the price is her own happiness. But it really speaks to Reid's strong storytelling abilities that such a character doesn't take anything away from my enjoyment of the book. In fact, Carrie's flaws make her portrayal and her eventual personal growth that much more compelling.There is a lot of tennis in this book. And I absolutely lapped it up. Even as someone who doesn't play the game (though I do occasionally watch a match on tv), I found all the tennis jargon in here easy to follow. In fact, reading it reminds me of how riveting this game can be, and I was impressed with Reid's ability to capture not just the grueling physical aspects but also its mental facets as well.But this book isn't just about competing and winning. In true Taylor Jenkins Reid fashion, it's bursting with heart and soul. It shines a stark spotlight on what it means to be human, to want to strive to be the best you can be, and to achieve whatever you set your heart to. It reminds us that hard work matters, and that age ain't nothing but a number. But it also shows that it's okay to fail, that letting go is sometimes the right thing to do, and that greatness isn't always measured by what everyone else says.Carrie's father compares her to Achilles, and that feels particularly apt. Achilles craved glory and greatness, and he worked hard towards it his whole life. He finally achieves all that he dreams of during the Trojan War, but it comes at a steep price. And so Carrie does too. She is a warrior of the highest caliber, training every moment of her life, for that one moment of glory so that she will go down in history.What a story! It's exciting and uplifting and inspirational, but it never loses sight of its heart. In fact, that is a hallmark of Taylor Jenkins Reid's recent books. And it shows that she is still a master of her craft, taking us on literary journeys so intimate and exhilarating, we can't help but feel they're real.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Seven Husbands of Evelyn HugoDaisy Jones & The SixMalibu Rising~~~~~~~~~~~~",5
1043,Carrie Soto Is Back,"In my opinion, Taylor Jenkins Reid is back!!I know for a lot of people she never left, but after really loving a couple of her earlier books, I have been disappointed byDaisy Jones & The SixandMalibu Rising. The format in the former didn't work for me (I very much like to be immersed in a story) and I don't know what was going on in the latter but it didn't hold my attention.This wasEvelyn Hugo-level riveting for me. I couldn't put it down.Reid pulled me right inside the mind of Carrie Soto and right into each heart-pounding game of tennis. I am not a sports person, don't watch sports, but I was for the duration of this novel. The gruelling training, the ferocious competition, Carrie'sneedto be the best and her fear that she might not be. The story of a young girl who sees other children building sandcastles and thinks:I wondered why anyone would want to build anything out of sand, when tomorrow it will be gone, and you'd have nothing to show for your day.Carrie is not a likable sports personality, which, of course, made me like her even more. She doesn't play to fans, her mouth often runs away from her, and she's a sore loser. She can't help it. Raised by single father Javier, she has lived and breathed tennis her whole life. It is who she is and the thought that she might not be the best... well, it's unthinkable. When a younger player matches her all-time slam record, thirty-seven year old Carrie plans a comeback. At her age, it's not easy. Can it even be done?The bulk of the commentators... They wanted a woman whose eyes would tear up with gratitude, as if she owed them her victory, as if she owed them everything she had.As well as being a fabulously gripping story of ambition verging on obsession, it is also about being a woman in sports-- the sexism, the double standards, the focus on her likability (or in Carrie's case, lack of), the trivializing of her achievements by male tennis players. It's also a lovely story of the relationship between a woman and a father who is also her coach, cheerleader and number one fan.At its heart, the book's message is a simple old one. One that could have been cheesy in the wrong hands, but Reid pummels our heart enough along the way that the message comes as a relief. It's this: everything is temporary and all good things come to an end. You can try to cling to it as long as possible, sucking every bit of life and enjoyment out of it, or you can love and appreciate every second while it is happening and, in the end, let it go.",4
1044,Carrie Soto Is Back,"*DNF @ 32%* I absolutely adore TJR, and I have and will read everything she writes. But this...I just can't finish. It's very well-written, as per the usual of this author, but there were a few things that just didn't work for me.Carrie's father repeatedly speaks Spanish at length. TJR makes no attempt to offer any translation or explain what was said. Readers who aren't fluent will be left clueless. Did I miss something important? Did TJR insert a hidden gem? I'll never know!Also, this book is about TENNIS. Not tennis, but all CAPS. TENNIS. As in, the entire book to the point I threw in the towel, is about TENNIS. There is no drama. No mystery. No plot. There is just the history of a TENNIS career. So, unless you really LOVE TENNIS, you're going to get really bored, really fast.That sounds really harsh, I know, but c'est la vie! Maybe I'll try to finish this again in the future one day when I'm in a different mood, but until then, just no.",1

And it did not let me down.I don't know exactly how TJR had me glued to my book, feeling anxious for some matches that weren't real, played by tennists that are not real, but it feels like they are. I don't understand shit of tennis, to be honest, and one of my friends taught me a lot about it, so I was watching all of the videos that he was sending me, lmao.I can't put into words how great this book is.I'm speechless.Carrie is competitive, fierce, strong, brave and the best tennis player. And she knows it. She knows her potential, so she works hard to win. Because she loves to win.TJR's writing style is wonderful as always. She knows how to grab your attention and keep your eyes glued to her books. Her writing styles is so addictive and fast paced. You don't even feel the time flying!I loved Carrie. She's stubborn as hell, selfish, grumpy at times, but brilliant. She knows how to play, how to make strategies, how to attack, how to deffend herself and when to do it. And after all, she's human.Amé que hablaran usando el ""vos"" y no el ""tú"", lo cual me hizo sentir identificada porque en mi país nos voseamos en vez de tutear, y aaaah, se sintió como un respiro. We stan.I liked Carrie and Javi's relationship. They were a great duo, despite everything. He was the real strategist and had a really good eye and mind for tennis.Bowe was really sweet and idiot at the same time.Carrie finally understood that it's okay to lose and to find someone who's actually better than her at tennis, and not to hate her for it, but instead, see the beauty in Niki's style.I was very emotional towards the end, sobbing so bad because of Javier, but rooting all the way for Carrie and Niki, and also for Bowe.I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN VERY WELL HOW THIS BOOK MADE ME FEEL. I'M STILL PROCESSING!",5
1049,Carrie Soto Is Back,"A Grand SlamCarrie Soto is a tennis legend, claiming 20 Grand Slam titles. For years, her father, Javier, has been her coach. Now, it is 1994, and Carrie is retired. During the US Open, Carrie watches as Nicki Chan matches her record. Carrie wants to come out of retirement to reclaim her record. Will Carrie be able to affirm her place in tennis history?First of all, let’s talk about how TJR, Taylor Jenkins Reid, is such a great author. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, Malibu Rising, and Daisy Jones and The Six, all great books. Carrie Soto is Back is also very readable with short sentences and paragraphs. The pages were flying by, and I found the book easy to read.Second, there is some depth to this book as we sort through Carrie’s relationships and feelings. Carrie unapologetically talks about how she is the greatest tennis player of all time and how much she works for her success. And people don’t like her outspokenness.It really reminded me of a YouTube video that I watched recently. The commentator said that back in the 90’s, when women were asked about their success, they would often times blush, giggle, and say how they were lucky. Only until recently have more women been able to say, “I got to where I am because of hard work.”I have also fallen into this trap before, thinking a person was successful because they were lucky. On International Women’s Day, my employer hired a wildly successful TV anchor to give us a pep talk. Like many people, I thought, “She’s just lucky.”However, the TV anchor passed her resume around, by hand, to hundreds of potential employers. Finally, one station allowed her to cover the traffic report. She spent her week driving around and covering potholes and traffic accidents. On night and weekends, she would wait at the station, ready to fill in for one of the TV anchors if there was a last-minute cancellation. It took her years to finally obtain her position. Luck had nothing to do with her success.And I hope that Carrie Soto is Back inspires more of these conversations.Third, Carrie Soto is Back definitely surprised me, and these surprises made the book stronger.Overall, if you are looking for a captivating, engaging, easy-to-read book, pick up Carrie Soto is Back!*Thanks, NetGalley, for a free copy of this book in exchange for my fair and unbiased opinion.Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",5

1052,Carrie Soto Is Back,"""Most assholes don’t have comebacks.”4.5 starsCarrie Soto Is Backis a novel about family, love, tennis, and the price of fame.The novel opens in 1994 when former tennis star Carrie Soto witnesses seeing her record o 20 Grand Slam titles shattered. She comes out of retirement at age 37 and makes an arduous journey back to the court to prove that she is the best female tennis player in the world. Going back to her childhood, the reader also learns how she became known as the Battle Axe, a.k.a., The Bitch.As much as this novel is about tennis, it is also about Carrie’s relationship with her father, Javier. Their dynamic is the heart and soul of this novel.Carrie Soto Is Backis, in a way, a character study. The reader sees Carrie transform into a star but also lose her fame. Very slowly, her tough veneer slips away, and it is apparent that Carrie is much more vulnerable than she seems.She is not the most likable character, but TJR made me love Carrie.The novel moves a little slowly in the beginning and covers a lot of tennis, but the slow pacing picks up as Carrie’s career takes off.This was my first book by TJR, and I didn’t know what to expect going in. I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did, nor did I expect to cry as much as I did. This book hit me emotionally, and I came to love Carrie, Javier, Bowe, and Gwen. I already miss them.I finally get the hype about TJR!I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.",4
1053,Carrie Soto Is Back,"I think this is my favourite Taylor Jenkins Reid book so far, my love for her writing just grows with every single novel that I read.Carrie Soto is back follows the legendary tennis player, Carrie, as she returns to the tennis world in an attempt to save her record. But, after being retired for years has she got what it takes to make the come back she is aiming for?What a book this was! TJR manages to create such incredible and strong female leads in her books. I fall in love with the personal and unique power that every single one of them has. Carrie has a determination and motivation that I found incredibly inspiring. I loved the message of trying your best, having fun whilst doing it and excepting that it may not turn out like you hoped, but that is fine.The tennis scenes in this sent me right back to my teen years when I used to play. Although you don’t need any knowledge of tennis to be able to follow what is happening. My only criticism was that the book frequently moved to Spanish without any translation. Luckily, I was reading on my kindle so I could translate it easily but this would be tricky with a physical book. Overall, this was a book that I did not want to put down, but it had a beautiful simplicity to it as well. At one point, I became incredibly emotional and actually couldn’t read on, it hit a raw spot for me but was handled so well.I recommend this book to any fans of Taylor Jenkins Reid or those who love a strong female lead in their books! I want to thank Netgalley, Random House UK, Cornerstone and Taylor Jenkins Reid for sending me a copy of this book so I could give my personal thoughts.",5
1054,Carrie Soto Is Back,"Taylor Jenkins Reid, as usual, managed to write a stunning book that will win the hearts of the readers.She chose to discuss the world of tennis through the life of Carrie Soto in this book.Carrie is a true champion who holds the current world record for the most number of grand slams. She retired from the game six years ago. It is the 90s now, and a fierce, stunning player named Nicki Chan is on the verge of breaking her record.Carrie decides to come back from retirement at the age of thirty-seven years to reclaim her record. Her father coaches her. Will Nicki Chan be able to beat the all-time best player? Has Carrie lost her mojo, as few of the sports pundits are criticizing? TJR will give the answers to all these questions through this book.This book is a true treat for tennis lovers. I love the game of tennis and have watched many marathon matches played between players like Daria Saville and Emma Raducanu in women's tennis and between Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Rafael Nadal in men's tennis.If you are a tennis enthusiast, you will feel like watching one of these matches live while reading this book. I think that is a stupendous achievement by the author. She tells even the intricate details about the game so that a novice to the world of tennis also can enjoy this book.The world of woman's Tennis has seen some extraordinary comebacks. My favorite has always been that of the legend, Martina Navratilova. Margaret Court, Martina Hingis, and Kim Clijsters also made some amazing comebacks. Many of the details written by the author about Carrie reminded me ofNavratilovaandClijsters, as I was lucky enough to watch them play on live tv.This is not just a sports book. There are more layers hidden inside it. It is a story of true love between a father and his daughter. Their bond reminded me of the amazing bond betweenRichard Williamsand his daughtersVenusandSerena, who are true legends in the game of tennis. At one point in the novel, I felt deja vu when I read the conversation between Carrie and her father. It reminded me of the words ofMaria Sharapovaabout her father,Yuri Sharapova, and the amazing bond they shared between them. She once said,"" My father Yuri believes in miracles, and so do I."" This book also shows the battle of egos between the players and the race for winning grand slams and breaking records.The author could have been easily carried away while writing this book and could have written it in a cinematic way by adding all the popular elements that readers crave. But she decided to take a different route. She took a realistic approach to the narration. Moreover, she also chose to discuss many important topics like sexism, body shaming, and many other issues affecting the game of tennis.What I learned from this book1) Sexism in women’s professional tennis.Tennis might be sadly one of those sports where women have faced sexism at the highest level for the last few decades. The match between Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams shocked many true tennis lovers. Few of the rules and dress codes of women's tennis have been a topic of discussion for some time now. The author invites our attention to a few of the sexist problems that tennis is facing now.“We live in a world where exceptional women have to sit around waiting for mediocre men.”2) What is the difference between playing to win and playing not to lose?It is said thatplaying to win comes out of inspiration, whereas playing not to lose comes out of desperation.When we are playing tennis or any other game, the most important quality we should have is the enthusiasm and the attitude to enjoy our game. That will be only present when we are playing to win. If we are playing not to lose, we are playing from a position of weakness. The author has done an amazing job in making us understand this vital lesson through this novel.“I am afraid of losing. I am afraid of how it will look to the world. I'm afraid of this match being the last match my father ever sees me play. I am afraid of ending this all on a loss. I am afraid of so much.""3) How do the best players in the world deal with the crowd when they are playing a match?The author tells us the best way to deal with the crowds through Carrie's character in this book.""And here's the thing about arena sports—it's not just about how good you are at the game. It's about how good you are at feeling the crowd when they are with you and ignoring the crowd when they aren't.It's about how swept up you can get in the momentum when winning, but also how defiant you can be when the tide turns against you.""My favourite three lines from this book“I’m not obsessed with anything. I'm dedicated to winning. And I work hard at that.""“Honor is...sometimes just a nice word for ego.”“Good is the enemy of great.”What could have been better?The author chose to make Carrie’s character with many imperfections, and her character arc is deliberately created in an imperfect way even though she is a world champion to make the novel more realistic. I loved how the author decided to raise her voice against sexism through her characters. Still, I wouldn't say I liked a few of the statements told by Carrie. I will share one quote told by Carrie here.“Can you suffer the indignity of losing to a woman twice in one day?”I didn't expect such a statement from Carrie's character. We can try to substantiate by telling about the time period when this story is happening. But this book was published in August 2022, and the author should have been a little more careful about such statements coming from the protagonist, especially in a novel written in such a progressive and realistic way. But this is just a minor mistake I found in this book, and I know I am picking needles in a haystack here. The author wrote the rest of the novel in a perfect way.Rating4.5/5The topics Taylor selects to write for each novel are all entirely different, and every time she convincingly wins the heart of the readers who are fans of those specific topics. I think that is the true quality of a great writer, and I am sure we will see many more amazing books from her.We can easily say that Taylor Jenkins Reid is either a true tennis fan or has done an extraordinary amount of research about the game to write this book. I think you should never miss the opportunity to read this book if you are a true tennis fan.",5

1056,Carrie Soto Is Back,"Championship point to Carrie Soto!Read this if you love-✔️Sports. Specifically tennis✔️Powerful yet flawed FMC✔️Family centred relationshipsCarrie Soto is an athelete who aims to be the greatest tennis player in the world. To achieve that goal, there a lot of hindrances in her way, one of it being her own self. Will she be able to be the GOAT? What will it cost her?I'll admit Carrie was not the most easy person to like. Her attitude in the beginning was not appreciated by me much. But overtime, as I read through her struggles, hard work and ambition- it became so easy to root for her. To see her become the person she wanted to be. To finally enjoy the sport she used to love. This is a journey you don't wanna miss.It might feel a bit slow at times, especially the transcripts but it's so worth it. The ending was so satisfying.I also found out later that there are some references to Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, Malibu Rising and Daisy Jones and the six. I had not read any of those books, this is my first TJR book and reading it as a standalone worked for me. Obviously, I didn't get any of those references but hey, it was a beautiful journey. TJR writes so brilliantly, the writing is so immersive. It's tough not to picture Carrie's aces.So do pick this one up. You wouldn't wanna miss out on the tennis legend in the making 😉",4
1057,Carrie Soto Is Back,"""Everything we achieve is ephemeral. We have it, and then the next second it's gone.""If you've read any of my reviews on my 5 star books, you'll probably see ""sometimes you read a book, and sometimes it reads you"" written into all of my favorites. I believe that with my whole heart. I believe there is a force in the universe that puts things in your life when you need them, and you get to choose what to do with the new path than opens up because of it.This book feels more than that. It feels like it was written for me. I actually had a conversation with a friend recently about how we find things we love and then later, sometimes years later, we realize we loved that thing so much because it was a part of us we weren't ready to accept yet. The reason this feelsmoreis because I've been constantly learning how exhausting expectations are since I started therapy in 2019. That journey has been long, and hard, and will be something I travel through for the rest of my life... and to see that so eloquently written into a book. I truly don't have enough words to thank authors for the visibility, strength and ownership they give us readers.There were so many quotes I could have used as the base, but this one felt the most true. I think ephemeral might be my new favorite word. This is a comeback story. A story about celebrity. A story about a father and a daughter. About expectation, self-reflection, acceptance, joy, respect, life, love, forgiveness and so many other very human experiences. Everyone can find something to relate to: guaranteed. It's about recognizing all of those things and knowing that no matter how many records you have, there will always be someone to come along and make new ones.When we met Carrie Soto inMalibu Risingit was easy to see her as the other woman and not worry about her outside of that simple fact. I love that TJR has decided to make her own little reality within our own, and wrote a story that's all Carrie's. Because there are always two sides to a story, and now that I've read Carrie's, I'll never think of her as the other woman again. She knew what she was doing, and she hated herself for it, and because of that I can't find it in me to hate her, too.From that moment, I listened differently. I heard her father's motivation and heard is as she did: an expectation to win. To only win. To be the best. To never let anyone else be better. My heart broke every time she needed to be more. Every time the transcripts written in the story told her she wasn't enough no matter how many records she set. Every time we saw what people thought of her versus who we see she is.The first time she realizes that her love for tennis is the only thing that matters... I cried. I cried a lot, honestly. Because while this book is about tennis, about being the best and wanting to remain the best... it's more so about realizing you can't be number one forever, and accepting that. It's a journey we all take with ourselves constantly. Or, it's one we should take constantly.I could probably go on forever. I could quote so many things and explain their meaning to me. I could write about celebrity vs expectation vs self. I'm a writer, a book lover, and a huge advocate for loving what you have and knowing what you deserve. But what this review boils down to is that you are the master of yourself.You get to choose to accept who you are or fight to be someone different.The expectation set on your shoulders is a suggestion, not a guide on how to live your life.I hope that when (if) you pick this up, you recognize those things about Carrie. I hope that as you experience her journey, you see some of your own. Maybe you aren't ready to climb your mountain yet, but in this you see that one day you will. Maybe you're ready and you need to hear that,""You are perfect, even in your imperfection.""Maybe you're in the middle of your climb and you need to hear,""You don't need to show them. You just need to be.""Maybe you're at the top, and you need to hear,""I am not proud, as much as I am grateful.""Maybe you're realizing there's another mountain, because there always will be, and you need to hear,""I have always known there is no mountain you cannot climb, one step at a time.""Whatever it is, pick this up and find your path. Fall in love with Carrie Soto,""the warrior, the king"", the maker of her own destiny. And maybe find the start of your own.",5
1058,Carrie Soto Is Back,"**Many thanks to NetGalley, Random House-Ballantine, and Taylor Jenkins Reid for an ARC of this book! Now available as of 8.30!**""People act like you can forget your own name, but if you're not paying attention, you can veer so incredibly far away from everything you know about yourself to the point where you stop recognizing what they call you.""Part sports fiction, part romance, part family drama, part historical fiction AND even part bildungsroman, Taylor Jenkins Reid manages to SERVE up everything I was hoping for in Carrie Soto Is Back!Carrie ‘Carolina' Soto grew up dealing with heartbreak, the sort of pain that can turn into fuel if you can learn how to channel it. After losing her mother at an early age, she learned the ways of the racket from her coach (and father) Javier...and also learned that failure was NOT an option.She also then decides that she was going to be the best.Period.EVERYONE will know her name. And like her or not, she's going toMAKE IT.20 Grand Slam wins later...she's racked up titles, fame, and acclaim...but has also been named ""The Battle Axe."" Reputation aside, Carrie doesn't let the judgments stop her and chooses to retire on this high note. She's content with her choice...until newcomer Nicki Chan starts to claim her turf as new champ, and Carrie isn't having it. Poised for a comeback, she decides to come out of retirement and REMIND everyone who she is and that she hasn't gone for good. But in this new landscape with younger, faster players challenging her body, emotional conflicts and family troubles troubling her heart, and the critics and naysayers plaguing her thoughts, will her bravada hold up?Or has the world already seen the best Carrie Soto truly has to offer?When I heard this book featured Carrie Soto from Malibu Rising, I was a bit surprised she was going to get her own book and also nervous that I wouldn't be a huge fan of this book. I thought this was going to be a sort of complement to that book, and I was a bit baffled as to why one would be needed. I had an especially hard time connecting with the characters in Malibu Rising, for whatever reason, and truly appreciated the time period the story was set in more than anything else.HOWEVER, TJR herself is 'back' in this one, with fully fleshed out characters who jump right off the page (whether it's their serve or not!) and plenty of emotional push and pull to keep the reader invested.Carrie herself is a pistol.She's the type not to hold back, and I appreciated the honesty of her character, so driven by the need to win that little else matters. What TJR does so well in Carrie Soto is to give a voice and a heart to the conflict that I'm sure so many athletes struggle with on a daily basis: how much of my competitive nature is inherently ME and why do I have a compulsiveNEEDto win? My husband is incredibly competitive in his gaming, and while it's not something I relate to personally, it was so interesting to peel back the curtain on why Carrie might feel this way and if her competitive nature informs her character...or vice versa.This was a lot less on the historical fiction side of things than some of Reid's other books, which to me which somewhat sad since I love looking for all the references she always includes in her books. Most of the novel also takes place in the 80s and 90s and since I grew up during this time, I was hanging on every reference...I just wish there had been more! I do love that TJR always manages to weave in different stylistic bits in her prose, from news articles to interviews, and makes everything feelSO authentic, you often forget that her characters aren't real. (There's also a tiny nod to Daisy Jones that made me smile!)Obviously this book is FULL of tennis. If you really hate tennis for some reason...don't read it.I've always been somewhat of a casual fan, so I was worried so much detail about the game would get boring or repetitive (or whiz over my head like a very fast serve) but luckily Reid always knows how to keep things moving and I didn't feel it was too bogged down with extraneous details. Fair warning, there is a good amount of Spanish spoken between Carrie and her father: some of it is easy to figure out through context clues, but I found myself looking up words from time to time.(For example, the translations I found of 'pichona', which Javier uses as sort of a pet name for Carrie, ranged from ""pigeon"" to ""tart""..so perhaps Google can't really settle that debate...and also, maybe it shouldn't!)Perhaps you think you already know the end to Carrie's story before you begin...but when it comes to endings themselves? Through her character Gwen, Reid serves up a PERFECT outlook:""Falling in love is really quite simple, "" she says. ""You want to know the secret? It's the same thing we are all doing about life every single day.""""Forget there's an ending.""And like the legendary Carrie Soto herself, Taylor Jenkins Reid is ALWAYS aces in my book!🎾4 starsNow in paperback!",4
1059,Carrie Soto Is Back,"4 StarsI picked this up for the same reasons everyone else did...because it's Taylor Jenkins Reid and I'll read anything she puts out.That said, I read the blurb and that's it. So, I had completely forgotten that the title character was even INMalibu Rising, let alone her role in it. I don't think it would have made a difference to me either way, as I enjoy books about hated characters, but still...I'm glad I didn't remember who Carrie was until about 25% in because it really allowed me to absorb Carrie independently of anything else.Now, I was not a tennis player and I never played to the level Carrie did, obviously. However, I WAS a collegiate scholarship athlete who spent the majority of age 5-21 on a sports field with a VERY dedicated and involved father. As a result, I felt VERY connected to Carrie...her competitive nature...her perfectionism...and her fear of failure.I also really enjoyed the relationship she has with her father. In my mind, that was the true love story here. Not her relationship to tennis, not her relationship to the love interest...but her and Javier. I thought the unfolding of events leading up to the US Open was very touching and the way the last tournament and Javier's ""feedback"" was layered throughout was brilliant. I also thought the ending was both inspirational AND realistic.All that said, this bookwasquite bogged down with a lot of tennis jargon, tennis strategy...just tennis PERIOD. While that wasn't an issue for me (in fact, I quite enjoyed it), I could see it being an issue for some readers.All in all, after not really lovingMalibu RisingI was excited that this one was a hit for me.",4
1060,Carrie Soto Is Back,"this was a SERVE. tennis pun ha. i have a whole list of these, guys.carrie caused a RACQUET (racquet. get it.) for being unapologetically the 'bitch' we all hated in malibu rising. gave me evelyn hugo energy.but the relationship? lukewarm. comfortable. stale like my secret stash of Oreos under my bed (just kidding mom) (just kidding no way my mom is reading this) (i hope). i wanted her with someone else, this book had the opportunity to be an evelyn and celia story set in 90s tennis but it was a MISS. that was a TERRIBLE CALL on TJR's part.nevertheless, just like carrie soto, this book is quickly climbing the ranks to be my favourite tjr book. so do whatever u can to get ur hands on this book, i don't care who you have to bribe/threaten/physically maim. (for legal reasons, this is a joke) (for illegal reasons, this is not).thank you to netgalley and penguin random house for giving me a copy of what was my most anticipated 2022 read and what is now my favourite 2022 read.",5
1061,Carrie Soto Is Back,"Carrie Soto Is Back by Taylor Jenkins ReidNarrated by Stacy Gonzalez and othersI followed tennis closely back in the days that fictional Carrie Soto competed. Still, when the story started, I thought the tennis talk might be too much for me, too boring. But once I got accustomed to it, I enjoyed the talk, the practice, the coaching, and the games. I especially enjoyed the parts of the book with various narrators giving commentary and opinions about Carrie and other players. Very gossipy!Carrie had been the best but had retired in 1988. Then in 1994, at the age of 37, Carrie decides to come out of retirement as another top player is about to shatter a record that is most dear to her. Carrie's father is behind her decision, he's glad to coach her again so they set to work, focusing just on the four Slam tournaments. There is a lot at stake, including endorsements and money, since Carrie can only make her value as a legend fall if she fails in her comeback attempt. But money isn't what Carrie cares about, she has more than she needs for herself and her charity. It's her ego that is driving her to come out of retirement. Carrie's training partner will be an old flame, Bowe Huntley, a men's player who wants his last year to be his best year.There is almost nothing I liked about Carrie but I understand that in the sports world, like other worlds, being best has nothing to do with being liked or being a nice person. Carrie is single minded again, focused only on winning another Slam or two. She'll mow down anyone in her way and if she fails to do so she'll rage at herself mercilessly. Winning is everything. Carrie's coach father is one of my favorite characters in this story but I lost much of what he was saying because he spoke so much Spanish that wasn't translated. Bowe was another favorite of mine, with a pretty amazing attitude after years on the circuit as the bad boy of tennis.Published August 30th 2022 by Random House Audio",4
1062,Carrie Soto Is Back,"mixed feelings but mostly a positive experience?biggest thing for me is that the whole ~takeaway message~ thing that TJR always goes for in her books is less obvious in this one. i feel like i haven't taken a frying pan of ""THIS IS THE POINT"" to the dome this time and i really appreciate that.but i am noticing that in the past few books that TJR has published she likes to play with timeline in a way that i don't think works. if i were to point out something i think she excels at, it's getting you to care about her characters. love em or hate em, they tend to have nuanced personalities. but the all over the place timeline thing takes away from that. in this book you're thrown into the mid life of carrie and then shown what her goal is: to make a comeback to tennis. great. but why the fuck do i care? we get maybe a couple of chapters showing us her past and how she initially got into tennis. but it wasn't enough to build a sense of ""wow i'm rooting for this woman.""while i think the takeaway here wasn't so in your face, it did feel like the only part of the book that mattered. half baked romance, relationship with coach/dad, carrie's reputation in the media... all things that could have been explored deeply. but weren't. just so we could watch this process of carrie slowly losing her ego.allllll of that complaining aside.i fucking love sports.so if TJR is gonna get me to care about something, it's gonna happen here. and i think it kind of worked. sure it wasn't groundbreaking stuff but i like reading about people kicking ass in really hard circumstances. i liked carrie grappling with her ego. it was relatable seeing her reactions to her competitors. it was a pretty pleasurable listening experience.could i have gone my whole life without picking up another TJR book? yeah. but duty calls and says i have to read this lady's entire backlist.",3
1063,Carrie Soto Is Back,"Goodness, this book was painfully boring!Only the last 15% was exciting.But there is nothing remarkable about this book.I can hardly believe that TJR wrote this book.The storyline is so repetitive.The protagonist is so cocky.It’s all about tennis, from beginning to the end, nothing else. So, if you really love tennis (and I should capitalize that word), you will be extremely please.But I felt like I was reading a tabloid about celebrities and athletes. There was no drama or mystery, and there was a predictable relationship.The use of the Spanish did not bother me, because I do understand it, but for those who can’t understand you will not miss that much, as there was nothing important in those dialogues, except the father’s love and tenderness.Anyways, don’t mind me.This book was clearly not directed to me.But I do recommend the audiobook, which I listened while reading the book.Thanks to my public library, I did not spend a cent. But I did feel that I wasted precious hours.Happy reading everyone!",2

I need something heart wrenching, shaking me to the core, help me feel everything at the same time: happiness, angst, joy, forgiveness, enjoyment, resentment, hurting! Yes, I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH! I want to scream it! Oh, thankfully I already did!I have to add that: This is not beach read. This is GLUED READ. You don’t want to end it and you don’t want to stop reading it so you carry your book at everywhere as if it’s one of your internal organs.I expected to read something more chic lit, soft, sweet story but instead of that, I got an amazing fiction, a remarkable romance juggles between so many things at the same time from friendship, regrets, cancer, betrayal, dysfunctional families and their secrets, enemies to friends and friends to lovers, rivalry between the authors!The things I loved mostly:-Sarcastic but so smart, entertaining, unique dialogues between January and Gus-The soul crushing, tear jerker, heart shattering, intense father and daughter relationship-Captivating the story telling from the beginning: I couldn’t put down this book. I actually devour the pages (maybe I accidentally licked my kindle but its screen looks dustless and I’m the grossest person right now!), I couldn’t stop reading January and Gus’ growing attraction, their struggles to open up and their scares not to get hurt, their stupid and childish actions towards each other. Yes I had some many “awww” and sighing moments. My husband thought I was secretly ordering cases of French wines because I smiled so much and I got appointment from the surgeon because it glued to my face and I’m looking like worse version of Joker right now! I cannot stop!-A witty plot: Two writers were nemesis from college now neighboring beach houses. They both have their deadlines for their books but they’re suffering from writer’s big bold scary blog! (Did it ever happen to me? Nope, after drinking, words pour out from my mind like torrent but next day editing them when you are sober is the most painful experience!) Gus thinks that HEA doesn’t exist but he can push himself to write about it and January could also write some high rated, complex fiction instead of swoony romances! So they bet and replace their places but for inspiration to do that they have to spend time together by experiencing the shiny and dark sides of the life. That means January will take him to carnival, romantic beach and field trips to watch the sunset as Gus takes him to hike at the graveyard or arrange an interview with a grieving woman who lost her death cult member sister. See, it was impossible not to get interested and hooked from the beginning!-Characterization: January and Gus seems like polar opposites. One pessimist who had problematic childhood with his abusive father and one optimist Pollyanna who loves to see from the brighter side even though her childhood was affected by her mother’s big C hanging over her head like the Sword of Damocles. They are suffering from loneliness and their wrong choices about their love lives. Actually they have so much in common and don’t forget THE SIZZLING CHEMISTRY and UNDENIABLY GROWING ATTRACTION!LAST PARTS OF THE BOOK: Oh boy! Please prepare your napkins, paper towels, anything to dry your non-stop dripping tears! I’m not giving spoiler but Ms. Henry is an emotional torturer knows exactly how to sing to our hearts, how to break into pieces and magically gathers each pieces and heals you with soul brushing, poignant words. She is a heart whisperer. She knows how to melt your heart!OVERALL: This is not only one of my favorite books of this year but it is also gonna be my all-time favorite romance books! I’m so happy my great written romantic fiction craving is over!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this year’s one of the best books’ ARCCOPY with me in exchange my honest review. And Emily Henry, thank you for reaching my heart with your effective, soul touching, talented work.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
1066,Beach Read,"I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would, and that makes me sad.I had this as a five star prediction, one of my most anticipated of the year because this premise sounds PERFECT to me. I love books that follow writers, and I love the idea of two writers swapping genres and competing to sell their book first and have a kind of hate to love vibe but also being really cute still. When I started reading this I was certain it was going to be a five star read, and trust me no one is as bummed a I am that I didn't absolutely love this. I wanted to be obsessed with it the way I am with Unhoneymooners and The Hating Game, but this book just isn't it...This book started off fine, I actually really like January's character in the beginning. I feel like Gus, the live interest is one of my issues with the book. He comes off as kind of pretentious at times, and he has this attitude like ""i'm so broken that nobody can ever understand me"" and he doesn't believe in happy endings, he's such a cliche stereotypical brooding moody man character.I feel like the mood of this book was all over the place, because some of it was trying to be light and fluffy 'beach read' as the title implies, but then some of it was actually dark, like January finding out her recently dead Father was cheating on her Mom her whole life, and Gus making them do all these interviews with people from a cult for writing research, or people who's siblings killed themselves... like some of it got really dark so the tone of the book would shift constantly and it just didn't flow.I feel like some of their banter was freaking amazing and *chefs kiss*, but then some of their banter, especially towards the middle felt so forced and like the author was trying too hard to make them seem cute. I feel like January's character was wayyyyyy too insecure about some things, like damn Gus made a comment about her being a fairy princess at the beginning of the book and she literally brings it up constantly throughout the entire book.I feel like Gus's type of male character is annoying because he basically admits he was only an asshole to her because he was in love with her, and like that's obnoxious. I hate how also after the first time they have sex he basically tells her to leave when he gets an important phone call, such a dick move. And then he goes from being kind of an asshole to being like 'i'm in love with you' so freaking quickly, it was cringey. And the actual ending, the last chapter was so cheesy. Of course it ends with a cheesy proposal, like every other romance novel out there.I also wanted more of their stories they were writing, because that is what made me so interesting in reading this in the first place, I was especially curious about Gus's romance novel and I just wish we got more information about the books they were writing.So what did I love about this book?I loved the first 100-150 pages, I lovedsomeof the banter, I loved the scenes of them actually writing (I just really love reading about writers as an aspiring writer), I love the complicated relationship between January and her now dead Father, I love the competitive-ness between January and Gus when they are trying to write something outside of their usual genre that would still sell.I guess I just had too high of expectations for this after hearing the premise and there was just something about this book that didn't quite click with me, and I'm sad about it.",3
1067,Beach Read,"His eyes were doing the thing, the Gus thing . . . and it made my chest flutter almost painfully.I don't get it. What am I missing here?Beach Readoriginally caught my eye because its premise reminded me ofSummer Villa, one of my favorite Hallmark movies. I know, I'm publicly admitting to being a sappy romantic at heart. And I'm proud of it. So why couldn't I get into this story at all?For one, I didn't feel any chemistry between January and Gus. Nothing. Their interactions are so awkward and stilted, it was almost painful. They'll say mundane and platonic things to each other, and then sporadically, January will remind us that heat is filling her abdomen or pooling between her legs, and I'm like, Eh? I can't imagine how two people could possibly fall in love or lust while saying such bland things to each other.This is the second book I've read by Emily Henry, and I've noticed that her female characters tend to be very twee and precious. They have extremely high expectations of what love is, need to be constantly reassured, and freak out at the smallest blip. At one point, January sees Gus's ex at a public event and she wants to scream and cry, before the woman has even said or done anything. And what's up with calling herself ""dumb bunny""? Not to mention, she spends the entire time being upset with her dad over something that was none of her business. Suffice to say, it's all very exhausting.As for Gus, we are told over and over that he has a crooked mouth and messy hair, wears rumpled and faded clothes, and has a sexy/evil look (what does that even mean?). Otherwise, his only characteristics are that he writes novels, and he adores January for no reasons that I could discern.The writing style is fluffed out to the excess. There is so much mundane details about every event/non-event, from the multiple-page conversations on should they go or not go, to the logistical details (transportation/gift bringing/preferred topics of conversation) to the minutiae of everything that happens while at the event. And in between, every step of the way, it is interspersed with information on how January is feeling, how she thinks Gus must be feeling, and what this means for their relationship.They are also constantly affirming what great people the other one is. Gus is dark and broken, but great! January is a fairy princess and a bright light, but great too! And they keep checking in to see if the other is happy. Like, are you happy? I am, are you happy? The conversations were so cheesy and trite, I was crying on the inside.A good portion of this book is spent on the details of the stories they are each writing and their related research. One is a love story that takes place in a cult and the other is a love story that takes place... in a circus with clowns? I don't even know what I'm reading anymore.Where is the flirty banter, the sexual tension, the obstacles to overcome? I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, or some interesting dialog, or some insight from this story. But nada. I'll be honest, this is one of the most boring books I've ever read.My criteria for a romcom isn't that high. I want romance and comedy, but this book didn't satisfy either. I neither swooned nor laughed. I was mostly exhausted from boredom while waiting for this dull story to be over.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:People We Meet on Vacation~~~~~~~~~~~~",1
1068,Beach Read,"This was a fun read, but just that. At least for me. I read the synopsis and I was so excited, it sounded like a romance I NEEDED to read. I mean, the main characters are both authors that write totally opposite genres and they develop sort of a enemies to lovers relationship? I WAS SO IN. But sadly, I found it a little boring.I may be the exception here. I've only read GREAT reviews for this one. Maybe it is because I'm not that into romance stories? SURE, I love romance IN my stories, just not so much if it's the main theme. But sometimes it can happens that a romance books sweeps me away and makes me swoon. Examples:- To all the boys I've loved before- The Hating Game- Red, White & Royal BlueSo yes, there are a few romance books that I love, and I'm always trying to find the next one to add to that list, and I was hoping this was it. But it was not.Nevertheless, it wasn't bad, I really enjoyed some parts and I was rooting for the main characters! And I really liked the dare. So: January is a romance author and Gus is writes dark literary fiction, and they dare each other to write the thing the other one usually writes! That's the sinopsys and it sounded awesome. It was kinda awesome.But yeah, I didn't like the book as much as everyone else. The middle part dragged a bit to much and the way Gus handled the situation when things were getting hard was frustrating. And it wasn't a good kind of frustration, it was one that made me go: ugh STOP. Anyway, everyone is loving this book, so my opinion is an unpopular one.. . .Español:Esta fue una lectura divertida, pero sólo eso. Por lo menos para mí. Leí la sinopsis y estaba súper emocionada, ¡sonaba como el romance que necesitaba leer YA! Es decir, ¿los personajes principales son autores que escriben géneros totalmente opuestos y van desarrollando una relación estilo enemies to lovers? S��, DAME POR FAVOR. Pero tristemente, me terminó aburriendo un poco.Creo que soy la excepción aquí, pues sólo he leído reseñas EXCELENTES de este libro. Tal vez sea porque no me encantan los libros de romance. Sí, amo el romance DENTRO de las historias que leo, pero no me gusta mucho que sea el tema central. Eso sí, a veces pasa que uno que otro libro de romance me toma por sorpresa y me enamora. Ejemplos:- A todos los chicos de los que me enamoré- Cariño, cuánto te odio- Rojo, Blanco y Sangre AzulAsí que sí, hay algunos pocos libros de romance que amo, y siempre estoy intentando encontrar el nuevo ""ROMANCE QUE CLAU AMA"" para agregar a la lista. Esperaba que este lo fuera. Pero no.De todos modos, no estuvo mal. Disfruté mucho de algunas partes y sí quería que los personajes principales quedaran juntos. ¡Y de verdad me gustó mucho el reto! O sea: January es autora de romance y Gus escribe ficción literaria muy oscura, y se retan a escribir lo que el otro suele escribir. Esa es la sinopsis y sonaba increíble. Sí lo fue un poco, la verdad.Pero sí, al final, este libro no me gustó tanto como a otros. La parte de en medio se alargó mucho y me frustraba bastante cómo Gus manejaba la situación cuando las cosas se ponían difíciles. Y no era una frustración de la buena, era más como: ugh ya basta. Jajajaja. En fin, soy minoría aquí, todo el mundo está amando el libro.",3
1069,Beach Read,"I did what any reasonable adult woman would do when confronted with her college rival turned next-door neighbor. I dove behind the nearest bookshelf.I really needed this book. I didn't realize how much I needed it until I was giggling along with all the awkwardness and banter and feeling like I'd been taken away from the dark, dreariness of this lockdown. It's exactly what it seems to be: a very cute, sweet romance.Beach Readis a warm, summery story about a romance writer (January Andrews) and a vair vair serious literary writer (Augustus Everett) who have been long-time writing rivals ever since they attended college together. They find themselves in neighboring beach houses for the summer, each trying to write their next novel whilst doling out perfect comebacks to each other. What could possibly happen?As they get to know each other a little better, they decide to strike a deal: Augustus will write a happily ever after and January will turn her talents to the serious world of literary fiction. Whoever sells their manuscript first, wins.I really enjoyed the dynamic between January and Gus. It's not quite love/hate because the author stops short of really making them tear into each other, but there's a lot of tension created by their competitive history. The banter is funny; a little snarky at times, but good-natured. Emily Henry has also perfected that blend of broody and sweet with Gus-- it turns out Romance love interests can be both darkly mysterious and not assholes. Who'da thought?The story is told entirely from January's POV, which I personally like. I prefer single perspective romance novels because I think a good portion of the tension comes from not knowing what's going on inside the other person's head.I will say that I might have been more critical of some aspects of this if I was in a different mindset right now. While I expected the novel to be cute and a little cheesy, it is a bit more cheesy and sentimental than I usually prefer. I would have been happier without things like this:""I don't need snowflakes."" He kissed me. ""As long as there's January.""I also expected it to be a little more saucy, lol. There’s sex scenes, for sure, but they’re cute and kinda dorky rather than tense and exciting. I know that a lot of people prefer that; I just thought the whole competing authors dynamic was pretty hot and would have liked to see that played upon a bit more. And I loved the jokey banter… I just sorta wanted them to stop the jokey banter DURING sex.But, fuck it. This was such a heartwarming feel-good book. I had a good time, that's all I can say.Facebook|Instagram",4
1070,Beach Read,"Everybody knows I love Emily Henry.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...Like, it’s probably gotten to the point that people who don’t know anything about me or read my reviews know that. Probably the people who do all they can to avoid my crossing their digital path (and I imagine these people MUST exist, just judging by the number of John Green fans I’ve angered) know it too.It’s just that true.I love her and I shout it from the rooftops on the reg.I was very, very, veryveryvery excited to hear she was doing a rom-com, way outside her usual genre of Young Adult Magical Realism About Funny Brave Prickly Young Women Who Have Magic Or Are Magic Or Are Uniquely Capable Of Seeing Magic, And Their Funny Fun Unique Bands Of Friends.(My favorite genre.)In fact I think I commented a concerning all-caps something or other on her Instagram announcement to convey the sheer breadth of my excitement, an event which I’m sure was mildly to severely frightening and yet she handled with grace and poise.With each passing day I grow more convinced I am a concerning presence on the outskirts of Emily Henry’s online life.But I digress.As I write this, my Goodreads review of this book contains five updates. Yes. I am currently writing my review, and yet I have already written five small reviews. Again. Excitement.This book was NICE. It is not my favorite Emily Henry book (a very tall order), but it does act as the first step in the execution of one of my most hoped-for dreams: An Emily Henry book in every genre. Which in turn is a step toward the pinnacle of my wishes: That all books be written by Emily Henry.A step in the right direction.This is often more Rom than Com. There’s a lot of Character Development and Relationship Arcs and Changing Life Paths here. It is overall a more serious book than that crazy-cute cover would imply.Which is the perfect real-life execution of one of the themes of this book: Literature is no less literature-y for being written by women, or for being written for women, or for ending happily.Books are books and books are good.Especially if they’re written by Emily Henry.Bottom line: <3",4
1071,Beach Read,"i feel like emily henry personally wrote this book for me. ngl i feel like emily henry writes all her books to me, because i connect to them on more than a surface level.✨✨emily henry put her whole ass and tits into this book. i’ve read “people we meet on vacation” and enjoyed it but “beach read” is the fucking bread and butter yall. her writing is like no other and these characters are nothing is not precious. this is definitely going down as one of my all time favorite contemporary romance. 🥹Gus is the definition of a man written by a woman. he is a true gem. for a book that’s entirely in one character’s pov, we got so much depth and structure to his character. he is a rarity and i love him so much. he was an easy character to fall head over heals in love with. from the things he says to the way he expresses his touch through his touch. i would literally fucking die for him. 😩January was such a relatable and deep character. i honestly wasn’t expecting this book to reach any sort of heavy topic but i was aching for these characters, especially January. Her growth from the first few pages to those last was incredible to read about. she’s a baddie that deserves the world and nothing less. 💖i was hooked from the start to the finish. the ending was the cutest thing ever and left me with the biggest smile on my face. emily writes her characters and plot so realistically. it’s refreshing. like i said before i was aching for these characters. they are my comfort characters and i’ll protect them at all cost bitch😭🤟🏽💖✨",5
1072,Beach Read,"this was a goddamn delight!!i know, i’m surprised too, another romance book that i loved? unheard of. tbh, i can’t even really explain my change of heart. maybe the turbulence of the year 2020 has softened me to the idea of cliche tropes and consistent Happily Ever Afters, maybe i’ve always been a squishy-hearted romantic in denial, or maybe i’m just finally learning how to pick titles that tickle my fancy...but i’m not really that invested in justifying my newfound love of literary love, i’m too busy having the time of my life.beach read was soft and sweet, with lots of flirty banter mixed with family drama/discussions, and research about CULTS (yes u read that right). there was a good amount of purse-wine drinking and a killer second chance romance...and boy, did i enjoy it.emily henry managed to strike a great balance between beachy, summertime fun & thoughtful convos about grief and childhood trauma. as someone who loves the wholesome romances, but also gravitates towards books about dark, sad shit, this hit a LOT of buttons for me (i’ll say it again, ~cults~)i know that this has been getting an extraordinary amount of buzz, and i’m just a romance newbie who probably doesn’t have the cred to say what exactly is top tier. however, as someone with *too* specific taste most of the time, this definitely got the job done for me & u might like it too? or not, in which case, more gus everett for meeeeeeeee",4
1073,Beach Read,"*yawn* I'm really sad I wasted my time on this romance that was completely overhyped, in my opinion.I can't really describe what turned me off from this story, but I just could not get into January and Augustus' budding relationship as they both make a bet and write stories that are out of their comfort zone but ended up being stories that match the same structure as their previously published books. The stories they wrote took up a decent chunk of the plotline, in terms of research, and I just could not begin to care about their WIP or Augustus' out-there cult book.I also just did not feel connected to January's past relationship with a seemingly perfect man named Jacques who seemed like a placement character whose existence is for the purpose of making January seem like a well-rounded character with a ~dark past~. I wish I could have connected to her character more, but there just was something missing that I can't put my finger on.I don't know. The romance wasn't engaging, the characters' backstories didn't interest me, and after reading such amazing romances, I have higher standards for romances, and this was not it for me.",1

To jedna z tych książek, która miałaby cztery strony, gdyby bohaterowie sobie pogadali chociaż raz. Also, nic w tej książce nie ma znaczenia. Dosłownie nic - na pierwszej stronie wiadomo jak to się skończy, a to że oni się kłócą i się nie dogadują jest tylko po to, żeby ""głupiego czytelnika potrzymać w niepewności"".

1076,Beach Read,"I LOVED People We Meet on Vacation, but Beach Read just wasn’t for me. It’s not a bad book by any means! What’s unique about Emily Henry’s approach with romance is that her books feel less like a story revolving around relationships and more of a story focusing on individuals who come together and heal together. I appreciated the depth and internal struggles that the characters faced outside the relationship. For some reason though, I wasn’t feeling the romance. Instead, I found myself more invested in the plot of these two authors swapping genres rather than the romance itself (though the book barely touches upon the former).",3

1084,Beach Read,"Don't let the cover and blurb fool you...This ain't stereotypical chick-lit.And before anyone gets their feathers all ruffled at my use of the term ""chick-lit""....calm down. I actually picked this out as one of my Book of the Month picks this April because I thought itwaschick-lit. And, if you have read my reviews or followed me for any length of time, this would surprise you as I have traditionally NEVER been drawn to those kinds of books.Nothing against them, they just never interested me. But alas, as I have mentioned in some reviews over the last couple years, my tastes have changed a lot lately and I am reading all kinds of genres I never used to be interested in.Personal growth? Maybe.The fact that I am quickly approaching ""middle-aged?"" Perhaps.But I digress.The blurb on this really interested me. I thought it was going to be light and exactly what I needed to forget the world for a few hours. And it was.But it was also so much more than that.The two main characters here (January and Gus) were both going through some shit that felt real and nuanced. There was a depth to them that was tangible. And the setting - while seemingly plucked straight out of a Nicholas Sparks book - never felt contrived or cliche.The romance (and so many other elements in the book usually considered trope-y in chick-lit or women's fiction) was written with a tongue-in-cheek hilarity that on one hand called itself out, and on the other, served to undercut any sense of the cliche.I was really impressed with Emily Henry's writing and style. I enjoyed her ability to flirt with the fourth wall and turn certain things on their head in a manner that made you laugh at it, but also seriously consider it at the same time.I also really enjoyed all the discussions on writing and the literary/popular culture jokes and references sprinkled throughout the story.In short, I loved every moment of this book and will definitely be reading more from this author in the future.",5

1086,Beach Read,"“I’ve never met someone who is so perfectly my favorite person.”I picked upBeach Readon a whim, looking for a fun distraction to while away the day and found a couple my heart won’t soon forget.Deeply movingand perfectly paced,Beach Readis a love story riddled with infectiously snarky banter hiding behind a somewhat ironic title. This emotionally adept read was everything I didn’t know Ineededat this very moment.Utilizing her engaging and clever wordplay,Emily Henrybrings readers into the lives of two very different writers. There’s January Andrews, a once optimist romance writer, battling her own heart while slogging through a bout of writer’s block. And then there’s Augustus (Gus) Everett, a twice published literary author, all broody and mysterious, fighting creative demons of his own. A mix of crappy circumstances and serendipity find January in a lake house for the summer and next-door neighbors to her college rival, Gus.While there are some lust-filled memories for her to conjure from college, January knows behind that sexy, evil grin of his grumpy Gus has never taken her writing seriously. In an attempt to banish the writer’s block, and prove they can write in each other’s respective genres, a challenge ensues. And it’s not your typical love/hate battle. It’s a tit-for-tat, sarcastic tease fest that made me laugh, brought me to tears, and ramped up the pitter-patter of this optimist heart of mine.Henry is masterful in her unraveling of both characters, really getting down to the crux of who January and Gus are, and more importantlywhy. Proving assumptions can be the inhibitor of joy. And while this story is told entirely from January’s perspective, a heady mix of her goading, slipped secrets, and admissions from the man himself provide a glimpse into the soul oflovableGus. His heartfelt musings to January areeverything.“Before that.”Relatable, raw, and at times even a little awkward, January and Gus together managed to chip off a chunk of my heart to call their own. Witty exchanges paint the pages and provide the perfect counterbalance to the hurt in their apprehensive hearts. Yet, it’s the undeniable connection they share, and the palpable tension clouding every nook and cranny around Gus and January that makes for such anunforgettableread.The title seems a bit ironic, givenBeach Readhas more substance or depth than it suggests. Considering the author’s level of biting humor throughout the novel and her exploration of the stereotypes swirling around the romance and women’s fiction genre, I assume this was purposeful. And very well played.If you pick up one love story this year, make it Gus and January’s.*Thank you, thank you, thank you to Berkley Publishing for access to an advanced copy via NetGalley.

1088,Beach Read,"5 starsBeach Readwas my first Emily Henry book and I was blown away. Don't let the cover fool you, this isn't some light and fun chick lit story. It's a beautiful romance that has a lot of depth and emotion and I couldn't have loved it more.January and Gus are both published authors in neighboring beach homes. January just got to her late father's beach house and has a lot of questions. Her recent life events have put her in a bit of a funk when it comes to writing the romance she normally writes. Gus writes more serious literary fiction and they decide to switch genres as a bet to see who can write and sell a book first. To do this, they end up spending a lot of time together and go on adventures to help each other out.I loved the friendship January and Gus developed. Watching it change and grow was one of my favorite parts of this book. I loved how these two could be open and honest with each other and they challenged each other in the best ways.I was too much of a romantic for anything to stay casual, and even if we were totally incompatible, I was already in deeper with Gus than a purely physical attraction. And it seemed like neither of us could stop pushing the boundaries.Beach Readis witty, swoony, and hella romantic. It has a grumpy hero which I love and I seriously couldn't get enough of January and Gus together. Their 'dates' left me with the biggest smile on my face and their chemistry and back and forth was the best. These characters and their story were complex. And it captivated me from the start and never let go. They were both realistic and smart and relatable.I haven't had a ton of five star reads in 2020, but the ones I have had have been epic. This had the perfect banter, a slow burn romance, and gave me so many feels. I mean, really... what more could I ask for? it was the perfect kind of romance for a reader like me and I highly recommend it!""When I watch you sleep,"" he said shakily, ""I feel overwhelmed that you exist.""",5

1090,Beach Read,"Reading this book for the second time was an experience of the best kind. It has left me exhausted.Emily Henry is a witch with words, because there’s no way that it’s normal that I’m affected by a story like this.I guess I can say that about all of my favourite books.But there seems to be something particularly unique about her books and I don’t know how to express that in a way that makes sense.“…when the world felt dark and scary, love could whisk you off to go dancing; laughter could take some of the pain away; beauty could punch holes in your fear.”It’s a feeling of comfort, I guess? Of finding safety and security within a story. Of finding peace and a sense of calm within it too despite the heavy subject matters. I trusted the process and the journey Emily Henry took me on.You’re left a little heartbroken but healed and hopeful too.I don’t know what my favourite part of this story was. There isn’t just one. There’s many. It’s all of it. There’s so much to it that if I was to really dive into it, I’d come out with an essay. But I left that bullshit of writing essays behind in school.All of that to say, I loved it. I really, really loved this story. Soul level and all that good stuff.""Shadi was always the very best, but Shadi in love—there was nothing like it. Somehow, she became even more herself. Even wilder, funnier, sillier, wiser, softer. Love lit my best friend up from within…”Trigger warnings:loss of a parent, cancer, cheating.———————————————Well then.I’m out of tears.The hype was super real. It didn’t end up being a 4-star read. It ended up becoming one of my favourite stories ever instead.———————————————I’m going to be irritated if this ends up being a 4-star read. 🙂",5

1092,Beach Read,"5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺Hands down, this is the best rom-com-that-is-not-exactly-rom-com novel I’ve read (but anyway, I don’t really have experience with the genre).But, I have to say this because it is true. This bookslaps.I’ve heard so many things about it, I’ve also read so many good reviews and then I justhadto get it. And immediately after I got it I dug into it andit felt right.Beach Readis not exactly the typical rom-com…and maybe it isn’t rom-com at all. It is contemporary romance, it is adult fiction and it is humorous, definitely. But it is more to it than just a good pun.What I mean to say is that the banter between January and Gus, the two main characters, is genuine and natural. And definitely witty. This book was made with a touch of the art of smart-mouthed dialogue and I loved it.Besides that, January is just a little bit of a clumsy girl and that definitely gives her the opportunity to star into little incidents that stimulate both laughter and the “Gee, she’s mood” kind of situations for us, the readers. You have no idea how many times I felt like locking myself in someone’s bathroom and drinking wine out of my purse until I am socially ready to mingle at a gathering.There are issues going deeper the surface plot of the book which makes it a little bit more complex and adds a tad of real-life situation, something like a healthy dose of reality within a dream.Both January and Gus are writers – completely opposites, I might add – but they somehow end up being neighbours and trying to challenge each other to step in each other’s shoes and write something completely different from what they normally do. And this is the perfect opportunity (or excuse) to fall in love, really.They spend so much time in each other’s company that they realise how lonely they are, in fact. And how hurt. And so, each other’s proximity helps with their individual growth.They both have some problems that darken their lives, trailing after them like needy shadows.Januaryused to romanticise everything around her, thinking that the world can be good, choosing to see the good and the happy and not the bad and the ugly. But finding out something not so pleasant about one of the most important people in her life shook her world. And she had to wake up from her pretty dream and see what’s in front of her – real life.Gusis cynical by his nature. He’s been through too much shit to actually see the love and the good in the world. When the world is harsh with you and tries to push you in a corner to beat you up with every chance it gets, it is not really one of your priorities in life to fall in love with unicorns. That’s probably why every ending in Gus’s novels is kind of bitter.Through their friendship, Gus and January learn to see the other halves of their glasses, the ones that they’ve been ignoring their entire lives – January learns that life is not always about happy-endings and Gus realises that there is love in the world even if it’s hidden away from sight.This book actually made me tear up a bit, I am not going to lie, I had to fight my tears back even though the urge to get up and get a tissue killed me.If I look at it better, I can say that this has been:- Funny and somehow relatable;- Sweet and tender;- A good dose of not-everything-is-perfect-but-it-could-be-worse reality;- Emotional and beautiful.I definitely think this is one of my favourite contemporary romance books and I am super happy that I actually made myself pick it up. I mean, I wasn’t planning on reading it but after I said what the hell, I was kind of completely hooked.IT’S SUPER TRUPER GOOD.",5
1093,Beach Read,"My only regret is not having read this on the beach outside my cute beach house next to my sexy writing partner slash college rival. Oh wait...‘As different as I’d thought we were, it felt a little bit like Gus and I were two aliens who’d stumbled into each other on Earth only to discover we shared a native language.’January Andrews is a Best Selling romance author. Augustus ‘Gus’ Everett is a popular literary fiction author. Old college rivals, the two of them are neighbours for the summer.As is custom when one confronts your old rival: a deal is struck. For the summer they'll swap genres. Gus will write something happy and January will write a book where the characters don't live‘happily ever after’And they'll both try not to give in to the obvious attraction between them. But that goes without saying.I was expecting cutesy and flirty summer romancebut I got so much more!The writing was so addictive and easy. I think the only thing that could have improved this book is if we had point of view chapters from Sexy Gus (yes that's what I call him OK, it takes unknown skill for an author to make a character with a name like ‘August’ sexy).I lived for every interaction between January and Sexy Gus . The banter, the slow burn, the pacing — everything was just perfection.This is the book I never knew I needed. I would also like to take the time to thank Emily Henry (who obviously is not reading this but ya know, I'm putting it out into the universe and all that) for coming up with a truly genius premise.As y'all know, I read a good amount (a lot) of adult romance (check out myfave adult romance shelf) and recently I've been so bored with all the recycled tropes and plots and honestly this was such a breath of fresh air!!The rivals trope is one of my favourite tropes (best example of this is my obsession with The Hating Game) and it was so bloody brilliant in this one.It was beautiful to watch January and Sexy Gus discover how much they have in common, learning to be vulnerable with each other and sharing their pasts with one another.Something I didn't expect to enjoy was their writing process. I found it immensely fascinating to read about what an author does to prepare for a book. The writing marathons, research excursions and setting word count goals —were precious everyday author moments that I never gave much thought to before.If you're looking for a unique romance book with great tropes, ‘A Grade’ banter, addictive writing then you're wasting your time reading this review!

1094,"Twisted Games (Twisted, #2)","i was gonna write a full review for this but i decided against it in the end. i don't even know how i could expand on what i say.the time jumps made this all the more unrealistic. it just added to the the telling and not enough showing.it's basically insta lust. 5% and mans commented that his dick had already gotten hard at bridget. bridget also had a wet fantasy dream about him pretty damn early on. the two spend more time having forbidden sex than forbidden love. so yeah, i'm here to say thatTHIS IS NOT SLOW BURN.not romantically and not sexually! less than 20% and rhys was already wishing to spend more time with bridget even though like, 10% ago he said he doesn’t get involved in clients personal lives and isn’t their friend or what not. i think one reason people say this is slow burn is because two years pass until rhys and bridget kissbut we don't even see those moments of the two years, so it makes it hard for to believe and accept their feelings. if that doesn't bother you, you might like the relationship more.all the secret glances and soft touches i was expecting? non existent to be honest. i think part of it also has to do with the slow burn i didn't feel. i would have thought they had their first kiss around, at least, 60% or so, with everything before being full of stolen glances, touches, and moments between them.in conclusion: i didn’t feel the tension, it’s all sexual. i'm too sappy and asexual to believe on the sexual desire with no emotional connection.rhys…i expected him to be more broody and cold for how he was described. he had this cold aura, so you'd expect him to follow through with that harsh attitude. but, nothing new. even alex from the first book was more cold. sure rhys fits in the “touch her and you die trope” but he was a pretty big softie from the beginning. he had no character development. he wasn’t mysterious and broody at all. nothing but possessive and jealous tbh. that didn’t even bother me because i knew he was that, butthat was it.sure he has a sad background but i literally feltnothing.bridget has no dignity lmao she’s basically rhys’ dog and it’s funny seeing her give herself up for him. mans literally made her crawl 😭rhys talks dirty. other than that there’s nothing else about him that was appealing. tattooed and scarred. muscled. NEXT!and the suspense element was also much better in the first book because there was actually some action. the suspense (can we even call it that?) in this was so badly done compared to the first book. i think i appreciate ava and alex's story more in that aspect because we actually see it unfold and, like i said, there was actually some action. not only that, but right from the beginning, we're thrown into this ""suspenseful"" act so we go through the book wondering what's happening (even if you know what it was). with this, there was none of it for me.i liked that bridget volunteers at an animal shelter. my vegan animal loving self just loves everything animal care related.that's basically it.eh, i’m excited for jules and josh’s book though!and stella and christian? with that ending? 👀",1
1095,"Twisted Games (Twisted, #2)","OMFG this was so good !!! way better than the first one. this book fucked me up !! literally my bones were shaking the entire time i was reading this.Rhys -fuck !!! he’s a MFing DILF !!! this zaddy could take me anywhere. ok so get this - Bridget is the royal princess, she has some authority, but guess who’s in charge? MFing Rhys!! this guy so fucking feral over her and it’s the best thing to readBridget -ugh i fricking loved her!! literally did some boss ass queen shit this entire book!!the plot itself was so good and enticing. i was genuinely so invested!! if this book were a pole, i’d strip on it !!",4

1097,"Twisted Games (Twisted, #2)","4,5 stars! The forbidden romance 😍 the slow burn 😍 the fact that she's a princess and he's her bodyguard 😍 the spice 😍 I liked Twisted Love, but I LOVED this sequel.Rhys is definitely a protective alpha male type which isn't quite my ideal book boyfriend. That's the only reason I gave it 4.5 instead of 5 stars (but that's just a personal taste thing). One thing I didn't expect and really loved was how much princess subplot we got. Outside of the romance, we get a really rich plot of the politics of Bridget's country and the responsibilities and pressures she's under as a princess.Also, I loved that there's a HUGE reason they can't be together for a good part of the book. No silly miscommunication or a third-act conflict that felt unnecessary. Instead, we get a huge challenge they must overcome, which I really appreciated.",4
1098,"Twisted Games (Twisted, #2)","this book makes me rage. rhys has got to be the most boring fucking character ever written. personality? non-existent. bland? boring? insanely annoying? present, present and present. i didn’t feel the tension between them at all. the story itself is just so uninteresting that it took me months just to read halfway through.he is just dirty talking all the time. they do more fucking than actual loving. it’s not slow-burn. the time jumps was an insanely stupid thing to add? it was all show and no tell so we’re just supposed to imagine sexual tension and build-up in those 2 years of him being her bodyguard 🤨🤨🤨rhys: ""i don’t get involved with clients""also rhys: *instantly in love and hard for bridget after seeing her for 5 seconds*this book is just one huge joke. nothing special about mc bridget either. so much anger inside me rn bc of this.would not recommend. sorry to everyone who actually enjoyed this. i didn’t find anything to enjoy about this book",1

1101,"Twisted Games (Twisted, #2)","I changed the rating to 4.75 from a 4.5. Here’s the thing—this had all of the makings of a 5 star book EXCEPT for the fact that I found the beginning quite slow. And I fully get that its slow burn, its meant to be that way, but I can’t ignore how i felt when I was still in the beginning stages.There are TONS of build up in part 1, and the book itself really started taking off for me in part 2. The build up in part 1 is still soooo good, especially looking back at it now. I definitely appreciate it more after finishing the whole book more than i did when i was going through it.I am so obsessed with Rhys and Bridget, but obviously definitely Rhys because that’s my guyyyyy.Bearded, protective, HOTTTT, possessive, supports and adores and loves Bridget so much. OOOOOF, come to mama.Bridget is my favorite from the friend group I think. And I definitely liked this book wayyyy more than i liked the first one, twisted love.I think the writing improved a ton, and the time jumps were that much easier to follow whereas i felt like it was a little difficult to know how much time had passed in the first book (one of the main reasons I gave that a 4). This one is just way better for me. ITS STEAMIER, ITS SO POSSESSIVE, the tension between them. I’m literally so into it 😂And I cant stop thinking about Rhys. This man is BEAUTIFUL. All of the qualities i like in my alpha characters.How part 1 felt for me is mainly the reason this isn’t getting 5 stars because i feel like that’s my first impression and it’s like one of those things where when i was in school, people always told me to go with the first answer when i was taking an exam 😂 so I’m applying that same theory here LMAOChef’s kiss, i hope you guys enjoy this when you get to it!

Rhys and Bridget will always be one of my favourite couples of all time and I honestly can’t get enough of them!!First of all, this book has one of my favourite (but also one of the most painful) tropes of all time in it: Forbidden love!!!This alone already had me hooked and in love but the way it was executed… COMPLETE AND UTTER PERFECTION!!!!!The secrecy, the tension, the pining, the chemistry.. UGH it was just all soooo good and so well written!!! The way they both wanted one another since the beginning.. I was MELTINGGGG!!!!The way the forbidden love trope was mixed with the bodyguard x princess trope made it even better!!! The vibes and settings in this book were absolutely immaculate!! From gorgeous Costa Rica to a stunning castle ugh I LOVE IT!!! I honestly need more books like that with that sort of setting, it’s just so… romantic!!!Speaking of romantic, THESE TWO ARE DEFINITION OF SAID WORD!!!!!!I was literally squealing, giggling, kicking my feet, twirling my hair and blushing like a goddamn tomato!! They were just so adorable!! They had everything they needed to have! Banter, chemistry, tension (romantic and sexual), cuteness, jealousy, spice and MOREEEE!!! They’re just so perfectly written I could cry!!!The way they’re also each others’ rocks?!?!Like Rhys being able to be himself and open up to someone for the first time and feeling so comfortable and feeling AT HOME with Bridget, made my heart beat a million miles per second!!!Same the other way around!! Bridget feeling so at ease with him and actually being able to lean on someone and getting supported by Rhys… It was just so endearing to see them both act so sweetly with each other! No (pure) romance book couple has ever lived up to their love (if you ask me)!!!!!Rhys is also the most perfect man ever!!! He’s definitely the best Twisted man and he might not be YOUR favourite but you can definitely admit that he is THE BEST out of all the Twisted men! Like the way he stood by Bridget no matter what, fought so strongly for their love and is willing to give up everything just to see her happy?!!! I’m crying, screaming…And HE DOES NO WRONG!!!! He didn’t need to grovel because HE IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE (if it isn’t obvious enough I’m pretty much in love with him lol)Anyway.. besides the romance, I loved the sub-plot of politics and monarchy! It was amazingly involved into the plot and just shows how corrupt the system can be (most definitely not only in fiction).Seeing Ava and Alex again, happy and together, was also so pleasing to read about and seeing the other characters as well was so endearing!Let’s just say I loved every second of this book and if you haven’t read it yet… GET TO IT NOW!!!!! It is worth EVERYTHING!!! Even if you may have disliked the first book, definitely give this one a try!!Overall, this will most likely always be my favourite romance book and Ana Huang book ever and I’m so glad to have read it not only once but twice!! And I’m already looking forward to rereading it again sometime in the future! I also can’t wait to reread Twisted Hate tomorrow!!",5
1108,"Twisted Games (Twisted, #2)",3 stars (max)Plots wise I loved this book! It made sense and the so called plot twist wasn’t out of the blue if you think about it. It made sense. It was a save plot line.I like Bridget. She is probably my favorite girl of the group because of how she holds herself but wow Rhys did indeed make me cringe almost all the time. Sometimes I was weirded out by how possessive he was and just how Bridget did anything he said.The growling and crawling just isn’t for me. These men are just weird.I also liked Christian in this book as well as a lot of the other side characters so this book was really pleasant to read and it wasn’t too fast but also not too slow.,3

Yes, it was cliche and tropey, but ask me if I care?!! NOT EVEN A LITTLE BC THAT SHIT WAS HOT! I loved the slow burn, the bickering, the banter, and then the absolute obsessive possessive man beast that is Rhys Larsen had me squealing. And Bridget, is my kind of girl! She has a SPINE and Rhys was not just going to talk to her any kind of way and I LOVED her. But their relationship was so balanced! It was hot but also sweet and endearing and supportive. I loved how they respected each other and were supportive of each other.I am actually really excited to read the other books now, but I don't know if another couple can beat Rhys and Bridget, they set a pretty high bar for me!",4

I was completely hooked even though the beginning felt so slow (it is a slow burn) but it picks up soon enough. One of my favorites in the twisted series — just think The Princess Diaries but with smut and a hot ass bodyguard 🥵,4
1117,"Twisted Games (Twisted, #2)","3.25 stars 👑Well, I liked this better than I expected. Going in with lower expectation was definitely the right choice so I ended up liking this a bit better than the first book.This book felt a lot less insta-love thanTwisted Love.That book was just too fast for me…the characters fell in love faster than I could give a shit about them so this book did much better at that. It’s still a bit fast, but in the book it’s technically not fast since this occurs in a 3-4 year time frame. What this book is, is insta-LUST to the motherfucking max. Our hero,Rhys Larsen, literally says in his inner-thoughts that he got a hard-on forBridget (h)the first time he met her.I’d guarded plenty of beautiful women before, but when I saw Bridget in person for the first time, I’d reacted in a way I never had for my previous clients. Blood heating, cock hardening, hands itching to find out how her golden hair would feel wrapped around my fist.Well alrighty then 😃This book sorta gave me vibes fromThe Bodyguardaka one of my favorite movies of all time. Especially since Bridget didn't like how Rhys was trying to change the way she lived her life. Like increasing her security and forcing her to not go to certain events because he didn't think he could do to keep her safeOr evenBodyguard, the tv seriesthis clip is spain without the 's'😔Imma be honest, I really liked Rhys.Is he super overbearing, overprotective, and constantly jealous? Hell yeah, but it kinda makes him spicy. His inner thoughts, before they develop a relationship, consist of him lusting over her and getting jealous if a man even looked at Bridgetexhibit a)If Bridget were anyone but my client, I’d drag her into the bathroom, bend her over, and spank her ass raw for her insolent tone.exhibit b)A muscle flexed in my jaw as Bridget’s laughter floated over, joined by Steffan’s deeper laugh, and the urge to murder someone—someone male with blond hair and a name that began with S—intensified.What was so fucking hilarious, anyway?”…""They make such a cute couple,” the reporter next to me, a curvy brunette in a bright pink suit that hurt my eyes, cooed. “Don’t you think so?”“No.”This mans inner-thoughts are freaking A-1, reeeal subtleI also loved that he wasn’t with another women at any point after him and Bridget met.I loathe when a hero likes the heroine and chooses to fuck around with other girls…like what was the reason.There’s also some super cute and sweet moments between the two of them.Like when Rhys doesn’t allow Bridget to go to a festival because he didn’t like the security of it so he builds an indoor “festival” in her house. He put up a tent, put out snacks and had the festival playing live on the TV. The cutest part is that he lied and said her friends put it together, but it was all him 🥺→Bridget and Rhys confessing their love for each other-“In Costa Rica, you asked if I’d ever been in love. I said no.”I lowered my head until our foreheads touched and her lips were scant inches from mine.“Ask me again.”…”Have you ever been in love, Mr. Larsen?”“Only once.”I slid my hand up from her neck to the back of her head, cupping it.“And you, princess. Have you ever been in love?”“Only once,”she whispered.→THIS SPEECH. RHYS STOP ✋🏻✋🏻✋🏻-“You filled a part of my soul I always thought would be empty, and you healed scars I never knew existed. And I realized…it’s not that I didn’t believe in love before. It’s that I was saving it all for you.”I MEAN REALLY 😭😭😭men written by women >Now, as far as the smut goes…PHEWWWW. The dirty talk was so fucking good by both Rhys and Bridget. Like I genuinely was surprised sometimes by the shit they said to each other.“Remember. In public, you’re my princess, but in private, you’re my whore…You’ll do what I say, when I say it, and you’ll take my cock however I want. Won’t you?”“Spread your legs wider. Let me see that pretty pussy dripping for me.”→He said this right after he made her wear a vibrator to a meeting with the King (her grandfather) and Parliament 🤪Can I just say something…WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE TIME JUMPS.Y’all know this, IHATEtime jumps with a deep fucking passion. For there to be aTWO YEARtime jumpTWENTY PERCENTof the way in the book should be a fucking crime. Also, 2 time jumps in one chapter and another the very next is RIDICULOUS.Also, Bridget’s brother Nikolai is a selfish POS.The way he just put everything on Bridget’s shoulders was so shitty. I can’t believe Bridget wasn’t angry as hell that her entire life was uprooted because Nikolai wanted to think about himself 🙄twisted series↠ #1twisted love—2 stars↠ #2 twisted games —3.25 stars↠ #3twisted hate—4.5 stars↠ #4twisted lies—4 stars",3
1118,"Twisted Games (Twisted, #2)","If PLEASURE why GUILTY?? 🤔🤔This book was much better than Twisted Love. Was it a good book? No, I wouldn't say so. After comparing this book to her King of Wrath, I've come to a conclusion that Ana Huang improved her writing A LOT. The writing style was much more lacking in this than the storyline itself. Putting that on the side for a second, I must point out, even though I had so much uni work to do and I haven't been in a reading slump as big as this one like ever???, being able to finish this in a reasonable amount of time and more importantly, being able to enjoy it is a win for me AND THIS BOOK.The first installment in this series, Twisted Love, was a huge let down for me back when I read it and I made a decision not to continue reading this series. But the plot does TWIST sometimes (pun intended) and I decided to give it a second chance. And I must confess, I'm glad that I did. Already knowing what I was getting myself into (a light fast-paced read) and not expecting too much, I found it really enjoyable. The book had its flaws, mostly in the character department (and if you've been following my reviews you know I'm a character-driven-book enthusiast) but in some other aspects too.As I mentioned above, writing style in this was objectively bad. There weren't, dare I say any???, good quotes, everything felt rushed and bland, just a very amateur approach to writing romance, especially ADULT romance. I keep pointing this out in many of my reviews, but I HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF AGAIN.Making. your. characters. 34 (or giving them any adult age idc). and. having. them. participate. in. explicit. sexual. activities. doesn't. convince. me. they're. adults!!! I can't stress this enough.I know that this series is insanely popular and it has a huge fan following, RHYS AND BRIDGET ACT LIKE CHILDREN, argue with the wall.The thing that bothered me the most, however, wasn't the writing, it was the TIME JUMPS. This was insane. I felt like this book was just a bunch of one-shots (by that I'm not talking about the smut but rather emphasizing how uncoherent the story was, it felt like a collection of short stories about the protagonists) and absurdly huge time jumps in between. Often times, I found myself really enjoying the story and the progression of it and then boom, A THREE-MONTH TIME JUMP that provided nothing but gave the author a chance to move on with the next plot point without building any relationships between the characters.The politics was also ridiculous but didn't bother me too much. I'm not a fan of politics in general and if I were, I wouldn't be reading Twisted Games, I would read a book on the royal family or whatever. Yeah...Believe it or not, this book also had some strong points. It was fast-paced, it was enjoyable, it was addicting, and it was a huge improvement compared to Twisted Love. I found myself rooting for the protagonists, gasping at the plot twist etc. It definitely motivated me to continue reading this series in hopes of finding an installment that I like the most.THE CHARACTERSBRIDGET ahhh my princess. Without spoiling anything about the changes in Bridget's life apart from the obvious, I must say that I really like this woman. That's not news, I like all Ana Huang women, the men are the problem for me. I liked Bridget more than I did Ava, her chapters were a breath of fresh air. To be completely honest with you, I liked her a lot, but I can't really explain to you why because she didn't have much substance, just like the rest of the character cast. Rhys painted her from a whole different perspective, but I loved her descriptions as much as I did reading from her POV. I wish we got more explanation on her career, I would love to have seen her do something unrelated to her romantic relationship. Also, her relationship with her brother Nikolai wasn't the best, having her trauma bond with him would make this book so much better in my opinion.RHYS was the reason this book wasn't rated lower and the reason for me to believe that Ana Huang has potential after all, just how Alex was the reason I hated the first book. Rhys was just so much better than Alex, even though he had his red flags (I talked about that in the updates). I'm not a fan of his relationship with Bridget, especially the portion of the story while they weren't romantically involved and he was just her bodyguard. He was jelaous and stupid??, bossing her around, telling her ""everything he does is for her best"" and using that as an excuse to be an absolute asshole. He forgot his place so many times that I had to remind myself he was her bodyguard. Changing that portion of the story, seeing his submissive side would make this story better BY A DEGREE (once again, argue with the wall). However, seeing Rhys's character development gave me peace and comfort, I loved his banter with Andreas and hints of a relationship with Nikolai.That's all for this review. Thank you for reading, 🤟❤️💋",3
1119,"Twisted Games (Twisted, #2)","I really fuckin enjoyed this!I wasn’t expecting it to go this way, since the first 40% or so of the story felt a bit meh. But I was anticipating this story since the first book came out. I was already rooting for Rhys and Bridget.The writing and some of the plot points slightly bothered me though. It bordered on cliche/cheesy at times (for my taste) and the writing wasn’t as polished as I would’ve liked. But I can see the potential Ana Huang has, because she definitely knows how to write a good story. I could not put this down once I got started!The time jumps was another element that bothered me. Whilst they were necessary to the story, I did not like the way it was handled initially. It interrupted the flow of the story for me. There was no natural progression into the time jump - it was just abrupt and the reader was just expected to go along with it.Despite all that though, I really liked the characters. A lot. I liked how this story progressed. The forbidden element was really honed in on, the angst was beautifully torturous, I loved that Bridget really took on the role of being a future queen. I wish we had more of that. And I loved that the age-gap wasn’t an issue. I mean, they had bigger shit to deal with but it never felt like a hindrance because our two main characters were so in tune with one another. Plus it helped that Bridget was actually mature.I just really enjoyed how this wrapped up overall. It got better and better as I read on.And don’t get me started on the steaminess. Lord…Bodyguard romances are definitely becoming a book-kink of mine. I want to read more books that include this particular trope.",4

In public, you’re my princess, but in private, you’re my whore.”I can´t believe I didn't read this book earlier. How did we go from our singer Alex to the hot ass bodyguard Rhys??Bridgett and Rhys are the pure definition of love, the way they had me giggling, blushing and running is unreal😩 I was hooked from the first second I began reading, the tension, the chemistry, the secrecy it was all just so good.

I'm debating between Twisted games and Twisted lies but I just can't figure out which one i like more.

It was something I'd heard of and not experienced, until I met a woman who cracked my ironclad defenses like no one had before.

1122,"Twisted Games (Twisted, #2)","|| 1.0 star ||This was insta-lust; nothing more. There were also constant, non-stop time jumps that made it completely impossible to actually see any (supposed) development between these two: It’s all tell, and no show. We never really went into detail in any conversation or situation: we literally glanced over everything.Also, Rhys was the most bland hero ever and Bridget had no personality either. All of their interactions honestly bored me to tears or simply just pissed me off. They had no chemistry at all.Part of me wanted to push her away from me, and another part wanted to drag her into my arms and keep her as mine. Except I couldn’t. Bridget was too young, too innocent and too off-limits, and I’d damn well better not forget that.So all in all, there simply wasn’t any depth to be found here, and neither did I see any actual love between them. Once they actually got together all they ever did was have sex. They had no emotional intimacy whatsoever.“Remember. In public, you’re my princess, but in private, you’re my whore.” His other hand reached down and pinched my swollen clit until I squealed, and the beginning tremors of an orgasm rocked through me. “You’ll do what I say, when I say it, and you’ll take my cock however I want. Won’t you?”“Yes,” I breathed.And don’t even get me started on the dirty talk or the weird power dynamics between these two during sex… Every time they were together in anintimateway I just had to cringe.“Keep your underwear, gloves and heels on, and crawl to me.”My breath gusted out in shock even as my core spasmed at the order. I’d never crawled for anyone in my life—while I was all but naked, no less. Even if I wasn’t the future queen, it would be degrading. Humiliating. Depraved. And I’d never been more turned on.I sank to my hands and knees, and I began to crawl.Lastly, the plot in this book was seriously as uninteresting and boring as humanly possible. I genuinely couldn’t care any less.'Twisted' series:1.Twisted Love- 3.5 stars2. Twisted Games - 1.0 star",1
1123,Mad Honey,"I have been devouring Jodi Picoult’s amazing books for years and honestly I missed the taste of her old books: thought provoking, earth shattering, twisty ones that shakes you to the core, testing your moral compass with unconventional plot lines! It seems like this book brings all of that precious taste of her old works back!Just like her old works Nineteen Minutes questioning school shooting, bullying, violence and Picture Perfect has a realistic approach to domestic violence, finally the Pact questions young teenage couple’s unconventional bound, Mad Honey is combination of all those amazing works with perfectly developed stories and unforgettable characters ! It rocks your world and makes you questions your own beliefs!When I reached the first half of the book I truly slapped against my face, after reading the big twist that I didn’t see it coming, I just shivered for a long time. I barely gathered my word after that jaw dropping moment!After that twist, the main focus of the book changes and story turns into really different direction. I’m not gonna give much away and keep one of the important subjects out in my review not to spoil the surprise.I decided to give a quick summary what I like this book at first besides amazing storytelling skills of Jodi Picoult and her brilliant co-authors who are brave enough to write about so many sensitive subjects and give a fresh, unique, bold approach to them.-the character development is perfect. It represent two survivor women who survived after being life changing tragedies.Olivia McAfee , single mother, survivor of domestic abuse, raising her son Asher by herself, inheriting her father’s beekeeping business, living peacefully and secluded life by leaving her old life behind.Lily Campanello: 18 years old, living her old life behind by moving in New Hampshire with her mother Ava who is always at her side, doing everything she can to give her daughter a life she dreams.I loved hear Lily’s voice and read about her fight against insecurities, her tough decisions. She’s so brave! She’s truly miracle!-I enjoyed to read the long depictions and elaborated information about beekeeping and nature of bees, the magical healing power of honey. It’s truly educational experience.-the murder mystery of Lily, thought provoking arguments about violence, toxic relationships, secrets we keep, how far a mother can go to protect her child were realistically discussed.Olivia did the right choice to leave behind her abusive husband, raising her son Asher alone. But what if she couldn’t prevent her son to become a version of his father. What if he’s inherited his violence tendencies.That “what if” part keeps you in your toes and wonder what actually happened to Lily. When you read her story moving backwards, you slowly gather the pieces of her life puzzle and you feel like tiny pieces of glasses keep stabbing you in the heart. You feel for her. You resonate with her strongly.This book is more than abuse, violence, murder mystery, depression. It’s about a person’s free right to CHOOSE! You can choose what’s best for you even though it means you’ll act against the wishes of close circle.-I’m so happy to see Jordan McAfee back. He was the lawyer of Peter Noughton at “19 minutes” book and I definitely recommend you to read because in my opinion it’s still my favorite book of the author. Now Jordan defends his own nephew and he’s doing his best to keep him out of the prison.My only hesitation about Lily’s POV was backwards storytelling style. It was confusing and it affected me to feel the true depth of Asher and her relationship’s evolvement.And I found the evidences against Asher at the murder trial a little circumstantial. It seems like they want to pin the murder on him because it’s always boyfriend!The mystery unresolved as I expected and guessed from the beginning but I had some second thoughts about the execution.I only cut half point for those two factors but I still round up 4.5 stars to 5 because this book and the characters are so powerful. My emotions are everywhere. I couldn’t give this amazing work less than five stars.Special thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group/ Ballantine for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
1124,Mad Honey,"I’m going to be in the minority here, but I didn’t love this book. This book started off super strong and I was super intrigued. I flew through the beginning and had a hard time putting it down. Then, it started adding in all these controversial, hot topics including LGBTQ, abuse, suicide, abortion, gender equality, and interracial couples. It felt like the authors were trying to add in any and every recent hot topic they could think of to this book, and it just didn’t set well for me. It was all too much and way too over the top. The storyline was okay, and the book was readable, but all these triggers brought the enjoyability factor way down. The book was a lot longer than it needed to be and very predictable. I did enjoy learning a lot of great information and facts about bees in this story. I normally love Jodi Picoult books, so I am bummed this one did not work out for me. If you are easily triggered, do NOT read this book.Thank you Net Galley, and Random House Ballantine, for a copy of this book in return for my honest review.",2
1125,Mad Honey,"Bees + Murder MysteryOlivia McAfee is starting over in her childhood home. She is reeling from her divorce, fleeing an abusive ex-husband.For once, Olivia is finally getting her feet under her. Her beekeeping business is finally turning a profit, and her teenage son is thriving. However, her world crumples when her son, Asher, is accused of murdering his girlfriend.Is Asher just like his father? Or did someone else commit this heinous crime?Do you know how excited I was to read Mad Honey? This was on my list of the most anticipated books to read for the last half of 2022! Last year, I read Wish You Were Here by Jodi Picoult, and I loved it!In Mad Honey, there are a lot of things to like. The prose is really spot on. It is highly readable with short sentences and short paragraphs. When I started to read this book, it felt like a breath of fresh air, and I really looked forward to reading it.Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan have mastered character development. These characters are not black and white, all good or all bad. Even while depicting the abusive relationship, they showed the loving moments as well as the more challenging aspects of the relationship. Some characters aren’t comfortable sharing their past. Some are still trying to come to terms with their own relationship to the past.Mad Honey is also an excellent pick for a book club. There are a lot of hot topics in this book, a great tool to start some engaging conversations.As far as the murder mystery, I really enjoyed this aspect of Mad Honey. At the beginning of the book, you start off with Asher as a suspect. However, as the book progresses, you discover that there are quite a few people who have motive.As much as I enjoyed this book, it is about 100 pages too long. Some parts are repetitious, where we are either told some facts several times or an event is mentioned and then told in much greater detail later. Mad Honey tries to be too many things and covers off too many relationships and topics, crams in too many factoids.The ending is also extremely abrupt.Overall, Mad Hone is a very interesting read with a twist that I didn’t see coming.*Thanks, NetGalley, for a copy of this book in exchange for my fair and honest opinion.Connect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInsta",4
1126,Mad Honey,"***IF WORRIED ABOUT SPOILERS -- DON'T READ MY COMMENTS***This is a DNF for me at 55%. I gave it a good solid chance but it lost me with each turn of events.The beekeeping descriptions in this book were wonderful. I learned a lot and enjoyed spending time with these characters.Then everything changes when a teen is found dead and another teen is accused of the murder.Yes I knew this was about a transgender person but I wasn’t prepared to learn about every drug, operation, etc that this teen went through before she even hit puberty. The descriptions of the surgery were really unnecessary.What was in this person’s heart, THAT I was interested in!!The author seems intent on adding every hot topic issue that she can into her plot.The parents of a friend are both female, so what? It had absolutely nothing to do with the story and yet she tells us numerous times that she has two moms. No relevance to the story at all.The judge is described as being black, having “dreds” and possibly being barefoot while in court?? What was the author trying to tell me, if anything?? Was this also necessary to the plot?What finally pushed this to the point of no return for me was when a character states:“I sometimes think there is something very Jesus-like about Charlie Brown – his heartbreaking patience, his endless suffering. You have to admit the show would have a very different ending if, after he and Linus bought the sad little Christmas tree, the other kids in the Peanuts gang came after them with a hammer and some nails.”I have nothing positive to say about this book. There are lots of 5* reviews out there and perhaps people like to be lectured to in their reading – I DO NOT!!I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through NetGalley.",2
1127,Mad Honey,"I never put spoilers in my book reviews, but I feel compelled to address something after reading this excellent novel. It’ll be at the very end of this review, it will be brief, and I won’t discuss specifics…but I need to bring up a topic after reading other reviews. I sincerely hope it won’t spoil someone’s reading experience.Olivia is a beekeeper with an 18-year old son named Asher. She’s divorced after a very abusive marriage to a doctor, and it’s been just her and Asher for years.Lily and her mother, Ava, relocate to the same town as Olivia and Asher. Lily is a senior, and has had a hard time of things at her previous schools.Asher meets Lily at school, and they quickly fall in love. Everything is perfect……until Olivia receives a phone call with news of Lily’s death. The death is suspicious, and Asher is instantly questioned by the police.He swears he would never hurt Lily, but can Olivia, his own mother, believe him?Everyone keeps secrets for different reasons.Now THIS is the Jodi Picoult I love! This novel reminded me of her earlier work that always left me on the edge of my seat, flying through the pages while reading the drama on the page…and also gaining some interesting knowledge on things I never even thought about. Picoult writes this one with her good friend, Jennifer Finney Boylan, and the joint project is seamless and smooth. I couldn’t put it down.There are different timelines, riveting characters, and thought-provoking topics. I was in for the whole thing, and I highly recommend…if you don’t consider some of the topics a “trigger”.Here is where I’ll discuss what I mentioned at the beginning.In addition to learning many things about bees (and actually finding it interesting), this book also discusses transgender people and identity. There are some reviewers who are rating it low because of that, saying that Picoult and Boylan are jamming the topic down the readers throats. To each their own. Nobody is MAKING anybody read this book. However, I was taken aback by some people listing this topic as a “trigger warning” just because they were uncomfortable reading about it or don’t agree with it. I personally don’t consider the topic a trigger warning. It’s a tough topic that plenty of people are at least somewhat ignorant about, but the ONLY thing I see it triggering in some of these reviews is HATE…and that doesn’t sit right with me. Picoult has always written about tough/touchy subjects, and she has also always done her homework. I personally think it’s wonderful that she and Boylan are educating more people about what it means to be transgender and figuring out one’s identity. I found it eye opening as well. So kudos to them!!As Picoult explains in the author’s note: “I am no stranger to hate mail - and I’m sure I’m gonna get plenty for this book…Difference is a construct…Sometimes making the world a better place just involves creating space for the people who are already in it.”Well said, IMHO.4.5 starsThank you to Ballantine Books for providing a widget of the ARC through NetGalley.

1128,Mad Honey,"Unfortunately, the synopsis for this book is very misleading. Yes, I suppose this book is about do-overs, relocating, and starting over- but it goes WAY deeper than that. In fact, I feel the authors should change the title of this book from Mad Honey, to Everything But The Kitchen Sink! Seriously, you are getting every single social issue and injustice in America right now being brought up in this long, drawn out, boring book. I’ve DNF’d this book at about 55%, because I can’t take it anymore. I will skim the last few pages to find out what happens, but at this point- I don’t really care.Since I do have my spoiler alert on, I will say this book is mainly about being transgender. That’s fine, because it’s obviously a topic that I probably need to educate myself on more- but I don’t feel the need to be lectured about it for almost 500 pages. And like I mentioned above, we also have every other social issue thrown in there as well- to the point where it just gets too overwhelming. We have domestic abuse/violence, emotional abuse, same sex marriage, asexuals, pansexuals, rape, abortion, racism, homophobia, etc… Trust me, I may have forgotten to list a few, but believe me when I say they are mentioned in this book.I’m sure I am going to get bashed in the comments for this review, but as I said the synopsis totally lied about this book. I was not in the mood for this right now, and may even be taking a break from Jodi Picoult for a while.However, I will mention that I did enjoy the character of Olivia and the chapters that corresponded with her. I enjoyed learning about bees, but the other half of the book that feels like a big huge lecture is not working for me. Maybe if this book was 200 pages shorter and not a lecture/biology lesson, I may have enjoyed it more.This book may be called Mad Honey, but I’m mad as heck that I read it!",2
1129,Mad Honey,"Dnf at 54%Started out strong so I’m giving it 2 stars…The author started throwing in all sorts of current issues with sexual gender, etc…Just not a book for me.Thank you to Netgalley and Random House Publishing Group-Ballantine for the ARC",2
1130,Mad Honey,"I received a free copy from Net galley for an honest review. I'll probably be in the minority but that said, I am a big Jodi Picoult fan. Read every book. For a talented author, she really missed the mark this time. We have every trending newsworthy issue in this book. I was really enjoying it until we hit abortion, transgender, lesbians, and spousal abuse, gender altering hormones with surgery to change your sex, accompanied by explanations of all. The plot was great until I was bogged down in a biology lesson. I read for entertainment and even murder couldn't save this train wreck. Don't waste your time on this one. I am sad to say I would give it a minus one star if I could.",1
1131,Mad Honey,"Jennifer Finney Boylan and Jodi Picoult are very talented authors who’ve used beautiful prose and compelling characters to tell a story that speaks to so many levels of the human condition. It’s heartfelt, vividly described and thoughtfully told.This is the tale of two moms and their children: Beekeeper Olivia McAfee, and her son, Asher, and Forest Ranger Ava Campanello, and her daughter, Lily, who’ve recently moved to town. When Asher and Lily become romantically involved, it seems like a match made in heaven and both moms are delighted to see their children so happy after overcoming past events. The bliss turns to a nightmare when Lily is killed and Asher is arrested as the prime suspect in her murder. Did he do it? That’s the mystery.Then “The Twist”.It’s aGREATtwist, and one I never saw coming. Even the topic that it addressed had me riveted, and I loved the four major characters. Lily and Asher were particularly well-portrayed. There’s a lot that was right and good with this book, but it did have a few downsides for me.Structurally, this is SO similar to Picoult’s last book,Wish You Were Here, only the focal point after the whopping twist has been switched out. In the last book, it was COVID-19, while a different topic takes the spotlight here. It's a timely topic, and I love that the authors did their research. I just felt at times like the mystery/courtroom drama got a bit lost in the info sharing after the twist. At 464 pages, it occasionally dragged, and I really didn't like how the ending was handled. It felt hypocritical and completely unbelievable, and left me a bit disappointed.Overall, I mostly enjoyed this. I initially rounded down due to the ending, but I've thought a lot about this book. I learned a lot and the story kept me turning the pages - isn't that what any of us hope for? If you enjoy books that deep-dive into current social topics in story form, you may enjoy this, though it does have serious triggers like multiple forms of relational abuse and suicidality.★★★ ½ (rounded to 4)Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine, NetGalley, and authors Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan for this ARC to honestly review. It’s due to be published October 4th, 2022.",4
1132,Mad Honey,"**Many thanks to NetGalley, Corina Diaz at Random House-Ballantine, and Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan for a gifted copy of this book! Now available as of 10.4!**""The secret weapon of mad honey, of course, is that you expect it to be sweet, not deadly. You're deliberately attracted to it. By the time it messes with your head, with your heart, it's too late.""Stirring, emotional, thoughtful, and BEAUTIFULLY penned! EASILY one of my top reads of 2022!Olivia has decided to start over...in her 40's. A tumultuous relationship with her husband, an attractive and 'well-respected' doctor, turned dangerous, and she made the difficult choice to take her son Asher away from the toxic situation and move back to her quiet New Hampshire hometown. She is even able to fall back into her father's business, beekeeping, and life settles into a comfortable rhythm.At Asher's school, a new student named Lily is looking for a fresh start too. When she meets Asher, the two form an instant bond, and young love quickly blossoms. Lily is vibrant, clever, and a talented cellist...but there is more to her life and her story than she has shared with most. After all of the strife from her past, Lily is hopeful that life is finally moving in a positive direction.UNTIL Lily is found dead...at the bottom of the stairs of her home....and Asher is the one who finds her.Now some questionable text messages point directly to Asher...and he is accused ofMURDER.Has Asher inherited his father's temper? What could have happened to interrupt this cosmic connection between two young loves? Can Olivia's brother Jordan McAfee, an attorney, clear Asher's name...or is he ACTUALLY guilty?There are four things I can ALWAYS count on when I pick up a book from Jodi Picoult:1) She has done her research.There are two main topics in this book (one revolves around bees, the other is tied to the twist in the book, so I won't discuss it here) but WOW. The attention to detail is simply stunning, every time.2) Her characters will grab me and hold on tight!Her writing is so effortless, so honest, and so REAL. Nobody ever feels contrived in her books.3) My heart will be torn into pieces. Potentially MULTIPLE times.and most importantly4) The twist? WillKNOCK MY SOCKS OFF!Mad Honey captured everything I love about Picoult and reminded me justHOW talentedshe truly is as a writer. After reading, I was stunned to look back and find out this book was so long (!)...THAT'Show good it is. I am very guilty of looking down at % on my Kindle, checking how long I have left in a chapter etc., but with this book, the only time I found myself doing that was to see if I'd have time to get through just a LITTLE bit more!I also applaud, and will continue to applaud, Picoult's unabashed dedication to writing thought-provoking, topical material that is also compelling fiction in and of itself.I don't know any author out there who can handle such myriad difficult topics with ease, but no matter her focus, she consistently delivers. I also think her discussions of an abusive partner wereFARand above another book of hers I've read handling the same subject, Picture Perfect, so that was another huge plus and shows that in 20+ years, she only continues to get better!I was dying to know what was going on with Asher and Lily at ALL times, and the narrative bops back and forth between the past (Asher and Lily's relationship and Lily's past, prior to moving to NH) and present (the trial and its aftermath) and I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the verdict. I didn't know this was going to have a legal slant to it, but it just helped to drive the narrative even more. Although the timeline could have been a little clearer, I was able to follow it pretty well for the most part. While the beekeeping portions got a bit wordy at times, I have to admit I learned SO much about honey (and was thinking of Jodi and Jennifer last night when I made a cup of tea!) ☕This was my first experience reading anything authored or co-authored by Jennifer Finney Boylan, but the work between these two authors was seamless. The authors referenced in their end notes about swapping back and forth who wrote which character and joked that even THEY would have trouble distinguishing each other's writing by story's end! If this is any indication of Finney Boylan's writing overall, I am a new fan of hers as well as Picoult!Mad Honey is a powerful and emotional tale of secrets and truth, bravery and honesty, and above all, finding the inner strength to live life FULLY, no matter how great the risk, and having faith in the reward.As one character observes,""Everybody is always still trying to learn, day after painful day, how to be themselves.""And then she adds…“I can't wait.""4.5 stars, rounded upNow a GMA Book Club pick, and now available in paperback as of 9.5.23!",5
1133,Mad Honey,"I can't recommend this novel that is only marginally related to the description and synopsis given by the publisher. I almost stopped reading when the big shocker appeared at the 45% mark and I realized exactly what this whole book was going to be about.Basically -- a lecture on every contemporary and controversial subject as the authors flex their virtue, tolerance, and understanding. You name it, this book has it: race, color, politics, the justice system, gender and sexuality, transgender, women's rights, spousal abuse, etc. If you like being told what to think and how to think, this is one for you. It's not that I agree or disagree with the authors, mind, it's that every single concept of diversity is all mashed up in this singular story. I wish that I could just read a great plot with characters I could imagine all on my own without the author describing things in such detail as often much of that has nothing to do with the actual point of the novel. Perhaps I am an outlier, but I am tired of books trying to push a social agenda, and I should have known better than to pick up this one as JP has often been a miss for me because she does it all the time. Sometimes those twists that get tossed in her books are just too much for me to tolerate.Despite how much I disliked the main narrative, the reason I gave the book two stars is because of the information about the bees. Now, that I found interesting. I like books with legal and courtroom drama, and I like a story with a medical slant, but some of that was quite obviously creative license. Anyway, I'm done and I think I can pass on any future books without FOMO.I would love to discuss this book with others, especially the fact that there is some discussion about whether or not someone should reveal the fact that they are transgender. For real? Anyway, I see mixed reviews for this book and glad that people feel comfortable sharing their opinions. Others have written their thoughts much better than I can, but I don't recommend it.Thank you to NetGalley and Ballantine Books for this e-book ARC to read and review.",2
1134,Mad Honey,"WOW!This one is a stunner and almost as good as my favourite by her,""Small Great Things.""The best part is that this one was a book that was co-written together with Jennifer Finney Boylan. You cannot tell which part is written by which author. Now that is a fantastic feat just in itself! It flowed THAT well!It's a story told in two voices. Olivia, is a single mother and a bee keeper. Her son Asher is 18 years old and his girlfriend is found dead. The other voice is, Lily, the girlfriend of Asher.I don't want to give anything away as I was totally stunned by the revelations. What a thought-provoking, and powerful story this turned out to be. I felt the emotions and it even had me in tears at some points. This is an important story that everyone in this world should read and try to UNDERSTAND with COMPASSION!This was brilliantly written and half way through my reading of this my library audio became available. I can say it is written and narrated beautifully. Either way is just as compelling. Definitely one of my favourites for 2022. I will now check out Jennifer Finney-Boylan's books as well. Both author's notes at the end are a must-read!I'd like to kindly thank NetGalley and Penguin Random House Canada for granting me access to this Advance Reader Copy.",5
1135,Mad Honey,"4.5 stars, rounded downI’m always a little leery when a known author partners up with someone else. Is it the start of a James Patterson money grab? But no worries here. As told in the Authors’ Note, the idea was actually Boylan’s idea.This story is about identity, abuse and starting over. Olivia leaves her abusive surgeon husband and moves to New Hampshire with her son. She moves into her parents’ house and takes over her dad’s apiary. Lily’s mom leaves her husband who has been emotionally abusive of Lily. They move from the west coast to the same small NH town. Things seem to be going really well as Olivia’s son, Asher, and Lily become romantically involved. And then Olivia gets a call that Asher is at the police station and Lily is dead. At the beginning, I was worried this was going to be more of a straight mystery, but it’s not. The time frame goes back and forth, before and after Lily’s death. At times, this gets a bit confusing as Lily’s story is told in reverse. But I loved the story’s message and how it deals with identity - how we see ourselves and what it means to truly see someone else. It also deals with trust.As with Picoult’s other books, there are ample facts sprinkled into the story. Often, they’re about beekeeping. But Picoult also uses Lily’s love of facts and list making to throw additional facts in concerning all sorts of sundry items.I adored each of the main characters and have a true book hangover now that it’s over. Like Boylan writes in her note, I wasn’t ready to walk away from them.My thanks to Netgalley and Ballantine Books for an advance copy of this book.Note - I just heard on the news that the Royal Beekeeper informed the bees of the Queen’s death.Update : an interesting interview with the authors:https://www.bookbub.com/blog/jodi-pic...I just re-read this for my book club and it was just as good the second time, even when I knew the ending. And it made for one of the best book club discussions we’ve had in a long time.",4
1136,Mad Honey,"omg. not me actually liking a JP novel!? 😂jokes aside, i think this is a pretty high quality book. the story brings a lot to the table and i can see it making its way into several book clubs because of how much content there is.for me, i really enjoyed the legal side of things. i loved reading the courtroom scenes and seeing the story unfold by way of confessions. but i also really like that goes beyond the mystery of how/why did lily die. this book is quite long, but thats because so much time is taken to really develop the characters in a way where you they feel like real people, causing the reader to become invested in the result of the court case.overall, i think this is a pretty great read!↠4.5 stars",4
1137,Mad Honey,"Whenever Jodi Picoult writes a new novel, I know that I am going to read it, once again she brings her laser attention to issues at the forefront of our contemporary world, and once again impresses with the depth of her research. This book she has written with Jennifer Finney Boylan, not an author I am familiar with, and their partnership works well together here as they profoundly and movingly explore the hot topics of the complexities of gender and identity. Olivia McFee leaves behind her apparently perfect life in Boston with her surgeon husband, it was little more than a shimmering mirage, taking her son, Asher, and returning to her quiet hometown of Adams, New Hampshire, living in the house she grew up in, and taking over her family beekeeping business, hoping for a fresh beginning.Lily Campanello and her mother, Ava, relocate to Adams, New Hampshire, for her final year of high school, they too are hoping to leave behind their past for a new start. 18 year old Asher and Lily's paths cross when Asher falls for the new girl in school, and Lily can’t help but fall for him, too. The pair are happy to have found each other until Asher shockingly discovers Lily's dead body, and Olivia cannot believe it when her good and kind son is charged with her murder. However, the thought crosses her mind of the echoes of her abusive husband's temper present in Asher. This is a coming of age story that goes back and forth in time, with all the intensity of a teenage romance, all the tensions and suspense of a murder mystery and a courtroom drama to boot amidst a challenging narrative of secrets, lies and deception.This is a compulsive novel that is best approached knowing as little as possible to feel the full emotional impact of the twists and turns coming, and the heartbreak, oh, and I must mention the return of Jordan McFee. Some of the highlights include the rich descriptions and details of the beekeeping business, including the healing powers of honey, and how a woman can end up in an abusive relationship. Whilst there were so many aspects of this riveting novel I loved, I do have to say there were occasions when I felt an overload from the sheer numbers of issues that were raised. However, shining through is the humanity, acceptance and compassion, and which, along with the characterisations, make this a terrific, timely and informative read of love, grief, love, loss, gender, abuse and family. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC.",4
1138,Mad Honey,"4.5*Like bees to honey, I’m always drawn to Jody Picoult’s books!Olivia is raising her son Asher on her own having left an abusive marriage. She’s relocated back to her hometown to take over the family business of beekeeping.🍯🐝As with all of Jody Picoult’s books, she thoroughly researches the subject matter. In this case, it’s running a bee farm. You’re given a real education of what takes place in order for us to have that heavenly jar of honey on our breakfast table.Asher is in the midst of falling hard in love with Lily. Young love, first love. And emotions running rampant. Especially when certain secrets are being kept from one another. So when Lily is found dead, naturally all eyes turn to Asher.Though beekeeping plays a central role in this book, there is SO much more. But like Lily, I must keep it a secret and let you uncover it all on your own. The less you know going in the better.This was a collaborative effort with Jennifer Finney Boylan. I found the notes at the end of their book regarding their partnership in writing together fascinating.Jody Picoult has a true gift for writing and I’m so pleased to have many of her previous books on my shelf just waiting for me.Wish You Were Herestill remains a favorite, one that I cannot stop thinking about.I will now have to delve into JFB’s backlist too!Thank you to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group Ballantine .",4
1139,Mad Honey,"This book was a total waste of my time. It started out ok but soon turned into a preachy agenda based story that hit practically ALL of today’s controversial trendy issues…and then tried to consistently make laborious analogies to bees and musical instruments. If you believe that adults should help young children take the steps to change their gender as children, then this book may be for you. If you don’t mind reading derogatory and irreverent references to the Bible, then this might be a book for you. It was not a book for me. I found it contrived, agenda based, and depressing.",1
1140,Mad Honey,The reason I’m giving this book one star is because you go in thinking it’s about one thing and 45% of the way through it drops a bomb and the story becomes all about something else entirely. It’s a hot topic right now that is controversial and it’s not mentioned at all in the burb.,1
1141,Mad Honey,"5+ stars! Outstanding!2022 Favourites List!Shocking and emotional. Heartbreaking and eye-opening. Thought-provoking and inspiring.Want to meet characters you’ll never forget? Read this book. Want to open your mind and heart? Read this book. Want to challenge your thoughts and pre-conceived judgements? Read this book. Want to explore current, relevant, important worldly topics? Read this book. Want to educate yourself and challenge bias? Read this book. Want to feel something? Read this book. Want to be forever changed? Read this book.Jodi Picoult is a long time favourite author of mine. When I heard she was co-authoring this latest novel, I was somewhat hesitant as I felt it couldn’t possibly be a seamless piece of work and completely live up to her standard. Lucky for me, a gorgeous gifted finished copy landed in my mailbox from the publisher which gave me the push I needed to read it. Two words: Life changing!I’ve read all of Jodi’s books and can honestly say, this is one of my top 3 of hers. I’m forever changed after reading this. Thank you to Jodi and Jennifer for writing this important and informative book. Thank you for challenging my thoughts and biases. Thank you for putting me in others shoes to explore and form more educated opinions. Thank you for pulling my heart into this story and making me ‘feel’.I won’t comment on anything to do with the synopsis other than bees and beekeeping are a subtopic. The beekeeping world held very little appeal to me before reading this, so if you feel similar to me, please don’t let that deter you from this highly impactful and truly unforgettable story. In true Jodi Picoult style, I was fascinated by the beekeeping facts and amazed at how it could be related to many life topics. My suggestion to you is DO NOT READ REVIEWS before picking this up as I fear you may see spoilers which will take away from your reading experience. There are several heavy and sensitive topics explored within these pages but these topics need the reader to be unaware going in. Not for shock factor, but simply so the reader can grow with the characters in the story instead of knowing what to expect.Upon finishing this novel, my heart is full, sad, open, hopeful. I didn’t want this story to end. Bottom line: this is a must read book that is a top 2022 read for me. It’s a highly controversial and incredibly important read.Thank you to the publisher for my gifted physical copy!",5
1142,Mad Honey,"UPDATE BELOW….Review soon…..about a 3.5 rating ….rating up to 4 stars…..I’ve a lot to say …..I enjoyed it —I recommend it —I bet it was fun to ‘friendship-bond’ write it….And…..I have a healthy dose of kind-hearted criticismBut need a break …I’ll return to share deeper thoughts of what did and did not fully work for me soon.…..haha, I just wrote 3 book reviews in one sitting….(give a girl a rest break)….lolThe last four days —- I’ve been reading around the clock - - but haven’t been online until now. I didn’t have the energy for anything but reading or sleeping.I did something stupid which caused a yucky head injury.I feel asleep in the pool while reading my kindle. Then knocked my head so hard — I almost knocked out completely.My body went into a shock and chills ….so I hadn’t left my bed until today….Much better now — but my huge black and purple swollen right eye is a sore sight to see.Move over ROCKY.Review “Mad Honey” soon. (good pick for a book discussion — but in my opinion ‘not’ FOR the obvious reasons)…. but for ‘equally’ what was missing - things that didn’t tie together - as much as the many topics - themes - and issues that are worthy to examine)NEW UPDATE:Update: LONG but NO SPOILERSFirst and foremost….overall I enjoyed ‘Mad Honey’….I liked the wide variety of themes and issues explored —At the same time….….I felt the crafting was lukewarm….pieced-together (perhaps collaborationist challenges), rather than seamless prose.Not all important issues were fully explored.TWO eighteen year olds attempted suicide —ONE abusive husband was still out on the street practicing medicine,AND….….a young seemingly innocent kid might very possibly go to prison accused of killing his girlfriend —YET….with so many other competing subplots (interesting for the sake of general interest but the sensory overload is noticeable), ….beekeeping, (details among details), honey remedies, single parenting, family relationships, schoolwork, artwork, hockey, cello playing, ovulation of a baby panda, a little Aristoto, an education about animal species that change sex, hate crime, Transgender identity, vulnerability and hate, a sister-in-laws surgery, a sister-in-laws common cold, classmate friendships, secrets, lies, withholds……THIS reader began to wonder — what’s the main dish being served up? Or was it a picnic potluck affair?It’s okay….I like potluck too …..so this is not all negative…..but in the same way I get too full - if not careful at a potluck gathering….I was starting to feel quite full indeed.Lost my taste for honey, thank you. LolAnother theme barely developed:….We learn that Olivia McAfee left her abusive husband. (The abusive descriptions were graphic). There was not an ounce of criminal punishment charged against Braden. He was still a practicing cardiologist. I wondered in what world should this scenario be okay?Braden lived in Boston a couple of hours from New Hampshire …(with his new wife, Margot, and their twin boys, Shawn and Shane - 8 years of ageOlivia and her son Asher moved (back to hometown) New Hampshire after leaving Braden. Olivia took over her grandfathers beekeeping business. It had been 12 years since Olivia had any relationship with Braden. She was granted custody of Asher.Lily Campanello was a new student at Adam’s High School in New Hampshire. She and Asher fall in love with each other. Both are eighteen years of age.Lily dies. Asher is accused of killing her.The courtroom scenes were judiciously played out. So no qualms from me here — I enjoyed this story when we were in the courthouse.….the crime procedural thrill, cross-examinations tensions, and the elements of persuasion were exciting. The high stakes murder investigation was riveting — right up to and the wait for the verdict.BUT….Here again….…I wondered why it was necessary to mention that Jordan (defense attorney), had once been married - had another son, Thomas….(we learn nothing else of importance about this information)…before his marriage to Selena - and was she Black? I think so — which was fine with me — but the writing was so covert — I was not completely sure.Another tidbit…….a classmate friend of Asher, had two moms. I wasn’t sure why it was even mention — what was the issue? There was none! Simply a droplet-detail to keep readers awake - why mention the relationship of two parents from a minor character whom they themselves were invisible in the entire story?As for the ending? Want my real personal truth?I felt it was a copout ending. I won’t say more — other than for a book packed filled with plots, excessive drawn-out-subplots, themes, issues, (twists that some readers thought were shocking)…..it was a pretty dull ending….safe….non-committal type ending.NOTE — personally I didn’t find any major twist in this novel. Many reviewers mentioned there was a huge twist in the middle.Personally — I didn’t read it as a TWIST at all…..rather….it was simply natural character unraveling….…..revealing another layer of character secrecy…or perhaps privacy is a better word. But a major TWIST?I actually find the word twist to be a little insulting for the situation we were presented with.So written without flaws? No….But SO WHAT….…..because …I agree with all the other readers who found “Mad Honey” enjoyable. I did too.I even took away value from aspects that didn’t work well for me…..as they caused me deeper….and gave me an opportunity to chat about them with a friend (thank you Karen).Ending on a positive note ….there were wonderful excerpts that stood out.Here are a few that spoke to me:“The times I’ve been slightly psychotic about my appearance, my figure. The assumption that I’m “the weaker sex” instead of a bee keeper who can lug a forty-pound box across several acres without breaking a sweat. All the times I’ve had to live up to those standards of men—and had to remind myself that those standers are bullshit”.“I hate that being female is equated with being frail, and yet, I’m proof of it. I’d let myself become Braden’s victim because of messaging I’d received my whole life: that it was my job to take care of my husband, that if something was wrong it was because I’d somehow failed at my job. I’m ashamed to admit it, but there were times—even as a feminist—when I bought into seeing that as my role”.“Sometimes I think, if you’re not really sad in this world, you’re just not paying attention”.“It takes a dozen bees to gather enough nectar to make a teaspoon of honey, each of them alighting on roughly 2600 flowers and flying 850 miles back and forth. A worker bee weighs little more than a breath—100 milligrams—but she can carry half her body weight and nectar”.“People want the world to be simple. But gender isn’t simple, much as some might want it to be. The fact that it’s complicated—that there’s a whole spectrum of ways of being in the world—is what makes it a blessing. Surely nature—or god, or the universe—is full of miracles and wild invention and things way beyond our understanding, no matter how hard we try. We aren’t here on earth in order to bend over backwards to resemble everybody else. We are here to be ourselves, in our gnarly brilliance”.Final words (ha….as if this review wasn’t long enough)….Enjoyable…..written with heart!Two young teens in love…Parents who love their kids…Families, communities, acceptance, sadness, grief, death, tragedy & ugliness, loss, and an abundance love.It must’ve been a blast for Jodi and Finney to work on this book together. A win in itself.",4
1143,Mad Honey,"I typically love Jodi Picoult's books. She creates memorable characters who are embroiled in current social issues. This book certainly lives up to her reputation, but I didn't love it. Frankly, I am tired of having the whole transgender issue flaunted in the media. I especially find it distressing when children are involved. Maybe I am old fashioned, but I think some decisions should not be made until an individual is much older. I won't be recommending this book.I received an ARC from the publisher through NetGalley. The opinions expressed in this review are solely my own.",1
1144,Mad Honey,"Wow. 5 stars for the idea. I love a good murder mystery!! The first 45% of the book is all mystery and intriguing - I had to know what happens. And then the twist. A transgender girl (not woman).This book is most likely purposefully not advertised as LGBTQ so that more people will read it.The political agenda was INTENSE once you find out Lily is transgender. The child abuse in this story is unreal - allowing your child to take hormone blockers at age 12 and mutilating their body at 16 is absolutely horrific. Can we please stop beautifying this transition??? A child at the age 3 or 4 cannot possibly identify with one gender or the other, they hardly know how to use the toilet!!! The fact that Picoult and Boylan write this making it all seem so miraculous and beautiful is awful. The authors also take on a lot of intense and heavy topics - suicide, domestic abuse, feminism, LGBTQ, abortion, etc. which is a lot for just one book.Does it mean we should treat trans people horribly like they are treated in the book? Absolutely not. But turning it into a work of fiction to make it all seem so glorious is disturbing. I would love just a fantastic work of fiction without the political stuff being shoved down my throat.",1
1145,Mad Honey,"Like some of the people who did not love this book (Please dont come at me im part of them. 🙏🏾) I too found that it contains way too many heavy topics, all you can think of first is probably in there. (Suicide, murder, transgender, transphobia, domestic violence, abuse and it goes on…) It was too much to take in, the various topics explained in extended details while not really being relevant to the plot.It was fine learning about bees but it felt too much like taking a class, it might have been better if it was placed as extras at the end of the book like all the honey recipes. I also thought the same thing with some of the other issues in the book.I was not a fan of the story’ structure, one part is told by Olivia in present time/flashbacks and the other by the victim, Lily, in reverse time, it felt strange and added nothing to the the plot. I didn’t affectionate any of the characters and the end was disappointedly flat and more or less predictable for a murder mystery.",3
1146,Mad Honey,"(free review copy) Yes I know Jodi Picoult is a mega-author and I know who her co-author is for this book. And yes I know that many readers will cling to that and shout about how amazing this book is and that’s totally their right. But it was NOT a great read for me. The structure was a hot mess and I honestly can’t figure out why they had the timeline jumping backwards like it did - there was no functional purpose for it. The huge reveal halfway through the book pissed me off because I HATE gender and sexuality being used as a “gotcha” moment. It cheapens the issue and turns it into a party trick when instead I wish it could have been known from the first page, making it an integral and rich part of the story rather than just a possible reason for murder. I connected with zero of the characters and thought the bee connection was loose at best. The book was at least 100 pages too long and the ending was rushed and a disappointment.CW for domestic abuse, transphobia, beating because of transphobia, parental rejection",2
1147,Mad Honey,"Olivia and her son, Asher, have been on their own for twelve years, ever since Olivia had the courage to leave her cardiothoracic surgeon husband with a dark side and return to where she grew up, taking up the reins of raising bees and expanding the enterprises. It’s still not a lucrative living, but it’s quiet and Asher is doing well these days, playing varsity hockey.Ava and her daughter Lily have also come to this small town to leave secrets behind. Seniors Lily and Asher hit it off right away, but no relationship is perfect. When Lily is found dead at the bottom of the stairs by Asher, the prosecution assumes that an angry, volatile boyfriend is to blame. Initially, Olivia is certain her son isn’t responsible, but then she wonders if his father’s temper may have been passed on—maybe leaving when he was 6-years-old wasn’t soon enough to change his behavior. Because Olivia has moments of doubt, we, the readers have moments of doubt, and the first half of the book is tense. The second half of the book I realized I wasn’t going to get anything else done until I found out how things resolved, and I couldn’t put it down until I knew.This is a wonderfully written book, but one thing that didn’t ring true to me was that Olivia's ex, Braden, didn’t fight for custody of his son. Men like that think of children and wives as property, and even if he didn’t want to raise Asher, he would have fought. Instead, he lets them be and dutifully pays child support each month. Other than that, I found this compelling and at times heartbreaking, because the bad things that happen to these characters might be fictionalized for the novel but happen in one way or another every day in real life.I wouldn’t read too much about this book before you devour it. Just see the name Jodi Picoult and have faith that this is going to be great, which it is.Thanks to NetGalley for the opportunity to review this novel, which RELEASES OCTOBER 4, 2022.",5
1148,Mad Honey,"I respect and appreciate the position and perspective the authors took in telling this story, especially in light of the contemporary idea that everything and everyone needs to be completely transparent. There is a difference between secrets and privacy, and privacy and dishonesty and Picoult and Boylan had me thinking about layers: layers of discrimination, layers of truth, and layers of right and wrong and ultimately what defines this or that.I once read that a certain generation likes to apply labels to people, and while I can't say if it is truer for that generation, I do see how it is true for all of us to varying extents. Much of it is learned and often those labels can be a positive way to differentiate people. But are all labels necessary or helpful? The quick judgements we make about others are often based on what we see on the outside, not the person they are on the inside. We label differences in negative terms instead of recognizing the positives of uniqueness. But in the end, it shouldn't even matter. People are who they are and we all want to be accepted just as we are. Let's endorse positive descriptive labels and celebrate humankind in all shapes and forms, and let's oppose destructive labels that only serve to bully, harm, or exclude.This complex novel covers many discussion-worthy topics and dispenses a mini-lesson on beekeeping and all together makes for an absorbing read.",4
1149,Mad Honey,"Do overs, new beginnings, and young love.Olivia McAfee moved back to her hometown with her son, Asher, after leaving her husband. Never in her wildest dreams did she think that she would be back and running her father's beekeeping business. But it has given her a chance for a new beginning.Lily Campanello is a teenager who is starting over after moving to Adams, New Hampshire to finish her final year of high school. She is hoping that this new beginning will give her a chance to start over.Lily and Asher meet, and Lily is happy, but their relationship has its ups and downs and is not always pleasant. Then Olivia is informed that Lily is dead, and her son Asher is being held by the police for questioning.Whew! Picoult and Boylan have written a thought provoking, moving and captivating tale about secrets, the past, starting over, love and being yourself.Picoult and Boylan obviously did a lot of research or maybe one of them (or both) keep bees. Either way, readers will learn a lot about beekeeping amongst other things in this book that I will not give away. This book is relevant and packs a punch.With all Picoult's books this was well written and thought out. I also did not see the reveal coming! I had my theories and did not get it right. But I love being surprised and the authors pulled it off.Thank you to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine, and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

1150,Mad Honey,"Good lord, you can tell this was written by 2, very white, very earnest, liberal women. I prefer materials a bit more nuanced. This read like a ""very Special"" episode from an 80's sitcom. And it was at least 200 pages too long. I bet it is very difficult for people to critique this honestly, because there is such a high chance you will be ""cancelled"" given the subject matter. I knew who killed the girl within in first half of the book, but all of the overwrought histrionics overshadowed that this was suppose to be a thriller/murder mystery type book. EVERY SINGLE SOCIAL ISSUE was covered here. Very heavy-handed I might add. Domestic violence, racism, child abuse, interracial relationships, homophobia, abortion, suicide, transphobia, all checked off with a self-satisfied smile from the authors, assured of their ""teaching"" the ignorant masses a lesson. *EyeRoll* I detest books assuming I cannot reach my own intelligent conclusion to a story. Please DON'T force-feed me. Yuck.",1
1151,Mad Honey,"My favourite Jodi Picoult since Small Great Things. Emotional, heartfelt, compelling, and thought-provoking with some whopper twists. Contemporary drama, YA, courtroom drama, and mystery, and as you would expect from Picoult dealt with relevant, important serious social issues. If Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boulanger ever collaborate in the future I’m here for it. Mad Honey ticked all the boxes for me.",5
1152,Mad Honey,"I was so surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. The writing and plot was a lot more like Jodi's older books and I loved it! The plot line of this story was good and the characters very well developed. I smiled from ear to ear to have Jordan and Selina back and ready to take on a nerve wrecking case. The dual timelines really focused this story and I appreciated the insights it gave of what Lilly has gone through her whole life. That little twist in the middle was at the precise right moment and really gave that ""stop and reflect"" feeling.A really good book and very well researched. Loved it!Thank you Netgalley and Hodder & Stoughton for the opportunity to read and review this ARC.",4
1153,"Love, Theoretically","edit:the word 'big' in relation to jack was mentioned 12 times which is 11 times too oftenBefore I even think about starting this review I need you to know two words:lesbiansandSTEMDo I have your attention now? I should hope so because those two words are going to blow your fucking mind.i need you all to know and advocate forGeorge and Dorato get thier own romance book written by Ali herself,they are the most iconic people ever. George (Georgina) is a awesome physics women in stem and Dora makes souvolaki, people who know how to make suvolaki are next level cool. Nothing can change my mind.AND George is friends with Bee from Love on the Brain,HELLO Bee and Levi cameo.We can have a STEM Cinematic Universe where the character are all friends in some way. That would be epic. But im getting carried away.We need to advocate for a queer queens to get therelesbian women in stem romance.I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE no you dont understand its not a want, but a needSo, with that out of the way onto what you are actually here for, my thoughts on the books. And imma tell you right now that they are messy. Like toddler painting kinda messy.Sograb your popcorn, take a seat in front of the fire and let's get ready to RUMBLLEEEE*at this point imagine two boxers in a fighting ring, both representing my differing opinions*Okay so first lets not start with the positive because pshhh that soooo boring so lets start with what I found similar to the other two books which is an overarching theme in the Ali Hazelwood Cinematic Universe.Honestly, it's not as similar as i thought it would be (referancing my previous review down bellow)butwith that said there were still a heap ton of tropes and similarities to her other books.Lets have a chat about aroace chat and the spectrum hmn. I have noticed ali includes this in almost all of her novels. It was included inThe Love Hypothesisand god forbid we mention that sex scene inUnder One Roofit still remains with me no matter how much i try to purge it from my brain. And now im this book, now i am no expert when it comes to aroace rep but i feel like she always goes with the: ‘ive never wanted to have sex i dont know whats wrong with me’ line and that is so wrong.Now, there is one word that i cannot get behind and that is the use of the word “Daddy” I hate it so much. And i sould not be reading the word ‘daddy’ in a science romance book! It is simply unnacpetable and Iwill notstand for it. It was used inLove on the Brainand now this book. It will stop with this book. You hear me Ali Hazelwood?From me to you, we can both agree that miscommunication and down to earthstupidityis something we both wholeheartedly hate right? Yes well, funny you should agree because in this book and inLove on the Brainthe male love interest very patently tells them: “I DO NOT hate you I AM NOT WHO I WAS ALL THOSE YEARS AGO” somehow the amazingly smart and illtellegent women in stem still think these men hate them after literallythree whole freeking pagesof him telling her he doesnt and how he felt the entire trajectory of their relationship (from meeting to current) and i swear to you all the girls brain power must be directed towards academic because the havenone, nada, ZEROemotional intellegence EVEN AFTER BEING TOLD STRAIGHT TO THERE FACEWoah, this really rubbed me the wrong way, because it happened in TWO BOOKS and the guy is always so patient and nice. If i was in the situation god knows what I would do. Screw their heads on straight probably. They definatly need it.We all know that Ali Hazelwoodlovesto tell us every.single.page that the love interest is big and tall and ginormous and takes up all space. Granted she still did it here but toned it downa lotmy personal favourites were:“like how could i miss him when hes standing next to Adam Carlson. Theyre the Mount Rushmore of STEM academia”“He is……well, he is big. And well muscled, very well muscled”And saving the best for last:“His giant paws tightened around me”Think about that for a while won’t you?Lets talk about what I liked hmn? Why don’t you refil your popcorn and water you’ll be needing it.So, the thing I loved the most is that I had fun. I had so much fun reading the physics jokes and the story as a whole. The writing was so much better than her previous books. Praise the lord that they both had a personality and we got to know stuff about them (i didnt even know Adam was an evolutionary biologist until this book(how freaking cool is that as a job? OgkjdfjefbdhbdhjskI would kill to talk to someone with his knowlege and intelligence) like that's how little we got told about Adam) but in this book we got Jack's job upbringing and morals. It was good to have a more layered story than usual and still have fun. Usually Ali throws tropes into a mixing bowl and hopes for a delicious cake but thankfully it was a flowy story and that was not the case. InThe Love Hypothesisthere was trope after trope, as if to make readers happy and it did but gosh there was a lot jam packed in there.George was my favouite character of this entire book. She's my idol in life. She has many publications in physics, is super cool and has a wife that can make souvlaki. Now if you cant tell i really live Dora and George and i need their story now. I am deeply in love with both of them.I loved Elsies character development from extreme people pleaser(coming from a people pleaser) to her own person. It was so fun to see, especially with Jack helping her and calling her bullshit out.My most favourite thing of all was ofc the cameo from Adam and Olive and the friend group with all the cool science people.thatin my opinion was the best part of the bookand that's why we need a george and Dora book so we can have more of thatNow that all the boring stuff is out of the way let's get into what I didnt like because this is the real juicy stuffIhatedthe main characters actual name: Jonathan, but only because thats name of a close relative of mine and it's weird to read a romance with their name in itAnd that name? Jack Smith? I still stand by my clain that that sounds like the most old white man that throws money at stuff to make it go away guy. Honestly add some spice, some paprika, lemon peper, cinnamon to make it taste better on the tongue.I got the scene, that as a millennial Ali was trying to be ‘hip’ and be ‘down wid it’ as the first few chapters really showed meIn the very first chapter we got told her favourite movie was Twilight (pop culture reference is not good, we dont like that) and honestly her professor should have failed him because she liked twilight. I strongly dislike that movie and so personally i agree with the proffesor. there i said it. and yk what idc if its wrong.I think Ali is trying to live through her characters, I can see her personality come through her books and not in a good way. She includes ‘quirks’ because women in stem have to be unique and quirky. (as a woman in stem i can tell you i'm not. I read, study, and listen to Taylor Swift. So not very quirky at all) There was a quote she put in that made me feel like Ali was justifying her opinions:”Not that there would be anything wrong: sex work is legitamite work, and people that engage in it are just as deserving of respect as ballerinas, or firefighters or hedge fund managers”I mean she's not wrong, but we didnt need to include it in a romance novel did we? So that's now my biggest problem, that she includes her own shit into romance novels. but i guess thats how i perceve it. Like social issues in books i dislike because i want a whole different world without all the shit that happens in this book.NB: Riddle me this: miss people pleaser can't tell her best friend her favourite movie was twilight but can tell her client???Okayyyy, I think I'm done, now get up and stretch your legs, it's been a long read. Go to the wharepaku (toilet) and i will leave you with this:we need lesbian women in stem romance book, george and Dora are right there Ali, USE THEM.....{About this review below, yes it was insensitive for me to write a review before I read a book, but it was my opinion from reading the blurb so I am not sorry I did it}{this review is based off the synopsis i have not been given an arc}I asked and Miss Hazelwood did not deliver.This book looks like an exact carbon copy of Love on the Brain and The Love Hypothesis mashed together""Rival physicistscollide in a vortex ofacademic feuds and fake dating shenanigansin this delightfully STEMinist romcom""Sound familiar??In The Love Hypothesis Adam and Olive fake datedIn Love on the Brain Levi and Bee were rivals in collage""By day, she’s an adjunct professor, toiling away at grading labs and teaching thermodynamics in the hopes of landing tenure. By other day, Elsie makes up for her non-existent paycheck by offering her services as a fake girlfriend""Again InLove on the BrainBee was a scientist by day and a social media STEM infulence by night. Seems like all her characters have two 'personas'Jack Smith,the annoyingly attractive and broodyolder brother of her favorite client, turns out to be thecold-hearted experimental physicist who ruined her mentor’s career and undermined the reputation of theorists everywhereagain, sounds familiar??In The Love Hypothesis Adam was known for turning people thesis down because 'they wernt good enough' he was known as cold hearted and scary.In Love on the Brain, Bee thought Levi ruined her career.Also what kind of simple ass name is Jack Smith, please choose something more interesting for flavour.Elsie is prepared for an all-out war of scholarly sabotage but…those long, penetrating looks? Not having to be anything other than her true self when she’s with him? Will falling into an experimentalist’s orbit finally tempt her to put her most guarded theories on love into practice?I bet you that this book will be that the girl finds out how soft and sweet he is under that scary persona and he'll only be nice to herEven the covers look the sameI rest my casethank you for coming to my TED talkp.s i will still be reading this because well women in stem what am i to do? already not enough around so despite my hypothesis (get ittt) i will still be reading and lets hope that I am dead wrong.........................this looks like every other Ali Hazelwood book ESPECIALLY THE LOVE HYPOTHESIS IT LOOKS THE EXACT SAMEBut at least he doesn’t have black hair right? Let’s take what we can get…………………AliPlease don’t become a one hit wonder. Do something different.Love Zoe",4
1154,"Love, Theoretically","The queen of STEM romance, the creator of the quirkiest, nerdiest, most entertaining, likable, and huggable characters is back! And she's returned with my all-time favorite trope: enemies to lovers!I can honestly say this is my favorite book of hers because it's funnier, sexier, and quirkier! Did I mention that Jack Smith is the best book boyfriend she's ever created? That sulking, intense, intelligent man knows how to make a girl happy! He's passionate, but he perfectly controls himself to put Elsie's needs first. He's caring, patient, and gentle. I loved him!Let me introduce you to dear Elsie, who deserves ten thousand hugs. She has a Ph.D. in theoretical physics. When she couldn't get an academic position, she resorted to fake-dating to pay off her student loans. Even though she still lives in a crappy apartment with her bestie Cece, she remains hopeful that she'll find a better position in the near future. She still manages to keep her head above water as an adjunct professor, teaching five different classes, grading labs, and reading her students' very sincere emails (those emails made my week! I laughed too hard!). Meanwhile, her mother forces her to become a negotiator to solve her big brothers' extra immature problems they've gotten themselves into!Elsie's weakness is that she doesn't know the meaning of ""no""! She can never say the word! She molds herself into a different character for each person in her life, putting their needs first. That's why she never thinks about what she really wants from the universe!Then, her path crosses with her nemesis. She finds out that Jack Smith, the brooding but charismatic brother of her best fake-dating customer Greg, is the same person who wrote an article that ruined her mentor's career! Unfortunately, he's also the man who's in charge of the physics department at MIT and one of the decision-makers who will decide if she's the right candidate for her dream job. Jack supports another candidate for the job and is shocked to find out that Elsie is not the librarian girlfriend of her brother, as he was led to believe. As an experimental theorist, he has every intention of rejecting to work with a theorist!Elsie has no intention of giving up her dream job without a fight. She's determined to fight against the man who gets under her skin. Yes, she finds him very attractive. Yes, she wants to rip his clothes off and kiss him senseless, then punch him in the face. But she can restrain her feelings to be professional, right? Oh, you already know the answer!Overall, Elsie and Jack were dynamite! I loved their dialogues, hilarious banters, and blazing chemistry! This is my favorite work of the author! I wish I could give it more than five stars!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter",5
1155,"Love, Theoretically","""You could be my entire world. If you let me.""""I think I will.""So conflicted thoughts.. It's not a bad rating, I did enjoy it but there were things which could have been better.✔️ Enemies to lovers✔️ STEM romance✔️ She is dating his brother (in a way)✔️ Witty banter✔️ Slow burn✔️ Twilight references (lots of them)✔️ Adam and Olive cameoFirstly, let me start by saying this one wasso much better than Love on the Brain.I hated that one so much.*sigh*Or maybe it's the fact that it's been long since I read The Love Hypothesis that this was enjoyable. Although,there are few similarities to TLH but it's not overbearing.Like Adam and Olive, and unlike Bee and Levi Elsie and Jack are unique and true to themselves. But if you are looking for them to recreate the same magic as in TLH, you will be disappointed. Cause the two here, are quite forgettable and bland.Elsie,is not a bad FMC, she is quite relatable in some places and such a pushover in others that it gets a bit frustrating. However she stays true to her personality- being a people pleaser. I did like how she was able to be her true self around Jack.Jackis not like Adam and that's simply put. Don't get me wrong, he is nice, kind and respectful but he is also boring. I like that he's paying attention to details, calling Elsie out on her bs, and always so open to her but there's no firepower in him. He's just there.""I have these elaborate daydreams that Im feeding you a five course meal I hunted, field dressed and prepare all by myself.""Coming to theromance,it was okay-ish. I enjoyed some of their moments together. I LOVED the Twilight references. I enjoyed the first half when Jack was trying to figure Elsie out, especially when she was involved with Greg. But the two had very little heat. It was not angsty.The slow burn was too slow. The spice was not spice, it was just salt and pepper.The fact that the two kept talking and talking and talking and talking and talking while trying to figure out where to put his fingers and dick in..it was too late. Look, I appreciate he wants to be sure she wants it but how many times does she have to repeat herself 😭😭 Also the fact she kept pushing him for sex after knowing how clear he made it that he wants things slow- 🚩🚩 In my opinion,I would prefer that Ali Hazelwood writes a clean romance rather than whatever tf she thinks is smut.I really loved the Adam and Olive cameo, even for a short while they radiated power, chemistry and all things good. Theendingwas okay. Doesn't really end big.Overall,an enjoyable read but quite forgettable.I actually forgot the FMCs name the moment I closed the book so 🤷‍♀️ Am just glad it was better than Love on the Brain.~•~•~Lets goooooPls don't disappoint~•~•~Love the cover but I swear if this is the Love Hypothesis 3.0 I'm gonna lose it. I need Ali Hazelwood to prove to me (and the rest of the world) that she's not a one hit wonder 👀",3
1156,"Love, Theoretically","if you've ever wanted to read a sciencey, quirky romance filled with tumblr-esque pop culture references and toddler-age memes about a huge, serious, no-nonsensedickwadman who manages to have gleaming abs and marvel-esque biceps despite being a nerd who ostensibly lives inside of a laboratory, lifting nothing heavier than chalk and bunsen burners, as he meets a goofy not-like-other-girls Woman In Stem whose various traumas and backstories and mildly inconvenient past relationships mean she'ssearching for a daddy to daughter her uplooking for love in all the wrong places, i.e., not looking at all because she doesn't need a man, only science, bad internal dialogue, and her own personality (read: allotted ration of problematic personal relationships, adorkable food obsessions, and single nerdy non-academic interest), plus a sex scene or two that will include at least one turn of phrase cursed to sear into your retinas for the rest of time...you should read this book.and every other ali hazelwood book.because they're all the same.that's the review.bottom line: i have to stop reading these.---------------------tbr reviewsigh.yeah okay i'll read it",1

1158,"Love, Theoretically","I just want to know why Ali Hazelwood is obsessed with the idea that being a woman in STEM is the most miserable possible experience. I'm not saying that there's not misogyny in STEM and/or academia, but I also think that it's incredibly unhelpful to repeatedly say that if you're a woman in STEM that you're going to be undermined, manipulated, gaslit, miserable, and broke until a 6'4"" man with a giant dick comes and saves you",1

1161,"Love, Theoretically","I love Ali Hazelwood, but this one stretched my incredulity to the limit. No one can possibly be this much of a doormat, can they?Elsie is slaving away as an adjunct professor teaching too many classes to make ends meet. She supplements her meager earnings by being a fake girlfriend, putting her people-pleasing tendencies to good use. When a chance at her dream job arises, the only thing standing in her way is Jack, the annoying older brother of someone she's fake-dating, who also happens to be on her interview committee. But do they really hate each other or is it more like they secretly have the hots for each other? Ha!I really enjoyed the first half of this story. It starts strong with all of the hallmarks I love from Ali Hazelwood—snark, banter, science, smart female in STEM, and puns. I was breezing through it, smiling and chuckling to myself on pretty much every sentence. No one does funny situations and dialogues quite like Hazelwood, and she had me in stitches.I'll grant you that the premise is a bit out there. What are the odds that the guy Elsie is hating/lusting after, is also the brother of a guy she's fake-dating, while also being the only person who almost beat her at Go, while also being the guy who irreparably damaged her field of study back in the day, while also being the head of the physics department at MIT where she is interviewing? I'll tell you what, it's 100% according to this book.But as the story went on, Elsie started to annoy me. First, she refuses to believe that Jack is attracted to her even though he tells her so on multiple occasions. At one point, she even interprets him saying ""Can I take you out?"" as he wants to murder her mob-style. Like what?Elsie also takes people-pleasing to heretofore-unseen heights. She lies to her roommate about pretty much every preference she has. She runs interference for her brothers at her mom's behest even though she doesn't want to. And she must get her mentor's approval before accepting a job offer that would give her several times her current salary and health insurance. Have mercy! My eyeballs were bruised from all the rolling.It's no secret that I prefer my female characters to be strong and smart, ready to kick ass and save the world. Elsie is strong in her work, but the opposite in every other way. And slowly, over many demure ""You can't possibly like me,"" it started to grate on my nerves. Not even Hazelwood's many comedic reliefs can save it from such never-ending waffling and meekness.This may just have been a case where I wasn't a good fit for the book. Without being able to connect with Elsie, I never really invested in the story. Not to mention I couldn't feel any chemistry between Jack and Elsie, and it all made for a rather lackluster read by the end.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Love HypothesisLove on the BrainThe STEMinist NovellasUnder One RoofStuck with You~~~~~~~~~~~~This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

Better than theLove Hypothesis(4-stars) andLove on the Brain(3-stars)! Honestly, my favorite contemporary romance of the year! 🤩Ali Hazelwood is the QUEEN OF STEM ROMANCE!Seriously, I could give two flying f*cks about STEM, yet somehow Ali is able to center an entire story around it while making it interesting and explaining it in a way that allows me to understand. But what always stands out is the way Ali portrays the struggles women in STEM have to go through. From blatant sexism to sexual harassment to manipulation, the challenges are appalling and endless. I specifically liked how she dives into the 'type' of acceptable women in STEM:""The you people want is sharp, impeccable, perfect enough to justify your intrusion in a field that for centuries has been 'rightfully' male. But not too perfect, because apparently only 'stone-cold bitches' are like that, and they do not make for congenial, affable colleagues.""For fuck's sake, that's insane, but the absolute truth. It's infuriating to see the amount of pandering women in STEM have to do to the men in their field so that they are accepted. Once again, thank you, Ali Hazelwood, for bringing awareness to such an important topic.I really connected to Elsie on a personal level.Elsie has been a people pleaser her entire life, to the point that she masquerades many different faces around different people in order to fit their expectations or make them love and accept her. This begs the question of who is the real Elsie Hannaway? Unfortunately, Elsie doesn't really know since she's been living her life for others and ignores what she truly wants and needs. I know some people might think that the extent to which she people pleases is dramatic, but I can with 100% certainty say, I've been her. Yes, I've put on facades to make people feel more at ease. I've lied about my likes and interests to fit in with people. I've tampered down my own personality so people will find me more acceptable. I've done things I didn't want to do because it's what was expected of me. And this didn't just happen with strangers. It also happened around friends and family. And let me tell you, it was exhausting and terrifying not being able to just be who you are - living in constant fear that someone will dislike you or find you weird or think you're beneath them. Luckily, I went to therapy and have worked on breaking out of the people-pleasing cycle. And I'm so glad Elsie also starts therapy at the end. I really think Ali Hazelwood did a fantastic job portraying what it's like being a people-pleaser and how much it can emotionally and psychologically impact you.The friendship between Cece and Elsie was everything.I really adore Cece's humor and how incredibly loyal, supportive, and loving she is to Elise. And even after finding out Elsie hasn't been completely open and honest with her, Cece's first instinct is to say,""I will love you forever.""My heart nearly burst wide open because that is true love.Jack. The love of my life. One of my favorite MMC of all time!Where do I even begin with this man? He's perceptive, confident, honest, charming, thoughtful, intelligent, kind, handsome, sexy, and pretty much the most perfect man to ever be written! I love him (in case you can't tell lol). Not only does he fall first, but he is a huge freaking simp for Elsie and just wants to take care of her. Seriously, this guy is a dream. 😍 But what I love even more is that Jack is a supportive KING! Jack encourages Elsie to just be herself, and while she struggles to learn exactly whose that is, he is there with constant love and support, and lets her discover these things in her own time.The romance is perfection!We start with so much tension, misconceptions, and hate (on Elsie's side), and then it explodes into this profoundly wonderful and deeply emotional love. There's so much chemistry, respect, love, and care between these two that it makes my heart soar.The spice was a RIDE!Our girl Elsie has never really enjoyed sex or felt much sexual attraction towards anyone . . . before Jack. And while Elsie wants to just jump his bones, Jack takes his time and focuses first and foremost on her pleasure and her pleasure alone, all so she can discover what she likes. And DAMN it is HOT. 🥵 This is the spiciest Ali Hazelwood book yet, and I ATE THAT SHIT UP!""I think I want to do this every day,"" he responds, kissing my pussy like he would my mouth. ""Every day for the rest of my life.""I also love that Jack sets some boundaries sexually because he wants to make sure this is truly something Elsie wants, and not just something she thinks she has to do for him to like her (which we learn is something she did with a previous partner).Overall, Love, Theoretically is a witty, charming, and sexy story with lots of depth that will make you laugh and tug at your heart.Ali Hazelwood's writing is a dream, the pacing is fantastic, and the characters are so amazing that you can't help but fall in love with them. I could go on and on about all the things I love about this book, but this would turn into a full-blown essay, so I'll stop here. But the bottom line is this is one of the best contemporary romance books I've ever read. I 100% recommend reading it and hope you love it as much as I do!Thank you to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group for providing an eARC in exchange for an honest review!

1165,"Love, Theoretically","5 Bright Twilight Loving Stars!!!""You could be my entire world. If you let me""Yep, that's right. AND, I am just going to say it..... this book is BETTER than The Love Hypothesis, I said what I said.Elsie is an adjunct professor struggling to make ends meet financially while also not doing the work that she really feels passionate about when the opportunity of a lifetime, to teach/research at MIT, presents itself. She just has to nail her interview and all her dreams will come true. But there is just one problem. Jack Smith. Her professional nemesis, a man that she hates like it's her religion, and is also one of the deciding votes on whether or not she gets the job. Oh, and he also is the brother of the man she is fake dating. Whoops.Aahh! I LOVED this book so much. I am as shocked as anyone, bc its easily my favorite contemporary romance of the year so far. I was really weary going in bc of so many mixed reviews, but honestly this book just resonated with me. The romance is fantastic, I am a sucker for academic rivals and this one is done PERFECTLY! The tension is soooo good! It was objectively hilarious, the banter was top tier, the cast of supporting characters were absolutely delightful from her quirky best friend Cece to the puny professor Volkov and Jacks sweet brother and taciturn grandmother, they all served to move the story in someway and were fun and interesting. AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE ADAM AND OLIVE CAMEO?!!!! 😍😍 SO CUTE!!!!! Also, this is her best writing by far, the pacing is perfect, the story flows, it was funny and smart and well developed from start to finish.Elsie-I really, really love Elsie and I know that at times she isn't exactly easy to love bc she masks so much but I really appreciated her struggles with her identity. She has formed this survival instinct born from childhood emotional neglect and then later just being a woman trying to get by in a field that is largely a boys club and she loses herself and ultimately this pseudo persona overwhelms her whole life . I really liked seeing a woman become self aware and take steps to change that and that it was hard and not immediate. So often I see people say, well she should know better or she is too smart to be so oblivious, and sometimes that's true. But sometimes it's not, and there is a process of change that has to happen and those paths are never neat or pretty and I really appreciated that progression in her character arc. And also, a high IQ doesn't always equal a high EQ, being smart doesn't exempt you from having deep emotional issues and doesn't make you any less smart, it just makes you human.Jack-Ahh this man is so whipped for Elsie and I LOVED it! And can we just talk about how good dirty he is?! I already have a thing for the surly Professor type and this is another one that goes on the roster of top hot teachers bc damn! The fireworks and the chemistry between Jack and Elsie were AMAZING! I ate it up and also I thought the sex scenes were super hot and I also appreciated that they were realistic. I kind of liked that they were trial and error bc not everyone is some sexpert like you read in so many novels. But besides that, I love how he respects Elsie and her talent. He is attentive to everything about her and sees the real her and forces her to be herself and drop the pretense but he does it in a way that is so non judgmental and supportive of what Elsie wants for herself and not everyone else including him. I love that he isn't perfect either and also struggling with his own issues.Random things I loved-CeCe, Elsie's best friend is so funny and weird and she made me laugh the entire book.-George was so sweet!-The grandmother, you gotta love an old lady that gives zero fucks and tells it like it is.-The Twilight references 🤌-The Hoth reference!!-Olive and Adam 😭😭",5
1166,"Love, Theoretically","HEAVEN FOR NERDS, that's what this book is (I'm nerds)OVERALL THOUGHTS: This book was just WHAT I needed, WHEN I needed it! I've only read The Love Hypothesis by this author before and it was highly enjoyable (I rated it 4 stars). BUT THIS ONE WAS AMAZING. To be honest, this is not my original opinion, but I've seen people say this is Hazelwood's best work so far. I'm not exactly qualified to speak on this, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I LOVED THIS BOOK. Yes the romance was very typically Ali Hazelwood, highly unrealistic and bubbly, but you simply cannot hate it. However, there were certain parts of this story that really sticked out to me and for that reason I'll list them here:1. THE PLOT - I would suggest going into this book without reading the blurb. I haven't read it before reading the actual book and that's why this was like an Easter egg to me. Important plot points were revealed early in the book, BUT THOSE REVELATION SCENES were so good, my Kindle flew across the room. This is another Ali Hazelwood ""Women in STEM find unrealistically good gigantic men"" novel and that's all you need to know. And yeah, they're physicists in this one!2. THEORISTS VS EXPERIMENTALISTS - Listen, I don't care for physics, I had an A back in high school but I always hated the subject (sorry not sorry). Which means, theories and experiments on crystals, research papers on quantum mechanics and what not don't mean much to me, but in this little novel (not really little, this was THICK) YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE HOW MUCH BANTER WE GOT from their scientific disagreements. Sign me up, nerds are hot! But also like, we didn't get TMI on those topics, so I didn't feel suffocated.3. THE JOKES - This book had me LAUGHING on so many occasions. And I'm not big on laughing while reading, especially LAUGHING OUT LOUD! But hey, I was gasping at some of these. And unfortunately, most of those dad jokes that one professor (can't be bothered to check his name again) threw around had me hollering. ALSO, student mail that Elsie received was peak humour.4. POP CULTURE REFERENCES - As much as I can remember, Ali Hazelwood is big on these. Here, it was like every other sentence. But my silly little gemini brain feeds off of them! Barbie was mentioned, Chris Nolan (TWICE), A PERFECT CURE FOR MY POST-BARBENHEIMER DEPRESSION (I don't know if that's a thing, pls tell me is anyone has it). Like I said, I got this book WHEN I needed it and it was WHAT I needed.5. ACADEMIA REALNESS - this aspect is something I admire Ali Hazelwood for. And said aspect was more prominent in this book than in The Love Hypothesis. Even though these books are unrealistic (I'm tired of myself saying that), they still deliver some very real situations that happen in STEM surroundings almost every day. I'm a med student myself and I've spent 4 years already in this atmosphere, so certain struggles (money, women in science, stealing work, struggling to achieve your goals, abandoning your interests for your scientific dream) Elsie has (had) I really can identify with. Hazelwood gives you this very cruel manly toxic world and offers you a perfect fairytale escape, MOTHER ENERGY!🧎🏼‍♀️6. MEDICAL CONDITION REP - Our female protagonist in this novel has diabetes type 1, while she doesn't have health insurance and has to finance each and every insulin bolus herself. I'm not making it to be this big Nobel-prize-for-peace thing, but it was nice to see this very common but life-threatening condition represented in popular fiction!CHARACTERS I usually describe main characters separately but I won't be doing that here. I loved Elsie and Jack equally. Their chemistry was really well-written. Many aspects of their personalities are sort of spoilers so I also won't be sharing those. Other aspects were written above. One thing tho, Jack's physical description reminds me of Dominic Sherwood (used to act in the terrible Shadowhunters show). Did anyone else get that reference (was he by any chance based on Dom or am I making that up)? Pls tell me in the comments. 🧐NOTE: This book was much spicier that The Love Hypothesis so do with that info what you want! 🤭I CAN'T WAIT TO READ MORE ALI HAZELWOOD!💕💕",5

1168,"Love, Theoretically","I hate to say it but I didn’t love this book…It’s not that I hated it, but maybe even I got tired of the repetitiveness. I mean to be fair I did expect a big guy to fall (first) for a small girl and fuck her without a condom. It’s just that unfortunately this time the big guy was a little bland and I didn’t fall for him and the small girl was dumb af, especially for a brilliant scientist.Maybe Twilight fans will appreciate the Twilight references and the fact that Elsie reads people (almost like Edward) but Jack is the only person she can’t read (almost like Bella), but I’m not a Twilight fan.On top of that Elsie’s entire career can be a trigger and don’t even get me started on Jack’s childhood. However that’s probably a me problem.I didn’t even like the spice 🫣 she tried to kiss him and his reaction was the weirdest thing ever 😳However I have to admit it was low on miscommunication compared to the previous books so there’s progress!My favorite part was meeting Adam and Olive 🥹——-Okay, I didn’t get the arc, so you have to clean up the shit yourself, girl. I’m still reading the book though!——Dearest Ali,If I get this arc I will clean your cat’s litter box for a week. For a year.Sincerely,Dab",3
1169,"Love, Theoretically","Oh my GOD this book. Where do I even start? First of all, 5 stars. Easy. EASY 5 stars. There’s just something about the stories Ali Hazelwood crafts and the personalities she writes that hit with me. I loved The Love Hypothesis beyond words and was a bit iffy on Love on the Brain, so I wasn’t quite sure how this one was going to go, but oh my god she delivered again.@baskinsuns on tiktok has a really great video on this topic, but the way that Ali Hazelwood writes these male love interests who have such a deep and gentlelikeof the heroine is so…ooh she’s ruining my life. Yes it’s a romance novel so obviously they fall in love, but Jack Smith genuinely likes and enjoys Elsie as a person outside of his romantic love for her. He respects her, he admires her, he wants to hear her talk about the things she enjoys and he wants to experience them with her simply because it makes her happy. There’s a softness to the way Ali Hazelwood’s men care for their partners that just hits different.And the academic rivals in this book? Top fucking tier. From the very get go. It’s delicious. Delectable. I’m eating it up on every goddamn page. The dynamic it engenders between Elsie - the consummate People Pleaser - and the love interest being the one person she doesn’t care about pleasing is amazing.The story is beyond engaging, it went in some directions I didn’t expect it to go, it had me rooting for physics debates, and I could have read another hundred pages of these two.And you know what really REALLY shows how much I love this book? If you’ve been here for a little while you probably know I hate pop culture references in books. Viscerally. This book is at minimum 8% TWILIGHT references, and it was still an easy 5 stars. No question about it.I loved our main couple, I loved the side characters (I would read an entire novella about visits with Millicent), I was super invested in the plot, and the third act and finale is just…everything is so good.",5

1172,"Love, Theoretically","I think that ending the acknowledgements section of this book with the sentence ""Time is a finite and precious resource, and I'm constantly overcome with emotion that people choose to spend it on my words"" was not particularly nice of the author to do. But the time isn't coming back, and if there's one thing I intend to do tonight, it's succumb to the sunk cost fallacy. On with the review.I tend to leave Ali Hazelwood alone because I'm not in her intended demographic (read: person who can see one character responding to another character's ignorance about clothes with ""Wow. Men."" without wanting to die), but I picked this up because I saw that the protagonist works as a hired girlfriend, and I wanted to know whether it was going to be offensive or not. It is, which is sad, because the author has clearly worked very hard to make it less so; there's a point early when she specifies that the work she doescertainlydoesn't include sex, and then reassures us that she does believe sex work is real work, ""and people who engage in it are just as deserving of respect as ballerinas, or firefighters, or hedge fund managers."" Sure! Great! Hedge fund managing is not real work, but I get where you're coming from!It's just that this comes in the same book as the character referring to cracking a bad pun in order to increase her chances of getting a job as ""this prostitution of my sense of humor"", and the whole premise is that the love interest is the person she can ""be her real self around"", unlike her clients, even though he is 1) on her hiring committee and 2) immediately after he leaves her hiring committee, offers her a job. Also, the heroine's roommate, who also works as a hired girlfriend, is ""way too beautiful"" to be good at it without problems. I mean, okay.Honestly, the author just doesn't seem particularly interested in the whole premise, except as a way to emphasize that the heroine's people-pleasing problems arereallybad—I mean, they're so bad that she even... lets herself be PAID to pretend to DATE. The whole line between ""faking being a girlfriend"" and ""working as a girlfriend"" seems pretty unclear to Hazelwood—some of the work entails making up stories to her clients' family and friends about how the two of them met and whether she's being paid, which is obviously faking something, but she also specifies that other gigs just entail ""going places as arm candy"" without talking. I bring this up because I do kind of feel that the author believes (or is working on believing) that sex-adjacent work isn't inherently shameful, but she does think on some level itisinherently dishonest. Which: mm.Mainly the reason I feel this way is because the whole arc of the novel is our heroine getting over her people-pleasing tendencies. At this point I need to be clear that this is just not a very well-written character trait. She refers, constantly, to having a different version of herself for every social situation, but what we actually see her do is ""say something nice to a girl who's about to cry"", ""crack jokes to someone who enjoys jokes"", ""pretend to like movies she doesn't like"", and ""help sort out family problems when her mom asks her to."" At one point she says she's about to tell us her tried-and-true procedure for Becoming A Different Person, and it is, in full: 1) Figure out what the other person needs. 2) Plan to do it. 3) Do it. Like—can we get something about, I don't know, observing body language? Altering tone? The protagonist references ""code-switching"" by name, but she never seems to use different registers for different situations? Plato identified four types of flattery off the top of his head and he didn't even have Google, man, is this really the best we can do? Anyway. You can see how this person would get pushed around a lot, sure (a female romance protagonist? with no backbone? Groundbreaking.), but the shapeshifting social chameleon that we're told about just never really appears.What does appear is someone who's considerate of others, but absolutely miserable about that, and only feels like her ""real self"" when she's yelling at the love interest. From the bottom of my heart: 'kay. How Ithinkthe author intended these scenes to come across, though, is less that the heroine is constantly shapeshifting into new people and more that she is someone constantly in what we might call ""customer service mode"".I feel, generally, weird about the idea that someone who can't switch out of customer service mode makes a particularly good escort, and it would remain a kind of weird itch in the back of my brain, but that line about ""prostitution of my sense of humor"" pushes it over the line for me a little. It's hard to shake the feeling that Hazelwood has articulated to herself that Elsie is ""prostituting her personality out to everyone she meets"", or something of that nature. (Not sexually, of course! She'll describe the sex with her ex that she didn't enjoy at all and only had to please him, but she wasn't beingpaidfor it!) I feel weird when the heroine reassures the hero that her last client (his brother) is so nice that she ""would have [worked as his girlfriend] for free"". And I feel weirder when the heroine and the hero's whole relationship seems to consist of him going ""What do you wanna do?"", her saying, ""What doyouwanna do?"", and him going sternly, ""No... what doyouwanna do?"" until she gets wildly turned on.Like—again, this man is on her hiring committee. I don't really buy that she simply can't turn on customer-service mode with him just because she can't read his face. (In a book where the heroine's number one thing is Loving The Twilight Saga, I will admit that ""he's the only person whose mind she can't read!!!"" as a plot point is absolutely hilarious.) When inauthenticity is so explicitly tied to her escort work, and she falls for him because he aggressively refuses to let her be ""inauthentic"", it feels... kind of like she's a ~fallen woman who he's saving~, if you see what I mean.Anyway, I should note that she has Type 1 diabetes and, due to sudden and plot-convenient miscalculations of her blood sugar, twice faints dramatically in his arms. It's so hard to get a proper case of consumption these days.There are at least three plot-relevant issues of miscommunication that happen because, just as someone is about to say something important, something loud or disgusting happens in the background. Also, the protagonist once describes ""fantasies of filling [the hero] with candy and taking a bat to him"". Time is a finite and precious resource, and it becomes increasingly evident that the Fates have not marked me to spend it on shit that is good. At this point I will accept ""wild"", I guess.",1
1173,"Love, Theoretically","No yall have no idea how obsessed I am with Ali Hazelwood. I want her to write my Eulogy.Edit: Good lord, few more hours. I simply cannot wait.Review:This book was a miss for me. The characters were unremarkable and forgettable. It's sad. It just lacked the magic TLH and LOTB had. Jack was bland and there was nothing particularly interesting about him. I never quite warmed upto him and I didn't quite buy their romance. Their chemistry was lack luster and nothing special. Elsie was a bit better. She was relatable. But I didn't love her like I loved Olive and Bea.This was sadly disappointing and it just lacked the Ali Hazelwood magic.",3
1174,"Love, Theoretically","This is Ali Hazelwood’s best workhelloooo jack and elsie are my new favorite couple idkI adored this! Funny, heartfelt and thoughtful in ways I wasn’t sure Ali Hazelwood was capable of. It has her signature cheesy humor, big man x small woman trope and the silly oblivious girl x obsessed boy trope, and yet I think this time she perfected the formula. I adored Elsie just as much as Jack did, I admired her, I worried for her, and I was so heavily invested in her career and her happiness that it surprised me. Jack was fun, supportive, and he brought a great balance to the story with his clear communication and emotional openness.

1175,"Love, Theoretically","3.5 starsThis book was a mixed bag for me.Imagine my surprise when half way through the book, the result of who got the ""dream job"" at MIT that is mentioned in the blurb is revealed. Now, this was a very emotional scene and really well done I have to say. I was absolutely loving this book up to this point!But then right after that it started to go downhill for me and I started to get a little annoyed with it. I mean, if someone you are attracted to, who also has indicated they find you attractive, says to you the phrase ""I want to take you out"" would you interpret this to mean they are stating they want to kill you? That scene alone almost sent me over the edge. Like, be for real, that is patently stupid.Speaking of stupid, if you are a grown adult who has several jobs, that were not what you wanted to do, paid shit, and didn't include medical insurance which you desperately need for your expensive medical condition and suddenly you were offered a fantastic job that paid more than all your bad jobs combined, is what you want to do, and includes medical insurance - would you wait weeks to accept that job because you needed to talk to your advisor first? NO ONE IS THAT MUCH OF A DOORMAT. NO. ONE.Ok this review sounds really really negative, but honestly I did enjoy the first half of this book. Like really, really enjoyed it. But that second half? Man, that was rough. Though I will say the apology/grovel at the end was great.First half of the book was like 4.5 stars, second half was like 2.5 stars, so 3.5 stars overall rating was where I landed at.",3

Yeh. All of them. I've read 6 of her books and yeah. They are all the same story. The only difference is the names of the characters and the science field they work (and rival) in. This book is the worst. The female MC is the dumbest character I've ever read. Seriously. If you want an example, here it is. She wakes up next to him after just sleeping. She feels his big, huge, enormous... You know. And she thinks he has to PEE. To pee. I shit you not. A phd physicist thinks men have er3cti0n when they have to pee.Example no2.

Yes, honey, after having you alone in his home for the whole night, he is going to take you to a public restaurant to kill you.There are more of these dumb scenes, but I don't want to waste any more time on this book.

What I can say with full and total confidence is that Jack Smith is the absolute best character she's ever written. Sigh.Elsie Hannaway is a theoretical physicist who is barely making ends meet by being an adjunct professor so she has a little side hustle if you will. That is how she meets Jack Smith. The first time. When she is interviewing for her dream job at MIT she meets him again.This is what I like to call a one sided enemies to lovers. Because lets be honest. This amazing hero is completely gone for the heroine from the start. Whether he wants to be or not. Seriously, I just adored Jack. He was the best. I love how much he cared about Elsie and she became a better version of herself just by being with him.This book had a lot of science. Ali Hazelwood is so much smarter than I am, and I'm not going to lie, some of the physics stuff went right over my head, but that's okay. I love reading books about smart women. I imagine it can be so challenging being a female in this field and I love that Ali gives a voice to that.Love, Theoreticallyis a book I didn't want to put down.

1179,"Love, Theoretically","“You are the most magnificent thing that ever happened to me.”This book was so good! This was such a fun and heartwarming rom-com about love, discovering who you are and following your dreams. Love, Theoretically follows Elsie Hannaway, a theoretical physicist who works as an adjunct professor during the day and a fake-girlfriend at night. When a research position opens up at MIT Elsie jumps at the opportunity, but she discovers that she would be working with Jack Smith, the older brother of one of her fake-dating clients and an experimental physicist. Will Elsie be able to put their differences aside and open up her heart to Jack?""I want you, Elsie. All of the time. I think of you. All. The. Fucking. Time.""I became immersed in this rom-com from the very first page. The plot was interesting and the pacing was perfect. This book had some of my favorite tropes including academic rivals-to-lovers, fake-dating and found family. I really liked the writing style, it's witty, relatable and descriptive. The characters were relatable and interesting. I really liked Elsie, she is kind, friendly, strong, hardworking, smart, fun, and amiable, although she was naive at times. Elsie is a relatable character, she makes mistakes, but she owns up to them and she does her best to please people. Elise's character development was excellent, I enjoyed watching her discover who she is and what she wants in life. I loved Jack, he is smart, sweet, charming, respectful, hardworking, and very handsome. I really liked the side characters, especially George, Cece, and Greg. The side characters each had their own personalities and are very kind and supportive people. I loved the Olive and Adam cameo! I was so happy to see them, it made me smile so much. I loved the banter between Jack and Elsie, it made me laugh and smile so many times. The chemistry between the main characters was off the charts. I really liked Jack and Elsie's romance, they respected each other and were honest when they made a mistake. The spice was so good, although it was a bit awkward at times. There were several cute scenes that made swoon and blush. The ending was so good, I'm so happy it ended on a happy note.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies, academic rivals-to-lovers romance, fake-dating, and great characters.",4
1180,Reminders of Him,"buddy read with""who is Scotty?""and""why does she judge him for buying one plate?""i hope those two have fun but i'm outta here.dnf 50% in. thank you for everyone who encouraged me to do this: i love you. everyone who wanted me to finish: i have nothing to say to you.this will be the last Colleen Hoover book i'll ever read (and i already didn't even want to read this one, i was asked to)if someone points a gun at me and says ""i won't kill you if you read a Colleen Hoover book"", i'll be like ""well, guess today's the day i die then""Colleen and me don't vibe, never have, never will, and i honestly don't understand what y'all see in her books but who am i to judge your reading tastes - hope you're all having fun and enjoying life.i was told to see the bright side in things, so, on the bright side: i now know what book to add to my worst reads of the year in december, so look forward to that.yes, me dnf'ing it 50% in will not stop me from putting it into that ranking, leave me alone.why am i dnf'ing? listen, i had to like physically hype myself up to read every single sentence:""Let's go Jonathan!!! You can do this!!!! You only have 99% left!!!! It's notthatbad!!""i was about to do some jumping jacks to get the adrenaline going.i was this close to tears several times - and not because Colleen's writing is in any way shape or form moving to me - it's because i don't even want tolookat this, let alonereadit.here's what i liked:this scene -""Does Cupcake girl have a name?"" ""Everyone has a name.""it has absolutely zero relevance to the plot. it's barely a scene, but people say to start criticism with something positive, so here you go.the list y'all actually want - there will obviously beSPOILERS:🕴️the emoji has no significance, i just thought it's funny🕴️ i have never liked CoHo's writing. idk, it's just trying too hard to be poetic and deep without having this nice and flowy feel to it that actual good poetic prose has🕴️this one is especially fake deep because there is like nothing that deep going on with the plot🕴️it was mostly just boring🕴️CoHo always tries to tackle those heavy themes and i have yet to see her manage that in a good way. this time it's driving under the influence of alcohol. Kenna drives drunk and kills her boyfriend and then instead of calling for help, she leaves because she thinks he is dead and she is afraid of the consequences. It turns out that Scotty wasn't actually dead and lived for another six hours just lying there somewhere on the side of the road, left alone to die.Kenna could (should) have called the ambulance, even if she thought he was already dead. She didn't. She served 5 years for this in prison. CoHo wants you to feel sorry for her (""But it's five years."" ""It was one mistake."").No. She KNEW she was drunk. She STILL drove, DESPITE being drunk. She got into an ACCIDENT BECAUSE SHE WAS DRUNK. She DIDN'T call an ambulance because she thought Scotty was already dead, which is NOT a good excuse to not call an ambulance. She just LEFT. That man SUFFERED for SIX more hours before he DIED. And you want me to feel sorry for her? No.🕴️Kenna has a child in prison, that gets taken away by Scotty's parents who are very adamant about her never seeing her again. Now i know nothing about child protection laws and whatever and i don't know whether Kenna should have been given the right of seeing her daughter again, let alone getting back the privilege of having some sort of custody but both Scotty's parents and Ledger treated her like a lunatic that would just kidnap the child and then get into another car drunk and killing her as well.Ledger went as far as accusing her of being ""selfish"" as if it wasn't apparently clear that she just wanted to see her child at least once. If she was indeed what Ledger pretended she was why go back at all? If she was as selfish and heartless and a stone cold killer as they all made her out to be she would have surely just stayed away, glad that she didn't have to be in the kid's life?Do biological parents deserve the right to be in their childrens' lives? Probably not, depending on the circumstances, but the way they treated her at points was just ridiculous.So was Kenna just trying to show up at their doorstep one day though. There are official channels to do it. I don't think the American system isthatbroken that a mother could not try to get her child back, even if she doesn't have any money.🕴️the romance in this was - as it always is in CoHo's books - way too insta lovey. Ledger had his wedding vows ready the time he first caught a glimpse of her. on page 10.i am just tired of this instant attraction bullshit. where's the build up? why would i want to read someone go ""She is all I can think about. Her face is like a painting. I want to give her all my attention"" ten pages in? i don't even know the characters yet and you expect me to root for them already? give me at least some build-up please. do y'all just go out and fall in love with people the second they walk in? i'm sorry but i just don't believe this🕴️shouldn't Ledger also hate her for killing his best friend? he gets over that pretty fast and actually betrays the trust of the child's guardians by showing Kenna pictures of her child, which was totally not his place to do. he's known those people for his entire life, he practically co-raises that kid but throws it all away for a woman he barely knows and who killed his best friend? make it make any kind of sense🕴️CoHo really saiddiversity✨ in this one and made sure to mention that Ledger hired black and hispanic people in his bar. it's truly a win against racism today🕴️ it's also a win for the LGBT community because CoHo made Kenna question her sexuality for an entire half sentence!!!🕴️ we love authors who give us representation 🤧🕴️ i can't say anything about the ending: i have read spoilers and it sounds bad and i know i haven't missed anything🕴️CoHo tries to make her readers emotional by giving her characters tragic backstories (why does someone always accidentally kill or injure someone in her books though) and then throwing them into the most convoluted circumstances. it's always so obvious and fake deep and the deep conversations she's trying to have aren't even done right and she somehow always manages to romanticize or excuse fucked up behaviour that should neither be romanticized nor excused.i'm done. y'all have fun though. 1 star.",1
1181,Reminders of Him,"WithReminders of Him, Colleen Hoover cements her status as queen of the emotional read.You'd think having read so many of Hoover's books, I would be better prepared. One, always have a box of tissues ready. Two, never read it in public. But I haven't learned my lesson. This time, I was in the doctor's office, sitting in the waiting room, when I got walloped with the feels. I tried to pass it off as allergies, but sobbing and allergies don't exactly look the same, you know?Kenna has just been released from prison, where she served her time for an accident that had forever altered the course of her life. She returns to the town where it all went wrong, in the hopes of being reunited with the daughter she's never known. But old grudges die hard, and the town isn't so ready to welcome her back. The only ally she may have is Ledger, owner of the local bar, who has his own ties to her past.This book sure packs a punch. I don't know if it's just where I am in my life currently, but reading about Kenna's separation from her daughter was particularly painful and heartbreaking. It was hard not to cry through most of it, if I'm being honest. The other thing that really struck a chord with me is Kenna's hope for a second chance after having done her time. It's still pretty rare for literature to include this important theme, and I'm always so heartened to see it.There are so many sides to this story, so many different ways of looking at it. There's no real right or wrong, just lots of gray in the middle. It wouldn't surprise me if a lot of readers felt strongly that Kenna's situation is too harsh or too lenient. And I certainly wouldn't be surprised if those two groups ended up overlapping, with the same readers feeling both. This is exactly the sort of story that balances on an edge, tugging your heartstrings one way, then another.If I had one quibble, it's that the pacing of the story felt a little bit off. The middle part dragged on for longer than necessary without much in the way of plot advances. Then when we get to the end, the resolution happens seemingly out of nowhere, without any of the anticipated pushbacks. After the odyssey that was the journey, the ending felt a bit abrupt to me.Still, Colleen Hoover is known for delivering eminently readable stories, and this is just as riveting as the rest. Though she puts so much emotional toil into them, they never make me want to turn away. I want to continue flipping the pages. I want to feel whatever emotional punishment she has in store for me. And that's what makes her stories so special.Just don't forget my two tips if you're going to read this. And maybe I'll even remember them myself one day.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:It Ends with Us/It Starts with UsVerityRegretting YouUgly LoveLayla~~~~~~~~~~~~",4
1182,Reminders of Him,"colleen hoover put her whole colussy into this one…and she delivers once again. this goes down as another colleen hoover book that i devoured and ate tf up!my favorite thing about these books are the writing and characters. without even really noticing it, i found myself relating to Kenna (mc) and the emotions she went through. her growth and self forgiveness was the best thing to read through out the novel. she proves people make bad decisions but that doesn’t mean they are bad people. she shows that in her selflessness and fight.Ledger was an interesting character to read about. at times i was so enthralled by him. he was introduced as the dude that owns a bar, former NFL player, drives a truck, and tattoos?!?! like what more could i want ?!! 😍 and then there were moments that i was so heated and angry that i wanted to punch sense into him. he was a hard character to grow on but at last he charmed me. seriously, i couldn’t decide if i wanted to back hand slap him or ride him. i chose the latter…hehehehehehdid i find myself crying uncontrollably? abso-fucking-lutely! it wouldn’t be a colleen hoover book if not tf? i made the mistake of bringing this book to work to read to make the time pass by. 2 hours into my shift i find myself crying, sobbing, and shaking uncontrollably. my co-workers notice and the first thing i say is “oh allergy season” and that’s a complete fucking lie because it’s fucking snowing outside but you can’t let the boss find out that you’ve been hiding in a corner reading an incredible book instead of doing the work you’re actually hired to do…warning: do not bring CoHo books to work! you are setting yourself up for disaster!but fortunately the crying wasn’t even entirely because of sad scenes or anything traumatic, it was the scenes towards the end that left the biggest smile on my face. things really came full circle.i usually skip over acknowledgements but i read this one and i encourage you to do the same. my favorite line even came from the acknowledgments not the story itself.now idk what to do with my life?!? guess i’ll drive into the sunset to fill this void this book left me with. (good void)",5
1183,Reminders of Him,"Fuck you, Colleen Hoover! You had no right to make me cry like this.The last 10% were just rude. When I tell you I was looking hideous whilst ugly crying..I was sobbing as if I was Kenna.I experienced ALL the feelings that came with this story but by the end I was left genuinely happy. Kenna DESERVED that ending.This story embodies pain. Something CoHo is known all too well for. She strikes the balance of stories that seem so far out there - out there to my own world view - with so much care and heart.I knew I would love it as soon as I read the synopsis, but I was not ready to be bombarded with these intense emotions. And it's interesting to see how these complicated feelings were expressed by all parties involved in this story. All were valid. And it makes you think what your own reaction would've been like.Ledger and Kenna were a lot more nicer than I could I ever be, because if it was me, I'd be fighting and knocking some sense into these old ass people. They were quite frankly asking for it. There were so many moments where the feelings they expressed just felt so disrespectful and were out of line.But it is easy for me to say the above because I had a clearer picture of what was happening and the characters necessarily didn't.All to say that the sentiment is true: hurt people hurt people.""You think you know how you’ll react in a terrifying situation, but that’s the thing. You can’t think in a terrifying situation.""I respect the hell out of Colleen Hoover.",5
1184,Reminders of Him,"well. once again, CoHo had me crying ugly tears at 2am because thats just the kind of author she is.i felt different reading this one. instead of the usual butterflies and heart flutters her books normally give me, this feels very raw and heavy. its definitely a life story more than it is a love story.i will say that although kennas determination to be a good mom to her daughter is worth reading about, ledger totally steals the show. he is put in an unfathomable position and i think CoHo has written his character very well.so even though this didnt make me feel as light-hearted as i usually do with her books, i did feel something. admiration. grief. hope. discouragement. anger. but also happiness. it ends on a good note. <3↠4.5 stars",5

1188,Reminders of Him,"3 stars 💫🚨 Spoiler Alert 🚨- ​(proceed with caution I spoil pretty much everything...)💙 The Plot 💙Kenna Rowan,a 26-year-old single mother has just been released from a 5-year prison sentence for the involuntary manslaughter of her boyfriendScotty Landry, during a car accident with Kenna in the driver's seat. After her release, with $2000 to her name, she moves back to the town where it all began hoping to reunite with her 4-year-old daughterDiem, who was taken from Kenna as soon as she gave birth in prison, as Scotty's parentsGrace & Patrickgained full custody.On her first day back in town, she meets an enigmatic bar ownerLedger Ward, who along with his floppy hair and tattoo's intrigues her for the first time since meeting Scotty. The two share an intense night, with an instant connection until Kenna realizes that Ledger is Scotty's best friend.💙 The Characters 💙Kenna- There's a thing between me and CoHo heroines where I don't particularly like them that much, I only feel for them through their situations rather than their personalities(except for miss verity, she is and will always be an icon, a legend, and the moment evil villain or not).But Kenna? Oh my god, my heart actually broke for her countless times, so much so I kept screaming in my head when will someone give this poor girl a break. From her neglectful childhood, an absentee dad to a mother whose narcissism and lack of parenting resulted in Kenna being put in foster care twice, and then later on not developing a safe relationship with her mother, Kenna hadn't been dealt a good hand in life. Until she met Scotty.""When women say they’ve been to prison, people think trash, whore, addict, thief. But when men say they’ve been to prison, people add badges of honor to the negative thoughts, like trash, but badass, addict, but tough, thief, but impressive.""I loved her strength, she had zero money to her name but she didn't care, all she wanted was to see her baby that was ripped away from her arms. She got a job working minimum wage as a grocery bagging assistant, she worked extra hours for Ledger at his bar as a dishwasher all so she could prove her worth to the Landry's and be able to see her daughter Diem. People judged her for what happened that night, but she was distressed to the point where it lead her into pleading guilty because she felt like she needed to be punished for that accident, when in fact the truth is both ScottyANDKenna were high/drunk and got in the car. Yes, one died, but both needed to be held just as accountable or just as innocent.When Kenna lost all hopes of ever having custody of her daughter she turns to her mother, who is so horrible I wanted to slap the bitch all the way to Australia. Her mother is so bitter and resentful that Kenna was ungrateful to her for saving her from foster care(and then still proceeding to emotionally abuse and neglect her daughter), she refuses to even apply for visitation rights or half custody of Diem so that Kenna would at least be able to see her daughter whilst in prison.What I will add further is- something that really annoyed/confused me was the events of the actual accident. It was said that Kenna left the scene of the accident because she was so in shock from believing that Scotty is dead she WALKS AND WALKS until she magically ends up in her apartment, and wakes up the next day to the police breaking down her door to arrest her?HUH??The logistics ain't logiSTICKING.I don't understand how someone who is in shock, covered and drenched in blood walks for MILES upon MILES, knows exactly where they have to walk to find their way back home after crashing in the middle of nowhere... it's so sus.Scotty- Scotty and Kenna's love was so pure, told through the hundreds of letters that Kenna had written to him whilst in prison. They met when Kenna was 20, working as a cashier and Scotty kept coming back to buy one plate every time just so he could see her.“I rang up the plate and said, “You know, you can buy more than one thing at a time.”“I know,” you said. “But I only need one plate.”“Then why is this the fourth one you’ve bought?”“Because I’m trying to work up the nerve to ask you out.”That same night they went on their first date, Scotty actually broke up with his girlfriend that same day just so he could take Kenna out 😂 and the next 6 months flew by as they fell head over heels in love. I loved how sweet their relationship was, Kenna had never known love or stability like it before and Scotty gave her all that and more.His parents didn't approve of Kenna, the one time she went to their house to meet them they heard her and Scotty have sex, saw her holding Scotty's cigarette, and assumed it was hers and as Kenna never had a good relationship with her own mother, she found it hard to talk to Scotty's mother Grace.My favorite Scotty and Kenna scene is definitely when they were at this shop looking at rings, and Kenna found the perfect one but it cost $4000, so instead, he bought her 10 little rubber hands that sit on the tip of your fingers. Later on, we find out that Scotty had in fact asked the help of his family to buy that expensive ring for when he was ready to propose to Kenna 😭I truly believe that Kenna is not over Scotty and never will be. Throughout the whole book I felt as if Scotty was developed more as a character/love interest than Ledger, circumstance brought Kenna and Ledger together with a sprinkle of lust.Legder- I was ready to crown Ledger as my fav CoHo book boyfriend, but honestly the energy of Ledger from the first few chapters until the end of the book? It was highly uninspired. He lacked depth as a character, we didn't know much about his personality at all apart from that he used to be a professional NFL player, was engaged to be married until a month ago, and owns a bar.Most of his personality was developed around him fighting the inner battle of believing whether Kenna is good or not. He was a nice enough hero, but there was nothing special or groundbreaking about him. I didn't believe in his love for Kenna, everything about their coupling felt forced and forged only by the bond they share through Diem and the loss of Scotty.He was a nice guy, then he was an asshole, then he was nice again and being concerned for Kenna's mental health, offering her a job, and wanting to kiss her even though he shouldn't. Once Kenna read her letter recounting the events of the accident out loud Ledger made his mind up. He fell in love with her.In the space of 200 pages he was so up and down I got whiplash but how are we expected to believe in their love when they maybe spent a few days in total together? Most of their interactions happened during brief encounters or him going to her apartment to say his piece and then going back. I feel like giving us the 'Reminders of Scotty' I fell more in love with him and Kenna than I did with her and Ledger.It wasn't a competition but the dead guy wins hands down.Me to Ledger:Grace & Patrick Landry- aka Scottys parents... I can sit here and tell you I felt for them. They lost their only son due to what they believe is a careless accident. Kenna in a fit of shock from the accident believes that Scotty is dead when she checks his hand/pulse(which also I'm sorry but Kenna could've checked other areas of Scotty's body like erm IDK HIS NECK before she ran from the scene thinking he's dead???)and runs away to ask for help but then wakes up in her own bed the next day, when in reality Scotty was still alive, the hand she checked was crushed with the blood supply cut off.In the courtroom, Kenna showed no emotion outwardly, when inwardly she had accepted her sentence as her penance, which made Scotty's parents hate her even more. They had every right to feel and be upset, they took Diem and raised her for the first 5 years of her life, but when Kenna came back they were so terrified and full of hatred for her they took out a restraining order against her.I'm not going to sit here and shame them for their very human reaction, but what I will say is it's always hard to root for these characters when you can feel the pain of the main character who is portrayed as this villain. But what I really didn't like is how rushed the whole ending was, how as soon as they read Kenna's letter (with less than 50 pages to go towards the end of the book) everything was miraculously forgiven and Kenna FINALLY met her daughter (I repeat all of this happened within 50 odd pages).No. I do not want that. I wanted more of the angst and pain I was promised. All that emotional turmoil Kenna went through and suddenly everyone is welcoming her this quickly?? I needed them all to feel way more guilt than that!!!Kenna should've died period. Then we can see who would cry at her funeral 😂.I really wish the ending was a lot more impactful than the route that CoHo chose which was magically wrapping everything up with a pretty little bow and HEA. I didn't view this book as a romance, this to me was Kenna's book, and if something different happened such as Kenna leaving after cutting her losses and reuniting with Diem years later? Her publishing a book of her letters and Diem finding her through that? Grace & Patrick forgiving Kenna regardless of the letter? I just wish more options were explored, rather than rushed.Roman- Ledger's best friend and one of the 3 side characters that were the stars of this book for me. We can call him a semi-grump, but can we all band together and think of ways to destroy cupcake shop girls' marriage so Roman can have her? I love a good unrequited/forbidden love. I loved the little bits of Roman we got, he was the only one who was understanding towards Kenna and didn't judge her for her mistakes. This man was delicious and he wasn't even the hero.“You think she cooks as good as she bakes?”“Hopefully one day I find out. Almost one out of every two couples divorce,” he says, his voice hopeful.“I bet Whitney could find you a nice single girl to date.”“Fuck you,” he mutters. “I’d rather wait until Cupcake Girl’s marriage falls apart.”Diem- unfortunate name aside(I got the sentiment from Kenna but really girl??? if she gets bullied, at least I know my girl will be able to defend herself)she was a queen. authors who write funny children have my heart and Diem was the funniest and sweetest girl. I want whatever Diem is eating.“D, you can’t take all the T-balls.”“They’re dragon eggs,” she says. “I’m going to plant them in my yard and grow baby dragons.”“It takes more than a wish to make a sibling.”“I know. We have to buy an egg from Walmart. That’s how babies grow.”Lady Diana aka Lucy- Is Lady Diana my favorite CoHo character ever? yes. as she deserves. LD lives in Kenna's apartment complex, works at the same grocery store as Kenna, befriends her as her first friend, and has Down's Syndrome. I love how welcoming and protective of Kenna she is, so much so she calls Ledger a jerk after he makes her cry. Look at this iconic behavior, your favs could NEVER:“Are you leaving with the jerk?” she asks Kenna.“You can stop calling him a jerk now. His name is Ledger.”Lady Diana looks me up and down and then mutters, “Ledgerk.”When she finds a cute guy and proclaims that she will marry him, LD knows her priorities:“Is he nice?” I ask her.“He has a PlayStation.”“But is he nice?”“He has lots of Pokémon cards.”“Is he nice, though?” I repeat.She shrugs. “I don’t know. I’ll have to ask him.”💙 Overall Thoughts 💙Reminders of Him was a thoughtful and poignant story of a woman who was dealt one too many bad hands in life, making a way for herself in the shattered remainders of the life stolen from her. Colleen did a great job in making us feel every bit of Kenna's pain and root for her reunion with Diem which should have been epic and heartfelt.But overall the pacing of the story was off, rapid in some places(such as the ending, romance between Ledger and Kenna)and dragging in others(how long it took for her to meet Diem, the focus on secondary characters, which I enjoyed reading about but felt the focus was shifting too much). The emotional impact of the story was lacking for me, bar the times I teared up for Kenna.This book needed another 100 pages minimum just to really solidify the plot, emotional connections, and ending. I would still recommend this as a read for those of you who enjoy Colleen's emotional books such as:It Ends with Us&All Your Perfects.",3
1189,Reminders of Him,"5 starsColleen Hoover always brings the feels with her contemporaries. I went into this one blind, like I always try to do with her books, and I was overcome with all I felt. It brought me to tears more than once and it had deep and heavy topics, but also moments of lightness that made me laugh. I love books that can do both. It’s the perfect balance.Some mistakes are bigger than others. Some mistakes are life changing. Life ending. Kenna is at a place she hasn’t been in five years and she’s there for a reason. Or a person. One of the main themes in this book is forgiveness. Kenna struggles with forgiving herself and others struggle to forgive her.Ledger meets Kenna and he doesn’t know who she is at first. He’s drawn to her. It’s almost magnetic. Once he finds out who she is he struggles with how he should feel about her. Ledger was the perfect hero, and one of this authors best characters. Kenna was also great and getting to know her through her letters to Scotty made me love her even more.I love that Colleen let us feel for Kenna and gave us so much insight in her heart and head through letters that when we found out what had happened, we couldn’t help but feel sympathy for her. I was sympathetic towards everyone in this book. Each of their situations were unique and I could understand why they felt the way they felt. There were no good guys or bad guys, just imperfect human beings.Like a lot of Hoover’s books, even though I would definitely classify this as a romance, it wasn’t only a romance. There were so many other facets to this story. It was a story of family, forgiveness, grief, and love. It’s heartfelt, emotional, and truly unforgettable.Reminders of Himis a book that will be on my mind for some time, as well as my favorites list!

1190,Reminders of Him,"3.5No one is more sad than me that I didn't love this book. I've only seen rave reviews, so I was expecting to love this one, but it didn't really feel special? It just felt like an emotional romance about a woman trying to get her daughter back after being in prison for five years. This read much more women's fiction until about 200 pages in when the romance started to get more focus. Since this is a Colleen Hoover book, I was expecting something shocking or some sort of twist somewhere throughout the book, but nothing like that happened. Everything, to me, was predictable and I saw every plot point coming. And the ending was so convenient and just wrapped up so quickly. One thing was the answer to all of their problems and that caused the ending (sorry for being vague, but I don't want to spoil anything).I will say, this is a book that will make you frustrated on behalf of all of the characters. There is no easy answer for anything and you understand why all of the characters are making the decisions they make. I felt for these characters, but there was just nothing special about this book. It was an emotional story about a woman in a helpless situation wanting to be part of her daughter's life. There was a bit of a romance. That's really it.",3

1192,Reminders of Him,colleen hoover better pay for my therapy after what this book just put me through,5
1193,Reminders of Him,"dnf @69%Yes, I made it roughly 70% through this tragic book before I allowed myself the grace to stop reading it.I wanted to like it! I really did, I swear.But I had a lot of problems with it.Kenna has been in prison for the last five years for involuntary manslaughter. She hit her boyfriend with her car while drunk, wandered away from the crash site, leaving him for dead. When her prison sentence is over, she uses her savings to move to the small town where her 4-year-old daughter, Diem, resides with Scotty's parents. Kenna gave birth to her daughter at the very beginning of her prison sentence and all of her rights were terminated.On her first night in the city, she goes to a bar, where she meets a very handsome bartender. Only later, as she is kissing him, does she realize that he's her dead boyfriend's best friend.She keeps kissing him anyway and they almost have sex in his truck.Ledger puts some pieces together early on in the book and figures out who Kenna really is.Asidefrom the whole still-kissing-Ledger-when-she-knows-he's-her-dead-boyfriends-best-friend thing, my heart truly went out to Kenna in this story. I think that's why I kept reading for so long, I was waiting for everyone to have empathy for her, to try to put themselves in her shoes and forgive her.I mean- imagine how traumatic it would be if you accidentally killed the love of your life, and the only thing he left you with was immediately taken away from you as soon as it came into existence?? That is freaking devastating.And no one in this book gives a f77king sh2t.First thing's first, everyone in this book except for Kenna, Scotty, Lady Diana, and the grocery store managercompletely sucked.Ledger and Scotty's parents- bad. I did not like them.They all make Kenna out to be this cold-blooded murderer, who hit Scotty with her car and then left him for dead on purpose because she was ""trying to get away with murder."" Like- SHE WAS LITERALLYSH8T FACED DRUNK.I get that they're upset about their son and they want someone to blame, but we are adults here, people. Freaking adults, act like it.Ugh.Ok, let's talk about Ledger.First of all, why does Colleen Hoover give all of her characters made-up trailer trash names? Why?Aside from Ledger'sincrediblyridiculous name, he is an awful human being. He is just plain selfish. I understand him acting the way he did when he didn't know who Kenna was, and maybe being a little upset she didn't say anything and kept kissing him when she figured out who he was. Understandable. What Idon'tunderstand is everything he did that came after that. He has-noempathy for Kenna, is completely disgusted with her, and the whole time he goes on about how Kenna is ""just using him to get to Diem"" when he's the one who keeps randomly picking her up in his truck and inserting himself into her life.And then he offers her a job- to help her out. Well, ok. But he only gives her the job because he has feelings for her. And the whole time he's being an ass to her and saying she's scum, and then he's getting all salty and possessive when shetalks to her co-workers.PUH-LEASE. Not to mention that he's her boss at this point and he knows he's one of her only sources of income, he keeps putting her in sexual situations where it's arguably hard for Kenna to say no.And I know that Kenna likes Ledger, for some reason. I know this. But it just seems so hypocritical of Ledger to tell Kenna that she's using him to get to her daughter when he's the one who's shoving his tongue down her throat and coaxing her into having sex with him.Also, Ledger kept harassing Kenna to show him the letters she writes to Scotty and that is totally none of his business. She said no. When a woman says no, you don't keep asking her until she says yes.I feel like overall... this was just executed poorly. The male lead was a hot and cold mess and the romance felt forced. The point where I had to stop reading this was when Kenna and Ledger finally had sex, it just felt so off and weirdly paced.I wish this book had more prison stories and flashbacks with Scotty, those were the parts that I actually enjoyed.Overall, disappointed. /:",1

1195,Reminders of Him,"Wow,this was a super tough read.Colleen Hoover is known for having super emotional romance stories and this book is no exception. Sometime I'd feel so frustrated with these characters I'd want to scream and then the next page I'd be crying. Ledger is definitely the highlight of this story for me, I felt so much for his character and he gets put in such an awkward situation in this book.I love that I can always count on Collen Hoover books to make me feel ALL of the things!

1196,Reminders of Him,"One of my all time favourites now......I cannot stop crying.... save me....""Now that I've forgiven myself, the reminders of him only make me smile.""The part she mentions the title of her books brings me so much relief everytime... because she had told the most parts of her stories by then and I can totally understand what she means each time.A wholesome read. Made me f cry the entire last fifty pages or so.My heart is not broken anymore after reading this wholesome book.Here we are following a story of a woman who is trying to make things work after being in jail for a crime she’s not wholly responsible of.She has to find her child and start living a normal life. But life isn’t that easy.And then there’s this guy who’s been bringing up this adorable child.With a friend he has lost and busy running a bar, he wouldn’t let the one who has ruined his friend’s family to interfere with his life.But then again life isn’t that easy to predict.I absolutely adore this story. I cried when the book hit the last fifty pages or so. It’s totally heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.The book is about hope, new beginnings and love. It’s about losing someone close to you and grief. But it is also about family and remembrance.One of my all time favourites now....I wish there were more parts of the kid Diem.... She's an awesome kid. I want a second part of the book.I need the connection between the child and the adult characters. I miss that in the entire book.",5
1197,Reminders of Him,"5 heart-wrenching stars ♥︎*trigger warnings listed at the bottom*“People say you fall in love, but fall is such a sad word when you think about it. Falls are never good. You fall on the ground, you fall behind, you fall to your death.”Okay CoHo, You finally wrote a book that made me cry.THIS WAS A FUCKING PIGEON.I can now say that I have loved two books by her out of what I have read thus far, but truly this one takes the cake. Consumed it in one sitting. I felt every emotion from every side and had a complete understanding of each side's views. I felt like I was being pulled back and forth in a battle of loyalty and betrayal just like Ledger.“It was a stark realization that no matter how much you love someone, you can still do despicable things to them.”It's been just over five years since the night that changed everything forKenna Rowan. An accidental tragedy at her hand sent her to prison where she gave birth to a baby girlDiem, never to be in her custody. Now that Kenna is released, she is determined to earn forgiveness and finally meet her four-year-old daughter, but they want nothing to do with her. She finds comfort and support fromLedger Ward, someone who she never thought would ever give her the light of day.“It proves that time, distance, and devastation allow people enough opportunity to craft villains out of people they don’t even know.”This book really makes you see the grey areas of the comparable black and white. Not everything is what it seems and without even trying to understand the full picture for your own benefit, you are closing off the peace you utterly are craving. This book was depressingly dark in a way I never want to experience—there's a difference between being alone and being lonely. Now add trauma and regret on top of that.“Grudges are heavy, but for the people hurting the most, I supposeforgiveness is even heavier.”I couldn't help but root for Kenna—no matter the circumstance, I feel a mother should have the right to have a relationship with their child or at least know them. I couldn't help my anger and frustration over her being closed off and pushed away without any chance at redemption or chance at showing her true character. Accidents happen, and based on the evidence, things were not looking great for Kenna, however, everyone deserves that opportunity.“Crying seems to be the only thing left in life that I’m good at. Crying and making bad decisions.”When all the odds are against you and nobody is in your favor and you just CAN'T catch a break, you become broken. Luckily, Kenna was able to get Ledger on her side but that doesn't mean the journey wasn't rocky and chaotic. This truly felt like a no-win kind of story and I knew that when it came to fighting for what was needed, it was going to be painful and outright heartbreaking.“Is that . . . is that a fucking pigeon?”The storm aside, this was a complete and happy ending and the epilogue had tears streaming from my eyes in stinging happiness. Kenna was so deserving of the life she ended up with and everyone could finally be at peace. ""Hi Scotty"" <3“Now that I've forgiven myself, the reminders of him only make me smile.”*Trigger warnings*:Suicidal thoughts, (somewhat) detailed scene of a tragic car wreck with driver under the influence, child neglect of mc (talks of foster care), (light speak) misuse of prescription drugs",5
1198,Reminders of Him,"UPDATE: despite EVERYTHING this book made it to the final round of the Goodreads Choice Awards; we really do be living in a society... 🤡______________The only person I would finish this book for is my dog...if you held him at gunpoint.It's been some time since I wrote one of my rant reviews and I know some of my mutuals think them peak entertainment so here we goooooo:Reminders of Himwas a book so not to my liking that I DNF-ed after the first few chapters (I literally NEVER DNF, like EVER).This was my first ever CoHo book and boy, if I had known what burning dumpster-fire of reeking red flags had awaited me...Synopsis:After serving five years in prison for a tragic mistake, Kenna Rowan returns to the town where it all went wrong, hoping to reunite with her four-year-old daughter. But the bridges Kenna burned are proving impossible to rebuild. Everyone in her daughter’s life is determined to shut Kenna out, no matter how hard she works to prove herself. The only person who hasn’t closed the door on her completely is Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to Kenna’s daughter. But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an important part of Kenna’s life, both would risk losing the trust of everyone important to them.Alright, I thought to myself.That doesn't sound too bad. This could be a solid story.And the first chapter was alright. We learn that Kenna is a 27-year-old mother who was sent to prison because of a deadly car accident involving her then boyfriend Scotty. She was pregnant at the time and gave birth to her daughter in prison. Now she's back in Scotty's home-town and the first thing she does is seek out the bookshop she used to frequent with him. Only that the bookshop is now a bar owned by, guess who??? Yep, you got it!Her ex's former best friend, Ledger!Queue Ledger's POV who pulls his truck into the alley behind his bar only to notice that one of his fingernails is still painted from when he played dress-up with hisfour-year-oldthe previous night. Hmmmmmm, Kenna's daughter is the same age.Now, we have Kenna walking into the bar who is so naturally stunning and pretty, the second Ledger lays his eyes on her he""overfill[s] the glasses and water goes everywhere"". Listen, love-at-first-sight might be some people's favourite trope but it sure as hell isn't mine. Reading that gave me second-hand embarrassment. Where is the build-up? The romantic tension? You want me to root for these two dumb-asses but then give me nothing to root for because they're in love the second they meet??Switch to Kenna's POV who writes a therapeutic letter to Scotty, telling him that she kissed a prison guard once, and that""it had been two years since [she] had been touched by [Scotty], so when he pressed [her] against the wall and gripped [her] waist, [she] thought [she]'d feel more.""Yeah, bestie, uh uh, we're not doing this. Back to jail.But let's move on to Ledger who's""good looking in a way that a girl who is trying to get custody of her daughter should want to stay away from"".A lot of words and I still don't know what he looks like. Oh wait,""he's got eyes that have seen a thing or two, and hands that have probably hit a man or two.""So I'm guessing he looks like this??Ledger, on the other hand, who just met this woman, who's known her for all but 20 minutes, is sure that Kenna's face is""a work of art""and god, how he wishes""there was a picture of it hanging on a wall in a museum somewhere so [he] could stand in front of it and stare at it for as long as [he] wanted.""Not the ""face is a painting and belongs in museum"" trope, I beg thee. 😭When their fingers touch for the first time Ledger obviously feels like there's""an erupting volcano""trapped in his chest. What else could it be? When two straight people of the opposite gender touch each other and there are no sparks, it wouldn't be a romance novel, would it?Kenna leaves the bar though not without having Ledger run after her to tell her to come back that night. My fellow readers. You have one guess:Does the main protagonist heed the summons of a man she barely knows to return to his bar at closing time, when she'd be the only one there? Of course, she does.All she can concentrate on when she's back is how often he points at things.""Two guys get into an argument, but he doesn’t care—he just points to the door and they leave. He does that a lot. Points at things, and people just do the things he points out for them to do. He points at two customers while making eye contact with the other bartender. That bartender walks up to them and closes out their tabs.""When she is about to leave and he motions her to sit back down again all she can think of is that""[she] had no idea pointing was sexy.""GURRRRLLL, I know you spent the last five years in prison but surely you can't be THAT DESPERATE for some D???But hold on, that wasn't even the best-worst line because that was undoubtedly:""He touches his hair now, pushing it back, staring down at me.There’s a war in his eyes, and I am by no means Switzerland, but he comes to me anyway.""Ayoooooooo??!! 😩😭Anyway, Kenna rightly decides that""talking will only get [her] into trouble""but what does she do instead? She slides onto his lap and immediately starts making out with him. Yes, our girl IS that desperate. Straight romances, I swear???There sure is and it's getting bigger with every straight romance book.",1
1199,Reminders of Him,"IS THAT A FUCKING PIGEON??? no, it’s just another book of colleen hoover breaking my heart.This story was beautifully painful and i bawled my eyes out in almost every page but it was worth it. Kenna, i just wanted to give her a hug she was misunderstood and deserved everything good. I loved how Ledger didn’t give up on her, kinda hated him at first but then he got me. I kept saying one more chapter and now it’s 6 am. I LOVED IT",5
1200,Reminders of Him,4.5 stars! Eee Colleen Hoover does it again. I love Kenna and Ledger so much and their love for Diem. Such a heart felt book with so much depth. Colleen Hoover really got me crying in another book 😭❤️ really loved this book,4
1201,Reminders of Him,"UPDATE: THIS BOOK NEEDS TO BE TURNED INTO A MOVIE😢💕!!!! Also, this book deserves an infinity star rating✨💗!!! Still thinking about this book till this day 05/06/2022!! Colleen Hoover still owes me boxes of tissues😪!!!!""Is that a fucking pigeon"". Every time this quote came up in the book it just made me laugh so much I cried!!!OH MY GOSH!!! This book was so heart wrenching!!!! Reminders of Him by Colleen Hoover was beautifully written, but yet so heartbreaking. The amount of tissues I went through was unbelievable. Thank you Colleen for leaving me so empty, the amount of tears I shed was insane! I cried my eyes out like there was no tomorrow! Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. This will be a story that stays with me forever. I cried, I cheered for Kenna, I cheered for Ledger. I was one ugly sobbing mess. If you have never read a book by Colleen Hoover before, you will never know the pain that goes along with reading her books. My heart was broken, my eyes were red and puffy from crying while reading this amazing story. Colleen you owe me a couple boxes of tissues😭💔!!!A troubled young mother yearns for a shot at redemption in this heartbreaking yet hopeful novel by Colleen Hoover. Kenna, Diem, and Ledger will be in my heart for a long time to come. I would love a sequel of this book as Diem's POV after meeting Kenna.After serving five years in prison for a tragic mistake, Kenna Rowan returns to the town where it all went wrong, hoping to reunite with her four year old daughter, Diem. Kenna and her boyfriend Scotty were driving to the lake one night from a party when Kenna and Scotty were both too drunk and too high to drive. But Kenna chose to get behind the wheel anyways. Kenna and Scotty were on a deserted gravel country road when Kenna was speeding and lost control of their car and left Scotty to die. In the time Kenna was looking for help she didn't know Scotty was still alive until the next morning when the police showed up at her apartment and arrested her. At the time of Kenna's trial, she didn't know she was pregnant, otherwise she wouldn't have pleaded guilty. Diem was born a preemie and was handed into the arms of her grandparents, Scotty's family. Kenna lost anything to do with her daughter while she was serving her time, she couldn't even hold Diem the minute she was born.But the bridges Kenna burned are proving impossible to rebuild. Everyone in her daughter's life is determined to shut Kenna out, no matter how hard she proves herself. The only person who hasn't closed the door on Kenna completely is Ledger Ward, a local bar owner and one of the few remaining links to Kenna's daughter. Ledger was Scotty were best friends but Kenna never met him before Scotty's death. But if anyone were to discover how Ledger is slowly becoming an important part of Kenna’s life, both would risk losing the trust of everyone important to them. The two form a connection despite the pressure surrounding them, but as their romance grows, so does the risk. Kenna must find a way to absolve the mistakes of her past in order to build a future out of hope and healing. The letters Kenna wrote Scotty destroyed me😭💔!!!!",5
1202,Reminders of Him,i’m ugly crying in my bed because this story was so heartbreakingly beautiful! my fav coho book ever! a piece of my heart will forever be stuck in these pages! 💕,5
1203,Reminders of Him,"WOW— You know what I would call this? a masterpiece. that’s what. This story was somehow heartbreaking & heartwarming at the same time.. in a way only Colleen Hoover can write. I was so attached to these characters, and I just wanted to reach into the book and give them all a million hugs. The way the cover and the title click when you finish is one of my favorite things in the world. I came, I saw, I cried, I laughed, I conquered. I am overall very happy with this book, and I think you all will be too <3 me getting this ARC was definitely the highlight of my life and I can now go to bed happy.",5
1204,Reminders of Him,"3.25 StarsOh my, Mother of Traumatizing Calamity! Ironically, this is the ✨BLANDEST�� CoHo’s ever been.First of all, CoHo should’ve made this into a THRILLER cause I think the premise would make for a better romantic suspense than whatever this ended up being. Alas, this book showed that the Queendidindeed MISS once in a while. 🤷‍♀️Second, it’s only the first month of 2022, and here’s CoHo wreaking havoc on my heart with another one of her tragedies. Again. 😢 And this time, she even managed to drag COLDPLAY into it. What a travesty! 😒Third,seriously though, this woman has an unhealthy fascination with ‘dramatic’ accidents and car wrecks. Her books should be the poster child for road traffic safety or automobile/home insurance company. 💀🚘Kenna Rowanis an ex-con who served her five year sentence in prison for involuntary manslaughter of her then still alive boyfriend. Upon discharging, she’s looking to start over and reconnect with the daughter she carried and birthed during her serving time but never had the chance to hold.The romance comes in when she meets ex-football player and current bar owner,Ledger Ward, whom she immediately feels mutual attraction to. Unfortunately, ✦bad timing✦ and any hope of pursuing anything more is quickly dashed when they find out who the other personreallyis.Ledger is Kenna’sdead boyfriend’s (Scotty)best friendwho’s been taking care of her daughter along with Scotty’s parents.It’s not CoHo if it isn’t full of painful truths. This book explores how unfair the world is towards ex-felons, especially female ones, and the challenges they face in navigating life after prison. It also highlights how powerless they are, especially those who also happen to bemothers. I didn’t outrightly cry, but this book did get me teary eyed.The Mother/Daughter ReunionI don’t think this part is handled particularly well. Not that it didn’t break my heart seeing Kenna’s longing for her child and her struggle as well as desperation to see her. However, I’m disappointed that Kenna didn’t try harder to fight for her daughter. Not that there was anything much she could do in her position. But she only tried once, got rejected by the people in her daughter’s life, and was ready to give up. I feel like she should’ve made more plans, taken more steps, be more persistent.I’m disappointed at Kenna’s acceptance and constant understanding of the animosity she received from the people in her daughter’s life. She believed she wasn’t a bad person and hoped for forgiveness and redemption, but she didn’t do much to reach for them.I don’t necessarily want this book to be all about Kenna’s efforts to reunite with her daughter to the point that it overshadowed the romance, but the fact that it sortawas, yet I still found it lacking was most ironically dismaying.The Romance“Maybe it doesn’t matter whether something is a coincidence or a sign. Maybe the best way to cope with the loss of the people we love is to find them in as many places and things as we possibly can.”Idk what to think of the romance. I think it was poorly written. Kenna and Ledger didn’t fall in love under the best of circumstances, but I’m afraid Ledger might just be a consolation prize for Kenna. I’m not sure if Kenna was over her grief and already moved on from her dead boyfriend. Also, the fact that she still wrote him letters, I don’t know what to make of that. I loved that we saw glimpses of their relationship from those letters. At the same time, it only emphasized how much she loved him.By the end of the book, I didn’t feel assured that Ledger was not just a replacement. Not to mention, the dilemma and the guilt they had to deal with because of who Ledger was to her dead boyfriend. Makes me think, what if they’d met when he was still alive?They fell in love because of that one common denominator, but I also wanted to see them fall for each other without that shared grief and pain.I suppose, it served him right cause for a romance H, Ledger sure tasted like unseasoned crackers. 🤪The Accident[SPOILERS!!!]For the majority of the book, I kept waiting for that one mindblowing twist that CoHo is known for, butthe fact that THERE’S NOT ONE SINGLE PLOT TWIST (besides Ledger the BFF) is utterly disappointing, disappointingly underwhelming, and very unbecoming of CoHo. It was hard to comprehend and accept that the accident happened because Kenny was being careless and irresponsible. Even when she described it in detail near the end of the book, the logic was somewhat lost on me.How can a person be disastrously stupid? 😫 Not that I’ve ever been in a car crash. I’ve been in a motorbike crash TWICE, but both were minor and I wasn’t the driver. It didn’t feel great, but it didn’t send me into a tailspin of panic the likes of Kenna’s either, so I guess I shouldn’t judge. In any case,somehow I expected the accident to be a misunderstanding.And perhaps, the plot twist would be her dead boyfriend being the driver/the one at fault; hence, Kenna was falsely accused, but she accepted her sentence cause she felt guilty. I mean, wouldn’t that be more epicly plausible???“Sometimes I wonder if we’re all born with equal amounts of good andevil. What if no one person is more or less malevolent than another, and thatwe all just release our bad at different times, in different ways?”Closing Thoughts . . .I suppose the point of all this is to show that no matter how tiny the mistake you make, it can have insurmountable consequences. But it shouldn’t be theonlything that defines you for the rest of your life as long as the path to forgiveness and redemption is open and you’re willing to take the journey (which Kenna kinda did, but it was unconvincing?). 🏃‍♀️Reminders of Himwas a tough read, but it didn’t hit as hard as CoHo’s other books. Usually, I’d be deeply affected by her stories no matter that I ended up loving or hating them. This one fell somewhat in the middle. 😪 I think it could’ve benefited from a longer page count.In my opinion, the plot was underdeveloped. The romance was uninspired. The lack of plot twist was THE plot twist itself. 🤯 The ending was rushed and wrapped up too neatly. The side characters were more interesting than the MCs. The pacing felt off.Overall, it was an emotional read that made my eyes water, but ultimately it read like a typical women’s fiction (that was evidently “CoHo,” but didn’t bear her special trademark). I don’t think this is amustread for CoHo fans, but if you have FOMO, then I suggest don’t come in with high expectations. Maybe then you’d appreciate the book more than I did. ✋(Read as an Audiobook)",3

1206,Reminders of Him,"Unfortunately, Reminders of Him simply didn’t resonate with me. I kind of feel like I read a different book than everyone else as I didn’t connect with the storyline or the characters. I couldn’t help but roll my eyes throughout and felt that the entire book was OTT. This is perhaps only the second book of COHO’s that I didn’t care for. It is what it is.I’m only one reader so I think it’s clearly a case of me being the wrong reader for this novel.Published on Goodreads.",2
1207,Reminders of Him,"⭐️/ 5 stars:Coho’s books: two characters having a sudden urge to have sex within 30 pages of the book, despite them not knowing a thing about each other.Edit: I am laughing at the amount of likes I am getting. The book was so bad and nothing but a hallmark plot line. Everything was just so basic and bland to me. It was boring. I do believe coho relies heavily on her “heartbreaking” elements to make people cry. I didn’t shed a single tear in this book, not even in her other books😂.Rant:I hate this book. Don't get me started on the one-dimensional characters.Ledger is NOT the blueprint. He is only “hot”. He was a boring love interest.Lady Diana is a stupid name for a teenager in this book. She was also boring.Patrick and Grace were only grandparents. That's it, that's all. They did not have personalities.The friends, Roman and ravi, we're merely apart of the story. We only knew that Roman is, in fact, a black male. Why??????The plot:It was weak.I don't care too much about the moral of the story.I get it, but it is too weak for me..It gave too much wattpad. It was basic.It was a good idea/moral, but the wrong execution.It makes since in my head, but it was so mediocre to me that it is hard to articulate.Relationship:Keena and ledger’s relationship was FORCED!!I say this because there was no chemistry between them. It was just lust from day one. Too insta love for me. They didn't even know each other.Ending:The ending was too fast to me. It only took ledger printing out a paper to give to grace and Patrick and all was forgiven?????It would have had a better effect had they just invited keena to their house to have a conversation.G and P accepted Ledger and keena’s relationship too easily for me. Only because of how ledger looked at keen. Wow!! What happened to “i am so hurt by what she did”?Don't get me started on the epilogue. Why????She was ok with having a baby by her boyfriend's best friend??? She even named him Scotty???Coho gave us a 335-page long book for everything to be so rushed at the end. Lol",1
1208,Reminders of Him,"I think this is one that will go down as more enjoyable because I listened to it. I always love the Brittany Pressley and Ryan West duo combo narration. Had I read this one I don't think it would have captured much of my attention.This is my third Colleen Hoover book. She's a good storyteller but in this particular one I was not quite feeling the characters or the romance aspect. Kenna, has been in prison for 5 years for a terrible accident. Her child has been in the care of her grandparents. Upon her release she is determined to get her daughter back and make an amends.I was frustrated with the characters and part of the story but I did feel Kenna's helplessness. It's an emotional story but yet did not fully grab me. The romance was minimal and I did not feel the magic with the couple. I was happy with the overall ending.",3
1209,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","Shit seriously just went down.Oh wow, where do I start with this sequel? I wasn't even sure I was going to read it when I recently finishedThrone of Glassand found it entertaining but a poor excuse for fantasy. You want to know whatCrown of Midnightfelt like? It was like the author listened to every piece of criticism I could have thrown at the first book, listened to everything I loved and everything that irritated me... and then wrote a perfect kind of book. The kind I wanted the first one to be; the kind I hadn't dared to hope she might produce in this sequel. There was more action, more nastiness, more character development, more surprises, more complications, more sexy, no love triangle - all of this and a well-placed, never-saw-it-coming twist. Ms Maas, consider me impressed.Crown of Midnighttakes a huge step away from the tame romantic/bitchy drama of its predecessor and opens up a story that is a bigger, bloodier and meaner than I think many readers will be expecting. Celaena gets to fully explore all aspects of what it means to be an assassin in this book; she is tested constantly and you can see her growing and changing and learning as the story progresses. And this story is one tumultuous journey of extremely high ups and unbelievably low downs with Celaena taking relationships to all new levels and watching others fall apart. Old enemies resurface and we start to get a glimpse of just how big the picture Maas is painting for us actually is.One of the strengths of this book is having no idea how it's going to end. You might think that's a given, butThrone of Glassintroduced us to a plot that was fairly easy to see mapped out. We are told of the challenges Celaena must compete in and win, we know that's what the book is moving towards, and it isn't too much of a leap to assume that (one way or another) Celaena is going to emerge victorious. Not in this book. This book starts with a blank slate, any mysteries or troubles that are to come are completely unknown to us - so every turn the plot takes is a surprise and every surprise is thrilling. I can't wrap my head around justhow much betterthis sequel is. Maas has already grown as a writer and storyteller, making me wonder what she can possibly have in store for us next.The characters are also so much better developed in this book. Maas is brave enough here to allow the main characters to make mistakes, do the wrong things and test our ability to like them. Well, I don't know about you, but the new dimensions to their personalities, their faults and weaknesses, only served to make me like them more. Dorian surprised me most of all. InThrone of Glass, Dorian feels like something of a plot tool, a pretty little obstacle to Celaena and Chaol's romance. The scenes with him felt like filler between the parts I was actually waiting for. But not inCrown of Midnight! In this, Dorian emerges as an interesting character with secrets of his own; he makes sacrifices for the people he loves and his importance to the bigger story starts to become apparent.In short?Throne of Glass...Romance, love triangle, pretty dresses, one-dimensional characters, little action...Crown of Midnight...Badassery, twists, nastiness, betrayal, more action, magic, secrets...If you were so-so about the first one and considering *maybe* reading this, you have my thumbs up.",5
1210,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺Chaol Westfall, a well-trained, muscular grown-ass man, Captain of the Royal Guard: *gets all soft and smooshy in this book*me: *needs to wrap him in a blanket, feed him some good hot Romanian rice pudding with lemon and sour cherry jam and protect him from the rest of the world because he is that precious*-	Actual plans that I really think about considering in a very serious wayAfter reading the first book of the series,Throne of Glass, I knew that I enjoyCrown of Midnight, but I’d never anticipated I’d enjoy itthat much.I've decided to read this book in a teeny-tiny complicated period of my life: I've been categorized by my ophthalmologist (cuz yeah, I wear glasses and not one buttwopairs, one of them being for reading, cuz yeah, my blind arse doesn't see well enough) as a ""are case"" and my eyes are „smashed"" because of too much reading and it's not normal. Sooo I've been put through an ""a carrot a day"" cure and also ""only 30 minutes of reading"" cure. Because of that, I was not able to actually read as much as I wanted. But this book is giving to me a dependence that I am totally approving of, made me read so super-humanly fast that I've managed to actually read enough in a day to accumulate the plot, the characters' stories and the magic happening in general in Sarah J. Maas’ world.This book was better than the first book from the beginning. I think it is so much easier to get into the second book of the series because you have the advantage of the first one. In some series, the second, third, fourth etc. books are not as good as the first one. But in this series, you can actuallysensethem getting better and better (or maybe this is only my opinion). So second book of the Throne of Glass series > the first book (but don’t get me wrong, Ilovedthe first book too).It is useless to talk about the plot at this point already: it’s the second book, some covered plans are being made in order to wipe the fussy king from the surface of this world. Talks about rebel alliances and plans and talks about some long-lost heir of Terrasen’s throne, Aelin Ashryver Galathynius start pumping the air of the book. Some think they are just rumours; some believe in them because their lives depend on these rumours. But until the end of the book, everything becomes just a huge ball of energy that absorbs everything (including your soul) and in my opinion, this is so important.Sarah J. Maas is, in my opinion, a genius mind. She makes us fall in love, she makes us sigh, get angry, cry, wanna die and so on. All these elements are important spices in the whole dish of a book. I don’t know about other people, every single person has a personal taste, but I really think that this whole series is based on a brilliant idea, also very good narrated, even though I’ve read only two books.Now, talking about spice, even though I am actually kind of a bit (more) in love with Dorian, the Crown Prince of Adarlan, and I think he is the most charming and witty son of a wicked king I’ve encountered (since present moment) in any of my reads (remember that I am fairly new to YA Fantasy club) and I love his beautiful soul and the way he and Celaena work together, I cannot not be happy to see how the relationship between Celaena and Chaol Westfall, Captain on the Guard, grew. At least in this particular book, at this given moment. Even though some batshit happens and Celaena goes cuckoo bird.Going back, this book, the second book out of seven, blew my mind, made me laugh, made me sigh, made me cry, made me mad. And it was fantastic. Totally worth every single second I’ve spent reading it. I loved it.Also, Nehemia Ytger, thank you for existing, Queen!",5
1211,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","Wow! This was an exceptional sequel. I loved it so much! I feel like the series has more of a direction, which is exciting. I'm still processing everything that happened in this book, because SO MUCH HAPPENS. I'll be doing a full review/discussion soooooon.",5
1212,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","I'm not sure what to do right now.I just.... wow.The only reason this isn't rated higher is because the first half was quite slow in pace and I wasn't as invested, but the second half SURE DID REMEDY THAT. Help me?",4

1214,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","Celaena may be many things but she isnot a murderer.She is anassassin.There's a difference. (Probably.)He had no idea what sort of darkness lurked inside her, or what sort of monster she was willing to become in order to make things right.I honestly don't even know where to start with this one. It was so good and I'm just absolutely reeling from that ending. Because. Wow.Sarah J. Maas just delivered on this sequel.""Enough! We have enough enemies as it is! There are worse things out there to face!""Celaena slowly turned to him, her face splattered with blood and eyes blazing bright. ""No, there aren't,"" she said. ""Because I'm here now.""Celaena Sardothien ex-prisoner of the salt mines has risen to the position ofRoyal Assassin.She must follow every whim of her king for four years. Only then, will shefinally be freed.It was a hard bargain but Celaenathought she could handle it.She's killed many, many before - so how could killing for the King be any different?The Mad (or merely cruel?) King sees spies and traitors everywhere. He frequently sends her out to murder innocents. To murder -not to assassinate- and that makes all the difference.Very quickly Celaena finds ways to smuggle out these would-be-victims, but with the ever-rising number of ""survivors"" (any one of them could blow her cover), the ever-increasing threat from home and the reappearance of an oldfriend-how could she even hope to protect those who matter to her most?I absolutely love how our main character isconfident, beautiful and completely in control- it's such a refreshing change from all the awkward, please-tell-me-I'm-pretty and helpless heroines that populate many YA books.If they wanted Adarlan's Assassin, they'd get her.And Wyrd help them when she arrived.The side-characters are so well-done. There's a bit of a love-triangle. Normally, I'd run away screaming at the hint of a love triangle (I've suffered through so many terrible ones) but Sarah J. Maas executed it perfectly. (Is there anything that the Maas-ter can't do?)Plus, that ending justsucked out my last breath.It was such a twist and it was so incredibly badass. I loved it.Death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend these long, long years.If you haven't picked up this series yet - get it today. Seriously. Go.

1215,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","UPDATE: REVIEW 5++ STARSHoly mother of all Gods! I'm starstruck. This is what I'd like to call a gorgeous sequel. Dare I say it, it might even topThrone of Glass!Celaena Sardothien is doing her job as King's Champion, meaning she's killing people that stepped on the king's toes. And now she's got a new target: Archer Finn, former crush and friend from the time when she was within the Assassin’s Guild. Turns out, she's not killing her targets, but faking their deaths, so she's in a lot of danger if someone discovers her secret. The stakes are higher now that Archer is a well-known figure in Rifthold and that he might be involved in a rebel group. To make events even more complicated, the half-Fae and long-dead Queen, Elena, is asking Celaena to find the source behind the King's power.“Everything in this world is magic. Thank you ever so kindly for stating the obvious.”Celaena was a goddamn badass. I wouldn't mess with her in a thousand years. We finally see her wild and deadly side, the one that I've grown accustomed to in the prequel e-novellas and that wasn't fully explored inThrone of Glass. Sure, she's still that sassy, arrogant and sarcastic girl, but above all, she's an assassin. A ruthless killer. And when the ones she loves are in danger or threatened, she's unforgiving. That part of her really gives you goosebumps. Oh, and let's not forget when she's in for revenge. One word: lethal.She was a whirlwind of steel and blood. As he watched her cut through the men like they were stalks of wheat in a field, he understood how she had gotten so close to touching Endovier’s wall that day. And at last—after all these months—he saw the lethal predator he’d expected to find in the mines. There was nothing human in her eyes, nothing remotely merciful. It froze his heart.Dorian Havilliard. Chaol Westfall. Dorian, Chaol, Chaol, Dorian. Chaol is the same sweet, loyal, funny, protective and fierce warrior. I loved his easy banter with Celaena and his alpha-male demeanor. Prince Dorian Havilliard is still the same passionate, kind, intelligent young man that is slowly transforming into a great ruler. And they’re best friends! How can I choose?!*crying*“I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn't, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”InCrown of Midnight, Chaol and Celaena are getting close. Like really close. And because of that, both of their relationships with Dorian become more strained, awkward and tense. And that's kind of the single thing that bothered me at Celaena: inThrone of Glass, she was all over Dorian... and now? She doesn't care about his feelings when he clearly loves her. And that just got me going mad. I wanted to hug Dorian several times and give him cookies.Still, things evolve a little bit between them on a platonic level when a heartbreaking twist makes Celaena not trust Chaol anymore. And another unexpected twist involving Dorian makes things one hundred times more interesting.“When you do, I want you to remember that it wouldn’t have made any difference to me. It’s never made any difference to me when it came to you. I’d still pick you. I’ll always pick you.”I've read some reviews that say that the love triangle's fate is sealed after the first quarter of the book. But now, after reading it, I'm not so sure. Especially after that second half and killer ending. I love Chaol with all my heart, but I can't help but hope that Celaena will end up with Dorian. Now, now, don't throw stones at me! It’s still aCinderellainspired book! They're both swoony guys, but I've always loved Dorian a bit more. Might be because of the dark-haired, blue-eyed appearance. And possibly the arrogance. And the bookish and funny personality. Perhaps even the fact that he's a freaking prince.*dreamy sigh*“If you are captured, if you are hurt, you are beyond our reach. You will be entirely on your own.”“I’ll be fine.”“But I won’t be. Every day that you’re there, I will wonder what has become of you. I won’t.... I won’t forget you. Not for one hour.”Nehemia was such a great support for Celaena, even if she had her own agenda. The princess is one of those selfless characters that would give everything up for the sake of her people. She's fair, ambitious and dedicated. And she's the key-player that sets things in motion in this sequel. But in a gut-wrenching method that will surely have you shedding a few tears.The villain we love to hate: the King of Adarlan, Dorian's father. His plans turn out to be down-right evil and unnatural. I loathe that guy because he's so willing to exploit everyone around him for his own sake. I want himD.E.A.D.*guilty smile*As it was to be expected, we meet new characters. My favorite was Mort. Why? First of all, he's an ancienttalkingdoor knocker. Second of all, he's hilarious!When they left, Nehemia spent a few minutes studying Mort— mostly asking him questions about his creation spell, which he claimed to have forgotten, then claimed was too private, then claimed she had no business hearing.Archer Finn was hard to read, but I never trusted him behind all those pretty smiles and coward-like behavior. Never trust a courtesan. Oh, and of course, there's Baba Yellowlegs. Even the name gives you creeps. She's an old, manipulative witch whose favorite meal is consisted of young girls. Told you: creepy.The character development is really spectacular. You can see how Celaena, Chaol and Dorian grow. By the end of the novel, our heroine is not running from her past anymore; the Captain of the Guard is ready to sacrifice himself and face his father; and the Crown Prince starts to stand up to the King no matter the consequences.“Thank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian. Thank you for being my friend. For not being like the others.”The pace was definitely action driven. I'm not kidding when I'm saying that sooo much happened and some many plots started to unfold between my eyes. Crown of Midnight was a page-turner through and through and there was never a dull moment.“How long will you keep her here?” Dorian said, looking down the stairs.She had attacked the Captain of the Guard in front of his men. Worse than attacked.“As long as it takes,” Chaol said quietly.""For what?”“For her to decide not to kill us all.”Another think that surprised me was the fact that Celaena is keeping so many secrets I can't even keep count. There were two revelations regarding her: I suspected the one revealed in the end, but the other one totally caught me unprepared. Both are jaw-dropping twists that will completely change the outcome of her adventures.“I’ll come back,” she said quietly. “I’ll come back for you.”The world-building was exquisite! We learn so much more about Erilea, Adarlan and the history of the country. We delve deeper into the Fae magic. It's a top-notch high fantasy world, coupled with a darker atmosphere, mistery, magic and amazing characters. The result is a certain recipe for epicness, one that Sarah J. Mass gorgeously created with her mad writing skills.If you haven't started this series, I'm begging you -- pick it upASAP. It's complex, emotional and completely captivating. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll swoon, you'll gasp in shock and you'll fall in love with the story.Crown of Midnightwas an excellent follow-up that might not end in a claw-your-yes-out sort of cliffhanger, but it will make you crave the next installment like air. And man, what a ride that will be!*wink*ENJOY!<3You can also read this review here:http://raftul-cartilor-vampiresti.blo.............................................I NEED THIS BOOK!!!How can I wait another year??

Absolute game-changer.My heart was beating! It brought me right back to the first time I read this series and felt my obsession with it and Sarah J Maas brewing! I latched on to it. And I have fallen in love alllll over again! 😍There’s so much that I justfelt!Celaena’s character development in this, to her finally beginning to accept and deal with her past, to stop trying to escape what it is she is meant to be, was incredible to read.And it hit me again how much she actually has suffered, from the time she was 8 till now. The people that she has lost, the sacrifices she has made to try and keep her soul intact and completely close herself off to the torture she experienced. It was so painful to read.I’m so not ready and ready for Heir of Fire. Pure pain and excruciating growth resides in that book.",5

1219,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","“Some things you hear with your ears. Others, you hear with your heart.”To say Sarah J. Maas stepped up her game in the second book of her“Throne of Glass Series”most certainly would be the understatement of the century. No, scratch that, it actually doesn’t even get close to the truth. XDI swear in comparison to the first book this truly was an action packed and suspenseful read! =)Alone the many awesome fight scenes and the countless revelations throughout the entire book were already enough to cause my head to spin! Plus Celaena finally lives up to her reputation as Adarlan’s best assassin and actually kills people, which was amazing and involuntarily made me love this even more! *lol*Yes, Sarah can write and her action scenes always had me at the edge of my seat. Once or twice I might have even been close to falling off of my chair, but that’s another matter for another day! ;-PFor now all you have to know is that”Crown of Midnight”was an awesome read and that it was able to keep me on my toes and considering how many books I already read, this certainly should speak for itself. ;-)Since I don’t really feel like talking aboutthe plot(you’ll read plenty of it in my characters section aka The Spoilery Spoiler Section anyway) I’ll do something completely mean and will only give you a few words:Celaena, Chaol, Dorian, The King, Roland, Kaltain, Nehemia, Archer, missions, blood, death, creepy, magic, dungeons, books and let’s not forget about Fleetfoot!There you go! *lol* Haha! Oh Jeez that’s so vague you’ll hate me! XDWell, anyway! *smiles innocently*Let’s get to my favourite section!The characters:Do I still have to say it?! Yes? Okay! This is the aforementioned “Spoilery Spoiler Part” so if you don’t want to read quotes or spoilers or my crazy thoughts, you better stop now and never return. ;-P Don’t say I didn’t warn you!Celaena:”Some days, it feels like another person did those things. And most of those lives I’m glad I ended. No matter the cause, though, it – it still takes away a little piece of you each time. So I don’t think I’ll ever forget them.”Celaena is so kick-ass, I love her!!! We finally saw the relentless killer in her and I just couldn’t get enough of it! I thoroughly enjoyed all of the fighting scenes and the one with Baba Yellowlegs was definitely the best! XD I can’t wait to read more about those Ironteeth Witch Clans and I really hope they’ll be a part of the other books! Aside from the action I probably enjoyed Celaena’s character development the most. She’s no longer afraid to show her true self and she doesn’t only open up to Chaol but also to Dorian. I can’t say how much I loved all those new revelations about her and the fact that she’s fae took me entirely by surprise. I definitely didn’t expect that and I was like“WOAH WHAT?!!!”when I read it! I mean I always knew she had a secret and Sarah mentioned it often enough, I certainly didn’t expect it to be this kind of secret though!! *lol* I’m sure after the promise at Nehemia’s grave we can expect great things in the future and I’m so curious about Wendlyn; I immediately want to start with“Heir of Fire”.”I failed him,” she said. “In every way that counted, I failed him.”Another long silence, then a sigh. “Not in one way.” Chaol said. “I bet he would have wanted you to survive – to live. So you didn’t fail him, not in that regard.””I want you to know,” she whispered to the wind, to the earth, to the body far beneath her, “that you were right. You were right. I am a coward. And I have been running for so long that I’ve forgotten what it is to stand and fight.””The ship began moving. And Chaol – the man she hated and loved so much that she could hardly think around him – just stood there, watching her go.”Chaol:”She was a whirlwind of steel and blood. As he watched her cut through the men as though they were stalks of wheat in a field, he understood how she had gotten so close to touching Endovier’s wall that day. And at last – after all these months – he saw the lethal predator he’d expected to find in the mines. There was nothing human in her eyes, nothing remotely merciful. It froze his heart.”Ahh Chaol! My problem child! *sighs* I don’t hate him, actually I like him, butARGH!!!!He screwed up big time in this one and I just couldn’t believe what I read! I mean come on! You’re the Captain of the King’s Guard! You should be smarter than that!!! Seriously, in this book I really began to hate his loyalty to the king and it made me more than just angry that he never even thought about questioning the king’s orders! Chaol basically is the embodiment of the unthinking and unblinking soldier! Stupidly loyal to a fault!!! And that moment when he got kidnapped in his own domain?WHAT THE FREAKEDY FREAKING HELL?!Like: Are you kidding me!? I can’t help but wonder how he even became the Captain of the Guard. *lol* I’m so not impressed. Not at all! Plus he should have told Celaena about Nehemia, but he didn’t and that once again tells me that he still doesn’t trust her. At the end I felt kind of sad for him though. I mean he finally realised that he was blind and probably made the biggest mistake of his life. Unfortunately by then it was already too late to change anything about his misguided actions and he ended up suffering like crazy. Poor Chaol! =(”Once, Chaol might have argued. Once, he might have protested that his loyalty to the crown was his greatest asset. But that blind loyalty and obedience had started his descent.And it had destroyed everything.”But when Celaena walked out, leaving that damning will behind him, he didn’t even make it to his own room. He barely made it into an empty broom closet before the sobs hit.””But he could do this for her. Even if he never saw her again, even if she abandoned her duties as King’s Champion and stayed with the Fae in Wendlyn forever – as long as he knew that she was safe, that no one could hurt her … He’d sell his soul again and again for that.”Dorian:”You have power in you, Prince. More power than you realize.” She touched his chest, tracing a symbol there, too, and some of the court ladies gasped. But Nehemia’s eyes were locked on his. “It sleeps,” she whispered, tapping his heart. “In here. When the time comes, when it awakens, do not be afraid.” She removed her hand and gave him a sad smile. “When it is time, I will help you.”My charming and precious cutiepie!!!I love Dorian so damn much! He’s the best thing about the entire series and in“Crown of Midnight”he broke my heart. I suffered with him throughout the entire book and I really hate the idea that Sarah might make him a second Lucien. Neither of those two boys deserved what she put them through and I really hope she won’t continue to harm him in the next book. He’s just too pure for the world and he needs to be protected at all costs!!! Plus he’s amazing!!!I love the fact that he has raw magic in him and I see so much potential for the next few books! Still, his loneliness caused my heart to ache and I felt really sorry for him. He’s so alone and no one is there to help him, yet his first thought when he discovered that he had magic was that he needs to find out if his brother has it too. He wanted to protect Hollin and that’s so damn sweet! <33 Oh boy, how much I wanted to hug him when he frantically tried to hide his research in the library or when he was looking for Nehemia and waited in front of Celaena’s rooms. All this anger and despair - He doesn’t deserve it!!! Sarah, please have mercy on him!!!#TeamDorian forever and for always!!!!”How long have you been yearning for him? Was what he really wanted to ask. Damn him for caring. Damn him for every moment he’d spent with her.””How about you spend a year in Calaculla, and when you’re done, you two can sit here and tell me about your plans for expansion.””Something invisible slammed into the creature, sending it flying into the wall with a crunch. Gods. Dorian didn’t just have magic – he had raw magic. The rarest, and deadliest, kind. Sheer undiluted power, capable of being shaped into whatever form the wielder desired.”Nehemia:”I won’t deny that you have suffered, Elentiya, but there are thousands more who have also suffered – and suffered more. And they do not sell themselves to the king to get what they, too, deserve. With each person you kill, I am finding fever and fewer excuses for remaining your friend.”WHY SARAH!!!??Why did you have to kill Nehemia? She was such a lovely character and I didn’t expect her death! When Celaena found out about the King’s intentions I really thought that she’d be able to safe her or would at least come just in time to exchange some final words with her. But no! We found a dead Nehemia and Celaena never got a chance to fix things between them. T_T I hate it that they had an argument before she died and I really don’t like the way Nehemia had to die. I mean she didn’t even get a fighting scene. We’re presented with a fait accompli, which sucked! Well, at least in my opinion. So there’s that! Can’t say I feel sorry for Grave or Archer though. They had it coming and they should have known better than to mess with Celaena. *lol*”I have grown up knowing the weight of my crown. When the king invaded Eyllwe all those years ago, I knew that I would someday have to make choices that would haunt me.” She cupped her forehead in a palm. “I didn’t think it would be this hard. I cannot be in two places at once.””Nehemia was gone. That vibrant, fierce, loving soul; the princess who had been called the Light of Eyllwe; the woman who had been a beacon of hope – just like that, as if she were no more than a wisp of candlelight, she was gone.””But no matter what I did, Elentiya, I want you to know that in the darkness of the past ten years, you were one of the bright lights for me. Do not let that light go out.”Kaltain and Roland:”Sometimes,” Kaltain said softly, and Celaena paused. “Sometimes I think they brought me here. Not to marry Perrington, but for another purpose. They want to use me.”I still don’t know what the king plans with Kaltain and Roland but whatever it is, it can’t be good! That thing in the dungeons underneath the clock tower was so creepy and I really don’t even want to know what else is locked up there! *shudders* There’s no doubt the King of Adarlan is up to something and I’m kind of worried about Kaltain’s fate. I have no idea where and how Roland comes into play, but I get the slight feeling he’s allied with the king. I mean yeah he helped Dorian but maybe that was all show? Who knows? I’ll definitely watch those two closely from now on. ;-)""They encourage the crows to fly past here,"" Kaltain murmured, more to herself than to Celaena. ""And my headaches are worse every day. Worse and worse, and full of all those flapping wings.""The friendships & ships:Celaena & Dorian:”She deserved a loyal, brave knight who saw her for what she was and did not fear her. And he deserved someone who would look at him like that, even if the love wouldn’t be the same, even if the girl wouldn’t be her.So Dorian closed his eyes, and took another long breath. And when he opened his eyes, he let her go.”Those two!!!I know they had troubles at the beginning but the friendship that formed between them is so perfect!!! I’m so happy that they were able to settle their differences and I love Dorian for letting her go! This was such a powerful scene and I’m so glad they eventually managed to become friends again! I loved it when Dorian told Celaena that she will always have a place with him and that she could come to his dorms whenever she needed something.THATis friendship!!!THATis trust!!! Oh gosh, I really hope Sarah won’t crush this again! *lol*”Their eyes met and held. A line stretched taut between them – a moment of trust, and a promise of answers from both of them.””But looking at Dorian as he smiled at her, this prince who was smart and thoughtful and kind, who inspired good men like Chaol to serve him …Celaena wondered if Nehemia’s impossible, desperate dream of that court might yet come to pass.””Thank you for all that you have done for me, Dorian. Thank you for being my friend. For not being like the others.” He paused, turning to face her. She kept her chin high, but her eyes were gleaming.“I’ll come back,” she said quietly. “I’ll come back for you.”Dorian & Chaol:Dorian’s lips were pursed, his face stony as he quietly said, “I’ve been busy, too.” The Crown Prince turned his horse away, heading in another direction, but paused. “Chaol,” he said, looking over his shoulder. Dorian’s eyes were frozen, his jaw clenched. “Treat her well.”*sigh* Their friendship suffered so much in this book and I really wish this wouldn’t have happened. I loved that they were so close and could talk about everything, but I guess now that Celaena got into their way things between them might never be the same again. >_< It’s sad that Dorian can’t tell Chaol about his powers but I definitely understand why he’s so cautious. I mean Chaol was always so damn loyal to the king and that actually makes it more than just hard to trust him. If I’d be in Dorian’s situation, I wouldn’t tell him as well. =(”Dorian could have gleefully killed Chaol’s father for disowning him, refusing even to see Chaol when he brought his family to Rifthold for an important meeting with the king. Even though Chaol had never said it, Dorian knew the scars went deep.”Celaena & Chaol:”I know you can look after yourself. But I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn’t, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”I can’t believe Sarah used 1 ½ books to build this relationship and then decided to thoroughly sink the ship! Oh wait! I actuallyCANbelieve it! *LOL* After reading ACOTAR nothing should surprise me anymore! Still, I mean I never was the biggest fan of this ship (everyone who read my review of ToG knows that) but I at least would have wanted them to be happy for a while. And the way it happened!!I can understand that Celaena was angry at Chaol but I really didn’t get why she acted the way she did. I mean at first she’s all in love with Chaol and jumps to his rescue because he’s been kidnapped and all she wants is to save him becauseshe loves him oh so muchand then in the next moment she’s at his throat and almost kills him! Hell! She didn’t even give him a chance to explain himself! Yes, I’m aware this would have changed nothing about Nehemia’s death, but I think if she would have let him talk, she’d have realised that he didn’t know about the king’s plans. She wronged poor Chaol so much and even though he made bad decisions I still feel sorry for him. Because let’s face it, he might have never trusted Celaena but he certainly loved her deeply. T_TWhat a shipwreck!!!RIP!”She knew his every move and he knew hers, as though they’d been dancing this waltz together all their lives. Faster, never faltering, never breaking her stare.The rest of the world quieted into nothing. In that moment, after ten long years, Celaena looked at Chaol and realized she was home.””It had snuck up on him, this pain and terror and rage at the thought of anyone else with her. Every look, every word from her … He didn’t even know when it had started.””But he didn’t know how to get her in line. He didn’t know how to fix what had been broken. Both inside her, and between them.”All told I really loved“Crown of Midnight”and I can’t wait to dive into“Heir of Fire.”Since this was another buddy read with myprecious GemI actually enjoyed the experience even more! XD I loved our discussions about the plot and characters and the fact Gem is such a hardcore Chaol fan only addedfire to the fuelto the fun. *lol*Let’s pick up book 3 soon!!! I promise I won’t talk bad about Chaol! Well, I’ll try not to! Scout’s honor! ;-P",5
1220,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","This is how you write a fantasy novel. Great characters, development, evolution, and revelations. Magic used intelligently, and my personal favourite action. I could not put the book down. I like the way that they characters have their responsibilities and jobs, but that is not all that defines them. Celaena has no problem hacking up body parts, but she is still a girl who loves to shop. I think even though she is an assassin, she sees herself as more of an avenger. She will avenge her friends no matter the cost.The story Celaena Sardothien won the right to become the King's Champion (personal Assassin) since then, she has been charged with dispatching a number of his enemies. In many cases, she brings back trophies in the form of severed heads and family insignias (rings) still attached to the hands. However, having no love for the King she has been, she has been helping his enemies get away and fake their deaths. The problem is she is too good at it, and even her closest friends and biggest supporters believe she has completely turned over to the dark side. Then she is given a target who intersected with her former life in Assassins Keep (Archer), a courtesan (prostitute). This simple assignment sends a ripple effect affecting Celaena and everyone she cares about. They also fill in some history; there is a more detailed account of what Celaena did the day she ""snapped"" in Endovier. There are also hints that Celaena knows exactly who betrayed her. In the next book I am begging for a showdown with the King of Assassins, but so far Celaena has already made enough enemies to keep her busy for a good long time, which is great news for a long series. The only thing I did find annoying in this book is the right characters suddenly appearing exactly the right moment, but will all the fate and prophecies in the book, this could be easily explained.I am a fan of Sarah's writing style, having chapters of different lengths, and almost chunking the chapters so information is easy to take in and break up for me. This might be a fairy tale setting but that is where the similarities stop, this is more the grim story tales type of book, with grizzly deaths, torcher, and harsh language (even though the characters do not swear in print, they usually ""unleash a string of curse""). I love the Throne of Glass universe. There are references made to not only the first novel but the eBook prequels as well.This book is a lot more action packed to the first novel, there HUGE revelations about Celaena and Dorian, (who have a Luke and Leia type relationship), as well as the forces that are using them. It's a great book. Start it, and you will not be able to put it down. You do not need to have read the previous stories to enjoy this one, but they do help, and after reading this one, you will want to go back and read the others.",5
1221,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","upon reread, ive decided to bump up my rating. knowing how the story plays out over the span of 7 books, its allowed me to view this with a different perspective. when i first read this, i didnt like how much page-time is focused on boring history, but now i can really appreciate all of the top-notch foreshadowing thats going on.everything else in my original review still applies.___________________________firstly, wow! i think this might be better than the first book! and i actually really liked'throne of glass,'so thats saying something!secondly, i saw a status update the other day where someone expressed their frustration with how women in novels, specifically YA, are too often portrayed as fierce and dangerous. while i agree that kindness and gentleness should also be represented, i have to say that ilivefor my ruthless and downright deadly ladies.for me, reading about celaena, about an assassin, is insight into a world i would never experience in a million years. i dont have a violent bone in my body. i actually think my body is programmed with a ‘flight and flight’ response. so i love being able to experience what its like for someone to have so much conviction that she would literally kill for what she believed in. that is the beauty of books, my friends.so give me a merciless assassin any day of the week. you go, girl! see ya in book #3!↠4.5 stars",5
1222,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","4.5 starsHear ye, hear ye all who seek adventure, ass-kicking and romance come forth! The second installment doth not disappoint! Our heroine is back as the King's Champion so expect action galore. Hear ye, hear ye . . .Her lovely dresses and ornate clothes were gone, replaced with an unforgiving, close-cut black tunic and pants. Her hair pulled back in a long braid that fell into the folds of that dark cloak she was always wearing. She was a beautiful wrath …This book turned up in my room dressed in dark robes, whispered the first few sentences like a secret incantation and before I could utter'By the Wyrd'I was under its spell (not saying that this book has magical powers, but this book has magical powers . . . in fact I'm pretty sure Sarah J. Maas is Fae). It swept me down a path of ink and words, and every time I thought it had given me its all,'surely it can't get better than this . . . surely,'it would open its robes to unveil yet more wondrous things.Then it took a boot to my love for female assassins and pushed hard and now I'm sitting at the bottom of a canyon singing to myself:O' hither she came ,and stole my heart,henceforth I shall never be the same,your jewels to her you will part,or so is the King's claim,a jewelley thief? O' she played it smart,she is of much greater fame,your body she will cart,this deadly daggered dame,your name you will never part,before she takes her aim.(You're writing it love poetry? Really Mara, REALLY?)Characters:I've already made my adoration towardsCelaenaquite clear so I'd like to take a moment to appreciate our two leading men: Chaol (still firmly Team Shirtless Chaol) and Dorian (and I wouldn't mind seeing him shirtless too).Chaol, Chaol, wherefore art thou Chaol? I am, as we speak, arranging to become a fictional character so I canstalkmeet you.The Captain of the Guard is as strong and fierce as he was in ToG but in this installment we get to see more of his softer side. The beautiful friendship between Celaena and him takes front stage in CoM. Sarah really takes the opportunity to flesh out their relationship in all it's banter-teasing-tension glory. There's talk of books(sigh)and late nights spent next to the fireplace.While Chaol's compassion and loyalty are beacons of light in the darkness of the Royal Court, the question is where exactly do his loyalties lie? With the Crown he has fought so hard to protect? Or with his friends who have made the glass castle a home for him?""Why are you crying?""""Because,"" she whispered, her voice shaking, ""you remind me of how the world ought to be. What the worldcanbe.""Then there isDorianour charming prince. But again Sarah sucker punches stereotypes and leaves them panting for breath on the floor. Dorian isn't your garden variety indestructible, white horse riding, fierce, saves-the-day prince. Instead he can be fragile and confused and he is made all the more strong for it. Shocking isn't it that boys can experience the same emotions as female heroines(cough)? Sarah doesn't kick him to the curb either. Rather another layer of mystery is added when strange things start happening to him . . . things that put his life at risk.The most refreshing aspect of this trio's relationship is that Celaena is not turned into a Mary Sue mess in the face of these male ""interests."" Four for you Sarah J. Maas.I am not at all done with these characters and I'm ready for their next adventure. CoM had it all:magic, adventure, epic fights, romance, mysteryandsecrets. . . so many dirty little secrets that aren't as neatly tucked into the nooks and crannies of the Royal Court as their owners would like to think. The ending left me as hungry for more as when I started.This series is going to go wondrous places in the next instalment and I can barely wait._____________________________PRE-REVIEW: 30/09/2012:2013?! No no no no no. Why are you so far away?!2013 is finally here!I just can't. Okay? I need me some more Dorian and Chaol. Pweeeeaaaaase?Be strong my shipper heart.

She'd been called Adarlan's assassin for a reason. Dramatic entrances were practically her art form.""—and this—""Curled on the couch beside Chaol, Calaena took a sip of her tea and frowned. ""Can't you hire a servant like Philippa, so we can have someone bring us treats?""—possibly be the same person?I teetered between liking and hating Calaena while reading. Mostly hating. I can handle the shoes and shopping because a girl has the right to look damn good while disemboweling enemies. (Fun fact: Calaena finally acts like a real assassin in this installment)But leaving her post todance?I'm going to say it one more time to let it sink in. The world'sgreatest assassinleft. Her. Fucking. Post. To. Dance.It's such a transparent attempt to squeeze in a moonlit waltz between Chaol and Calaena, I want to laugh.I'm Team Dorian, by the way. Just putting that out there. Chaol is an overprotective fucknuckle who can suck it.Calaena still does stupid crap, like exploring without backup or sufficient research. Her obsession with chocolate cake is goddamn annoying. It's too cutesy and feels like Maas's trying too hard. Each time it came up, I felt like paraphrasing Amy fromGone Girl: No one fucking likes chocolate cake that much.Midway, as I was finally warming up to Calaena, she turns into an uber Mary Sue.She's part Fae, the lost queen of Terrasen, and has magical powers. For fuck's sake. Choose one, Maas. Don't be greedy.I originally warmed up to Calaena because of Maas's excellent portrayal of loss and depression. It's not resolved in a chapter or two; it's an underlining theme that affects the latter half of the book. I especially like thatCalaena doesn't forgive Chaol right away. Nehemia dying wasn't his fault, but her anger and distrust is justified.I also liked Dorian'smagicsubplot. It's one of the few things in Crown of Midnight that made me sit up, and partially why I think he'd be good with Calaena: ice and fire.He's a way better love interestandfriend. I don't care if it's planet-aligning true love, you don't sneak around with your best friend's ex-girlfriend. *cough*Chaol*cough* I especially like the part where Dorian sees them dancing and chooses to let her go. It was a sweet, poignant moment. And put me firmly on his side, even though I'm destined to lose.Ah, well.A Court of Thorns and Rosesis amazing and I will definitely check out anything else Maas writes, but this series is a disappointing mess.My review of Throne of GlassMy review of Heir of FireMy review of Queen of Shadows",2
1225,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","Esto es una maravilla.Hacía mucho tiempo que un libro no me ""llenaba"" de esta forma. El estilo de Sarah J Maas no es el más complejo del mundo, pero tampoco es una lectura sencilla y ligera. Sin embargo,consigue que me trague hasta el más mínimo punto para descubrir cada detalle(exceptuando cómo se viste Celaena, que me da un poco igual).La manera en la que Maas consigue sumergirte en la historia es espectacular, incluso con personajes que te puedan caer mal. Simplemente estás enganchado y quieres saber más y más.Vamos viendo en esta segunda parte de la serieTrono de Cristalcómorealmente hemos estado un poco engañadxs.A ver, yo sabía que había más... cosas, pero la forma en la que la historia va evolucionando está muy bien hecha. Sí, comenzamos con una esclava/asesina profesional y su propia venganza para el rey que acabó con la vida de tantos inocentes. Y sí, ella es despiadada y tiene un plan, y sabe sabotear al monarca.Pero tenemos siempre como ruido de fondo la magia, la extinción de esta, las Marcas de Wyrd, tierras lejanas que amenazan con rebelarse... Y ese ruido de fondo poco a poco va ganando fuerza.¿Esto es una historia sobre las clases sociales en un mundo de alta fantasía o... es otra cosa?EnCorona de medianocheveremos cómo las tornas cambian,y que el tema simplista de ser asesina se va entremezclando con otras cosas mucho más interesantes, profundas y mágicas. Es una muy buena transición, aunque sé que vendrán cosas más increíbles.Esta saga tiene algo que engancha mucho, y es que la protagonista nada entre dos aguas.A veces, no son tan claras, pero en otras ocasiones sí.Dorian. Chaol. Son dos caras de la misma moneda, ¿o no?Yo como lector no dejaba de preguntarme qué pasaba por sus cabezas, y aunque a veces tenemos una breve mirada hacia ellas, me siguen pareciendo enigmáticos y misteriosos. Y honestamente, es difícil decidirse.No me cae mal ninguno de ellos(incluso hablando de traiciones, como en este libro), porque siento que son personajes demasiado atados a sus actuales condiciones de vida, actuando lo mejor que pueden dentro de un marco opresivo que les ahoga. ¿Cuál es la decisión correcta en un mundo corrupto de por sí?Me gusta muchísimo cómo se plantean sus conflictos morales y personales para con Celaena o el reino de Adarlan.Como ya he comentado,el estilo de Sarah es cautivador. Engancha muchísimo, pese a no ser una lectura sencilla.Ni las palabras, ni la forma de narrar son algo propio de una novela pensada para ser adictiva y ya está. Tiene un componente muy literario, de profundidad, de lentitud, pero nunca deja de contar cosas. Todo lo que narra sirve para algo, incluso la mínima tontería que menciona de refilón.La forma en la que el misterio es planteado en torno a Elena, su Ojo y las Marcas de Wyrd me ha dejado con el culo torcido.Es un constante ""creo que va a ir por aquí"", pero termina yendo en la dirección opuesta, y luego te sorprende aún más, y sigues descubriendo más y más cosas que no te esperas. Honestamente, unas cartas muy bien jugadas.No entiendo, por cierto, el odio que algunas personas le tienen a Celaena Sardothien. ¡NO LO ENTIENDO!Me parece uno de los personajes más complejos de la literatura juvenil actual. Y es que no solo es compleja, sino bien construida, y además -que es lo más importante- no es buena. Tiene su parte mala, vengativa, llena de malicia. Que lo use para lo que tú consideres el bien o el mal es otra cosa, pero sus decisiones se basan en, sí, por qué no, momentos calientes o llenos de rabia. Y no hay nada malo en ello: es una maldita asesina.Me parece que tiene una personalidad clara y perfectamente dibujada. Es inteligente y llena de poder para engañar, que es un soplo de aire fresco entre tanto personaje heroico o 'bueno'.Corona de medianochenos habla más y mejor de la historia de este universo. EnTrono de Cristalteníamos una buena introducción a ello, pero aquí, descubriendo más sobre el pasado y la magia que habitaba este continente, observamos que hay mucho más que contar y descubrir.Que si el Reino de las Brujas, el circo con Piernas Amarillas, los dioses antiguos, llaves mágicas... Es como que vamos viendo poco a poco un poquito más, y ese poquito expande muchísimo el universo planteado en el primer libro.Lo que más me fascina de todo, es que cuadra y encaja perfectamente con lo contado desde el primer momento. Todo tiene el más absoluto sentido, y se nota hacia dónde irá a parar la autora. No puedo estar más emocionado.Para mí ha sido una de las mejores lecturas del año,y aunque he tenido malos momentos con este libro (yeah,un paroncito lector o pasajes que me aburrían hasta comprender por qué eran necesarios), sin duda lo guardaré con muy buen recuerdo por haberme arrancado esa ilusión de mi yo lector de doce años con libros de fantasía.Necesito más, quiero más.Así que seguiré ya mismo conHeredera de fuegopara saciar mi sed. Dios, demasiadas cosas van a pasar...y no sé si estoy preparado.",5

1229,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","""I was expecting more doom and gloom.""This is the book that made me hopeful about this series. I have to confess, even with the popular opinion being the series getting better with each book, I had my doubts. I couldn't imagine the author breaking away from her original portrayer of Celaena considerably. So, though she was more or less the same, it came as a pleasant surprise, to see she is now sharing the story with two other POVs. Though the Crown of Midnight was not a huge improvement, this is certainly a step in right direction.""Some of the things you hear with your ears. Others, you hear with your heart.""Aside from having multiple POVs, there isn't a whole lot different about this book: writing style, world building, characters, are nearly identical to the first, and moves along the same plot. And the first half did make me think this second book was not improved at all compared to the first. But then, right around the halfway point, an incident completely changed things, which led to a highly eventful, and entertaining second half. All the characters went through some dramatic changes after this point, and finally brought down some of Celaena's conflicting (and annoying) character traits. I also appreciate the use of multiple POVs. I know this would probably change in future, but in this second book, I think Dorian was my favorite character. But after how the author changes the characters' actions spontaneously(like Chaol's), I wouldn't be surprised to see that change in future books.""You'd be surprised how easily men see what they want to see.""The underlying plot of the story is still not clear, even by the end of this second book. But considering there are seven book in this series, I guess it would be this way, at least until the fourth or fifth book. Hopefully, the plotlines would be streamlined soon enough, so that the final books will not have a lot of loose ends. Overall, I liked the second book more than the first, and for me, it earned a complete star (from 2.5-stars to 3.5), and I'm hoping to see the growth consistent.""You must learn to ask the right questions before you can receive right answers.""",3

1232,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestEdit: I am bumping this up to a three because it is the best book in the series.I don't think I've read a book that was so mystifyingly over-hyped sinceFIFTY SHADES OF GREY. Every time one of these books comes out, my feed is immediately saturated with them forweeks. I realize that in reading these books, I am contributing to the problem, but I never said I wasn't a hypocrite. (Actually I probably did, but then again, how very hypocritical of me.) I read the first book about three years ago, and did not like it, but morbid curiosity inspired me to do a brutally honest reread ofTHRONES OF GLASS. The feedback was surprisingly positive (although I did lose a friend or two along the way, and even had some people block me). No hard feelings, though. You know what they say - those in glass castles shouldn't cast stones. Orsomething.***WARNING: BIG SPOILERS AND SNARK AHEAD***CROWN OF MIDNIGHT is book two in the chronicles of Celiac. I mean, Cellophane. I mean, Celery. Yes, let's stick with Celery. It's much easier to say than Celeana. In the last book, Celery partook in a Hunger Games-like competition to be the King's Champion for the hit new reality series in Adarlan, ""Keeping Up with the Sardothiens."" Everyone watched, agog, as a tiny, skinny girl inexplicably kicked the butts of men twice her size and strength, including me. It's almost like she hadn't been malnourished and imprisoned for years. Muscle atrophy, like smelly farts, bad hair days, and actually having toworkat stuff, is something that just doesn't happen to Celery, Queen of the Mary Sues.Unlike the rest of us pathetic mortals. *eye roll*In this book, Celery is the King's Champion, and the obviously corrupt king is having her kill his dissenters. Only sucks for him, because Celery is totes Scarlet Pimperneling him, faking their deaths and mercifully allowing them to escape instead while bringing back the severed heads of scavenged corpses. (It's almost like sheisn'tgood at her job as an assassin or something.) ((Also, girl, what's up with the weird severed head fetish? It's like my girl Celery thinks that they're Pokemon cards and she's gotta trade and collect 'em all.)) At the same time, she's trying to decipher the secrets of the Wyrdmarks, with the help of Nehemia, AKA Queen Bae.Nehemia was the best thing about book one and also the best thing about book two, and she and Celery had way more chemistry than Celery did with either Kale (because he's overrated, like the vegetable kale, and often appears when not wanted) or Durian (should be obvious, but because he stinks. Like durian). So what does Maas decide to do to Nehemia?Kill her off, obviously.I'd been warned about this beforehand - because people have no self-control when it comes to spoilers in this series, it's like GAME OF THRONES (guess how I learned about the Red Wedding?) - but it still totally caught me off-guard and made me angry. To understand why this plot twist made people so angry, it's because it's totally an example of theMagical Negrotrope. Fans argue that Nehemia's death was important, because it was the catalyst to Celery finding out The Truth -but that is literally the exact definition of the ""Magical Negro"" trope. To quote the wonderful TV Tropes wiki: ""[they] have no goal in life other than helping white people achieve their fullest potential;he may even be ditched or killed outright once he's served that purpose"" (emphasis mine).And here's what Nehemia says about her fate when Celeryraises her from the deadto ask her for secrets and also lamely apologize:""I knew what my fate was to be, and I embraced it. I ran toward it. Because it was the only way for things to begin changing, for events to be set in motion""(290).YOU SEE. YOU SEE THAT.RIP, Nehemia. Cause of death: lazy writing.After that, Celery sulks over Nehemia's death while also seeking vengeance, blames Kale, runs back to Durian, and stalks the Finnick O'dair knockoff, Archer, because of his possible involvement with the rise of the lost Terrasen queen, Attlestar Galactica (or, you know, whatever). Turns out Kaledidn't meanto kill Nehemia and she blamed him mostly falsely, but that's okay because he's a saint. Turns out Durian has magic and so does his evol father, but that's okay, because Durian's a saint. Turns out Finnick O'dair was the bad guy, but that's okay, because Celery still hastwo other love interest to ping-pong between, so screw him, he's no saint. Oh, but the bestest part of all is the grand reveal:CELERY IS THEPART-FAE DESCENDANT OF AN ACTUAL GODDESS AND THE LONG-LOST QUEEN. It's like, you thought your girl Celery was a Mary Sue in the last book with her ""I'm so beautiful, don't hate me because I'm amazing"" ""I can kick butt and you'll never see me break a nail doing it, but let me list out my murders like I'm a DnDer listing out my character's statz"" -hold the phone and let's take these Mary Sue levels from 1 to ""This is my Original Character from my Crossover fic about TWILIGHT AND HARRY POTTER.""She even has magical eyes that areblue ringed with goldand we get this line that actually made me laugh out loud, because it totally sounds like something someone writing a crossover fic about TWILIGHT and HARRY POTTER would say:""I somehow inherited the ability to shift. Between my Fae form and my human form""(312).I'm also super confused. Did she know who she was all along? Lose her memory? I feel like this wasn't really foreshadowed that well at all in the first book. You'd think that if a reveal like that was planned, there'd be more hints so readers wouldn't be all, ""holy literal deus ex machina, Batman!""So, apart from... THAT... how was the book? The writing was significantly better. If the first book was a one-star review that had been bumped up to a 2, this book was a three-star review that had been bumped down to a two. The action sequences were better, the writing was tighter, there were fewer moments where I wanted to hit the EJECT button that would catapult Celery from the narrative so I would never have to lay eyes on her smug little face ever again. There's still a lot that's really frustrating, though, and I think the biggesttechnicalproblem of this story is that rather than the characters driving the story,the story drives the characters. Their characterization is inconsistent, especially Celery's, and they will fluctuate between very different personalities whenever it's convenient for the plot. Add to that the fact that Celery's ""abilities"" are constantly getting stacked on top of each other, like a very special game of Mary Sue Jenga, and that shtick gets old, fast.I'll be continuing this project with HEIR OF FIRE, so stay tuned for more updates!2 to 2.5 stars",3

En este libro, Celaena camina por una delgada línea y se arriesga con cada movimiento que hace, ya no sólo con sus acciones en contra del Rey, sino con respecto a sus sentimientos. A medida que pasan las páginas, Celaena demuestra más que nunca por qué es la mejor asesina del reino y, además, lo difícil que le es confiar en alguien después de todo lo que vivió con Sam y la flagrante traición de laAssassin's Guild.Aquí, también, conocemos a Archer, uno de los objetivos del Rey y, por ende, una de las personas a las que Celaena debe matar. Pero Archer es mucho más que un chico rico y bien posicionado, y junto con él, descubriremos que en Rifthold se cuecen mucho más que pequeñas insurrecciones contra el Rey, pues la semilla de una gran revolución está creciendo allí.Crown of Midnightes el libro con el que empezamos a entender la dimensión tan grande que tuvo la erradicación de la magia, la matanza de casas reales y la conquista de quien ahora es el Rey de todo el Imperio, el tirano. Poco a poco, nos dan pequeños detalles sobre diferentes tierras, diferentes reinos y, sobre todo, de la historia de Terrasen y quienes fueran los miembros de la familia real. ¡Y es que todo empieza a unirse! La gran revolución, los miembros perdidos de la familia real de Terrasen, el papel de Nehemia en las conspiraciones... todo va cayendo en su lugar.Poco más puedo decir sin caer enspoilers, pero lo que sí mencionaré es que mi corazón fue muy feliz durante aproximadamente 70 páginas... y luego Sarah J. Maas lo destrozó sin piedad. Si hay algo que tienen los libros de esta mujer son emociones extremas, la capacidad de hacer que te enamores de todos los personajes, de que confíes en ellos y de que luego, por supuesto, no veas venir la puñalada que siempre estuvo preparada a tu espalda. Yo ahí lo voy a dejar.Ahora, si me lo permiten, voy a hacer una gran sección despoilersporque necesito sacar todo esto o voy a terminar en el psicólogo.♣♣♣⋆Una de las primeras escenas, que es cuando Celaena llega a la sala donde están reunidos todos, el Rey incluido, y le lleva la prueba de que mató a sus últimos encargos es escalofriante. La cabeza y la mano cercenadas... vaya. Y las reacciones de Chaol y Dorian al ver lo desapegada que puede ser la chica a la que aman. Es todos súper fuerte.⋆¿Podemos hablar de Mort, el picaporte parlanchín? ¡Lo amoooooo! Nunca pensé que llegara a amar tanto a un picaporte, jajajajaja. ¡Y es tan sarcástico! Adoro las conversaciones que tienen él y Celaena, sobre todo porque ella tiene poquísima paciencia y él es tremendamente misterioso. Es un vestigio de la magia de antaño y, por eso mismo, tiene muchas respuestas.⋆Archer, maldito Archer. Es de esos personajes que sabes desde el principio que van a traer problemas, que esconden un montón de cosas detrás de sonrisas y actitud ingenua. ¡Maldita sea! Odié durante todo el libro ver, de nuevo, cómo Celaena iba caminando directa hacia una trampa, hacia otra traición más.⋆¿Soy la única que no podía con losfeelscuando Dorian y Chaol hablaban sobre Celaena? Son taaaaaan tontitos. Y me gusta mucho ver a Dorian en plan ""sí, venga, ya la he superado"", pero aún así la observa desde lejos y siente un pequeño rayo de envidia cada que ve a Chaol y a Celaena entrenando. Y, madre mía, es que Chaol es demasiado envarado en un principio para su propio bien. Cuando la mitad del libro se lo pasa pensando que no debe cruzar una línea invisible que lo separa de Celaena es como ""¡POR FAVOR HAZLO YA QUE ELLA TAMBIÉN TE QUIERE!"".⋆Cuando mencionan a Aelin Galathynius por primera vez en el libro y quedas en plan de OMG.⋆¿Podemos hablar de ese momento en el que Chaol explota y le dice a Celaena que SIEMPRE le va a preocupar lo que pase con ella?*inserte grito fangirl aquí*⋆DIOSES DEL OLIM--- No, esperen. ¡POR EL WYRD! Hablemos de esa noche en la que Celaena salió a una misión, la hieren con una daga envenenada y por poquísimo logra llegar al Castillo y cae justo en los brazos de Chaol antes de desmayarse. ¡Lo pasé muy mal! Por momentos creí que no llegaría. Y luego cuando se despierta y ve que Chaol está dormido en la silla al lado de su cama. Morí de amor.⋆Como si mi amor por Chaol no fuera ya enorme, está el momento en el que ambos están montando guardia en un baile real y Celaena se aburre y empieza a bailar sola. Y luego él la invita a bailar. Y son absolutamente preciosos. ¡Y Dorian los ve por la ventana! Ay, los amo.⋆OMG, hablemos de la pequeña conversación que tienen Nehemia y Dorian en la que ella le dice que él tiene un gran poder escondido. ¡Y luego resulta que es así! Dorian tiene magia. Repito: DORIAN, el hijo del Rey que desterró la magia, TIENE MAGIA. Es tremendo ver cómo a lo largo del libro Dorian intenta comprender de dónde sale, por qué ��l la tiene y cómo demonios la controla, pues si alguien en el Castillo se da cuenta, estará muerto en cuestión de horas.⋆Baba Yellowlegs. ¡Vaya arpía! Dioses, la odié tantísimo desde el primer momento en el que la vi. Primero con Dorian, cuando descubre todos sus secretos, y luego en la escena letal con Celaena. Creo que es de las peleas más angustiantes que he leído en algún libro. Esa vieja anciana es tan poderosa y retorcida que de verdad temí por la vida de Celaena. ¡Madre mía, qué batalla! Pero me alegró un montón que Celaena la matara al final, aunque tengo la sensación de que ese asesinato le traerá consecuencias muy feas en los próximos libros.⋆Hay un momento en el que Celaena se va del Palacio justo antes del amanecer. El día en el que se cumplen diez años de la masacre de sus padres... El día en el que también se cumple un año desde que desató su ira en los campos de Endovier. Leer esa escena, eseflashbacky ver lo poco que le importaba la vida y la frialdad que recorría sus venas es escalofriante. Esta es, creo, la primera escena en la que realmente conocemos a Celaena por su reputación, por su nombre de la Asesina de Adarlan. Un arma letal en estado puro.⋆¿Qué tal el momento en el que Celaena le confiesa a Chaol que no ha matado a ninguno de los objetivos del Rey? ¡Y el pánico que él siente! ESO ES AMOR, señoras y señores. Y luego ella le dice que si alguien se entera, ella huirá... ¡Y él le dice que se iría con ella! ¡Y LUEGO SE BESAN! ¡POR FIN! ¡UN LIBRO Y MEDIO ESPERANDO ESTE BESO! Creo que, literalmente, grité un poco cuando leí esa escena porque LOSFEELS, asdjkaslkhdkasjd. ¡Y ES QUE NO SÓLO SE BESAN SINO QUE HACEN EL AMOR Y ES LA PRIMERA VEZ DE CELAENA Y ES CON CHAOL Y TODO ES PERFECTO EN EL MUNDO!⋆Hablemos del hermoso regalo de cumpleaños de Celaena a Chaol. La cena más romántica de la vida en un ático lleno de lucecitas. Son lo más tierno de la vida.⋆Y cuando las personas a las que Celaena había estado siguiendo para conseguir información sobre el movimiento rebelde en Rifthold secuestran a Chaol es cuando todo se empieza a ir a la mierda. Obviamente ella se vuelve loca, llega al lugar en donde lo tienen, se da cuenta de que todo ha sido una treta de Archer y mata a un montón de personas antes de que la hagan entrar en razón. Finalmente dejan ir a Chaol, pero no sin antes decirle a Celaena que Chaol sabía de una amenaza a la vida de Nehemia pero no le había dicho nada... Y Archer revela que el plan de matar a Nehemia está programado para esa noche. Celaena monta en cólera y se va corriendo hacia el Palacio con Chaol detrás, pero llegan muy tarde y Nehemia está muerta en su cama.⋆La rabia se apodera de Celaena, quien solo puede culpar a Chaol de haber sabido la información y no habérsela dado a tiempo para proteger a su amiga. Así que se vuelve contra él y lo ataca sin un rastro de humanidad en ella. Está a punto de matarlo. Dioses, nunca leí algo tan terrible. El odio que emanaba de esas páginas, de Celaena, era horrible. Y lo que le dice de que nunca jamás volverá a ser su amiga y que siempre será su enemigo me partió el corazón. En mil pedacitos. Adiós, Chaolaena.⋆Celaena en la mazmorra. Celaena en su cuarto. Celaena zombie.⋆Después de su periodo de duelo, entra su periodo de ira. Y Celaena empieza a rastrear quién fue el culpable de la muerte de Nehemia. Y se da cuenta de que un Ministro, el que patrocinaba a Grave en el concurso del Rey, fue quien dio la orden, así que la Asesina de Adarlan sale a las calles de Rifthold a buscar su venganza. Y vaya que sí la obtiene. La muerte de Grave es una de las más sangrientas de estos libros. Y el momento en el que Celaena le lleva la cabeza de Grave al Ministro en plena reunión y con el Rey ahí... épico.⋆Ese momento en el que Celaena se va a la tumba de Nehemia y canta una canción en un idioma extraño. Y Chaol la escucha. ¡Y empieza a investigar y a tener sus teorías sobre el pasado de Celaena! Poco a poco va llegando a que puede ser de una de las familias reales que el Rey masacró cuando desterró todo atisbo de magia.⋆Todo eso de lasWyrdkeys, de su poder y de que el Rey puede tener una o dos es escalofriante.⋆¿Qué tal las mazmorras que encuentra Celaena justo debajo de la Torre del Reloj? ¡Y la criatura con la que se encuentra ahí! Joder, este fue otro de los momentos en los que pensé que Celaena iba a quedar seriamente herida. ¡Y encima con Dorian detrás de ella! Esas páginas son absolutamente escalofriantes. Pero son una gran escena porque finalmente los dos logran sellar una puerta y contener a la criatura... y ahí es cuando Celaena ve por primera vez a Dorian usar su magia.⋆Durante todo el libro, hay momentos en los que hablan de laFerian Gapy de que oyen aleteos al otro lado. Y yo lo único que puedo pensar en esas páginas es: OMG,ILLYRIAN WARRIORS, RHYYYYYYYYYYYYS!⋆Oh,gods... Y aquí llegamos a la parte del libro en la que Celaena la embarra muy mal. Se le ocurre abrir un portal al mundo de los muertos para hablar con Nehemia una última vez, pero todo sale fatal y termina apareciendo un espectro horroroso. Chaol y Dorian aparecen y también están en peligro. Cuando Chaol llega ve que Fleetfoot, la perrita de Celaena, está herida y justo cuando la va a salvar, el monstruo se la lleva al otro lado del portal. Y Celaena, que está en muy mal estado y casi ni se puede levantar, VE CÓMO CHAOL ATRAVIESA EL PORTAL Y ES COMO ""WTF, POR QUÉ HACES ESO"". ¡Y luego ella cruza! ¡Y CUANDO CRUZA EL PORTAL ENTRAN A UN MUNDO DONDE TODAVÍA HAY MAGIA Y CELAENA SE TRANSFORMA Y REVELA SUS FACCIONES DEFAEY TODO ES MUY FUERTE, PUES SALVA A CHAOL A SU PERRITA, SALE DE AHÍ Y SELLAN EL PORTAL.⋆Lo único bueno de esta experiencia tan traumática, reveladora y llena deshockes que Celaena descubre que no fue el Ministro quien ordenó asesinar a Nehemia, sino el mismísimo Archer, rata asquerosa del demonio. Así que, obviamente, nuestra asesina favorita va a por su venganza. Y vaya sí es dulce. No se imaginan lo que disfruté leyendo cómo mataba al desgraciado bastardo traicionero.⋆¿Podemos hablar del momento en el que, después de mil quinientos años, Celaena y Chaol vuelven a hablar como personas civilizadas y ella le pregunta cómo puede verla si ya sabe lo que es? ¡Y ÉL ESTÁ A PUNTO DE DECIRLE QUE ES PORQUE LA AMA! ¡Y, JODER, ELLA NO LO DEJA TERMINAR LA FRASE! Y mi corazón duele porque quiero que Chaolaena sea real, pero en el fondo sé que ya nunca sucederá.⋆Y encima Chaol tiene la brillante idea de crear un plan con su padre para que envíen a Celaena, como Campeona del Rey, a asesinar a la familia real de Wendlyn... Pero lo que Chaol quiere en realidad es protegerla y alejarla del Rey ahora que sabe que es Fae. Y comete un gran error, porque el lugar de Celaena debería estar en Rifthold averiguando lo de las Wyrdkeys. ¡Pero a la vez es como OMG, la están enviando a donde la línea con losfaees aún más delgada y en donde puede contactar con las personas que harán de la revolución algo real!⋆MORÍ EN EL MOMENTO EN EL QUE CHAOL DESCUBRE QUE CELAENA ES LA HEREDERA PERDIDA DE TERRASEN, LA QUE VA A PODER RECLAMAR EL TRONO... ¡QUE ELLA ES AELIN ASHRYVER GALATHYNIUS!DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN.",5
1234,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","edit jan 22, 2022: um. this was so fucking boring? i mean i guess i kind of agree with my initial rating that this wasn't the worst and at least celaena now has the motivation to help someone other than herself but god the journey to get there was paved with boredom and needless sacrifice of fun side characters.also why did she give chaol that good wap??? of all of the men in this damn book series...-------------------------------------------Okay Sarah, you sly bitch*. This didn't completely suck.This is a hard book to review because I don't really want to go into the plot (too complicated) or the characters (not a ton of development) in depth. What I can say though is that once a major plot point happened about 50-60% through the book, thingsREALLYchanged.The book turned from a really slow book, with neither character development nor fast plot, to a book that kind of had both! Now it wasn't crazy character development, I think that'll really happen next book. But Celaena showed hints of being less self absorbed and odious!!! And the plot kept me interested, just like it needed to.That being said, it wasn't enough to redeem this book as a 5 star read for me. Celaena still kind of sucked and I was really turned off by the love triangle. Chaol and Dorian: still VERY boring. Where is this imperfect yet sexy soulmate that I know is coming (both from spoilers & knowing Maas)???But whatever, I'm remaining patient. 3 I-wanted-to-love-you-but-still-not-quite-perfect stars.*You're not actually a bitch, I kind of love you.",3

1236,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","#0.1-#0.5The Assassin’s Blade★★★★★#1Throne of Glass★★★★★#2Crown of Midnight★★★★★#3Heir of Fire★★★★★#4Queen of Shadows★★★★★#5Empire of Storms★★★★★#6Tower of Dawn★★★★★re-read update: March 2023THAT ENDING, THOUGH.———original review: June 2018I’ve got this schedule going where I’m trying to read one book in this series per month, leading up to theKingdom of Ashrelease, so that I’m all caught up in time for the big finale, but this one took me a little while to pick it up because I had ahorribleslump in May. I went a week without touching a book, which hasn’t happened to me in years, and—no exaggeration—this was the only book that was able to cut through the slump for me.“I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn't, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”I knew a lot of people had told meCrown of Midnightwas a big turning point in the series—for better or for worse, though most people I spoke to told me this was one of their favorites—so I went into it unsure of what to expect, and thinking I’d just be content if I liked it equally as much asThrone of Glass. This book totally knocked out all of my uncertainty, though; it was fast-paced, full of plot twists and turns that, while not entirely unpredictable, were endlessly fun to watch unravel.But death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend these long, long years.While Celaena wasn’t terribly lovable in book 1, I truly enjoyed her character in this installment. It felt like I was back with the assassin from the novellas, who was someone I could genuinely enjoy and appreciate as a character. I won’t harp on again about the polarizing opinions her character draws out of readers, but I’ll stand by what I said in my TOG review: I think Celaena deserves a lot more credit than she typically receives.The rest of the world quieted into nothing. In that moment, after ten long years, Celaena looked at Chaol and realised she was home.Of course, the biggest aspect of this book isn’t Celaena’s work as an assassin, and honestly, I don’t even think it’s the political intrigue or the obstacles she faces with the whole saving-the-world-from-an-evil-king business—it’s romance, as any Sarah J. Maas reader would expect it to be. Knowing how further installments in the series pan out probably biased my views a little bit regarding the relationship in this one, but without spoiling anything, I’ll just say that I genuinely enjoyed Chaol’s character, and while he does some really stupid shit, I didn’t feel like his punishments suited the crime.She smiled sadly. “You'll figure it out. And when you do...” She shook her head, knowing she shouldn't say it, but doing it anyway. “When you do, I want you to remember that it wouldn't have made any difference to me. It's never made any difference to me when it came to you. I’d still pick you. I’ll always pick you.”There’s just one thing Ididn’tlike, and I’ll word this vaguely for anyone who hasn’t read it, but if youhaveread it, you’ll know what I mean: there’s a certain character in this series who made a “sacrifice” of themselves that was in terribly poor taste, and frankly,MADE NO SENSE.I almost knocked a star off just for this one thing. (Feel free to hit me up for private rants. I have a lot of feelings.)To escape death, she'd become death.Overall, though,Crown of Midnightwas a huge success for me. Maybe I’m buttering it up a little bit because it kicked my slump’s ass, but I’m so glad I continued the series and now I’m super excited to move on to book 3!",5
1237,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)","This book was just pure fun and excitement; it is not without a lot of flaws, but overall, my enjoyment of the plot propelled it into a highly satisfying read. I have to swallow my words when it comes to this series; I did bash on the first book in this series a lot because it was so similar to one of my favorite books. Due to my prejudice, I did not much like the first book in this series. It was an enjoyable read, but the characters were too lacking in depth for me, and the entire book just lacked a certain something that would otherwise make it shine, make it memorable.With that said, I lovedthisbook. This is an excellent, excellent sequel; I love being surprised, I love being proved wrong in my pessimism about a book, andCrown of Midnightturned out to be so much more enjoyable than I thought it would be.There is no second-book syndrome here.It is not without its flaws by any means. Celaena remains perfectly...well, perfect, for the most part. The love triangle is persistent and painful, and at more than one point, I wanted to take Dorian and Chaol and justbash their heads together. However, every single character mature and develops, and I did make up my mind as to whom I prefer before the book is over.A complaint I often have in fast-paced plots is that, interestingly enough, they're oftenso boringdespite everything. This was not the case for this book; from the very beginning, I was hooked. The action rarely stops, and even in the quieter, more introspective moments, I never find myself yawning. I finished this book in 2 sittings, rarely finding myself switching books in-between. Given my highly ADHD book-reading personality, this says something about my enjoyment of it and its ability to keep me constantly engrossed.The plot:fast-paced, completely immersing. The plot twists and turns are just interesting enough to keep me absorbed, and are never too far-fetched that they would stretch the boundaries of my disbelief. I absolutely loved it. It was never bogged down by too many flashbacks, the main narrative is Celaena's, alternately Dorian and Chaol's. Their narratives, particularly those of Chaol's, were more on the introspective side, but never bored me, and were short enough so that it did not slow down the rapid pacing of the book. The writing is great; actions scenes were well-done, the dialogue is believable, the verbal style is descriptive and flows well without ever coming close to purple prose.Celaena: My main problem with her in the first book is that Celaena is too perfect. That problem still persists largely in this book, but I found it more tolerable, in part becauseshe breaks down. That's right, our rational, cool-headed, perfectly calm Celaena finally breaks down---and I loved it.She has her Bella Swan moment, and for once, I have no complaints. She literally does not eat, does not bathe. She cries, she is prostate with grief...and it was awesome. I loved seeing her being emotional, I loved seeing her break through her tough outer shell. I loved seeing her come out of it.A familiar, dark fire rippled in her gut, spreading through her, dragging her down into an abyss without end.Celaena Sardothien stood from her chair.I fucking stood up from my chair and shouted ""YEAH,"" at this scene.It is fleeting, in the grand scale of the book, and I do wish she had more moments of vulnerability, of still more development that would make me relate to her more as a character, but I'll take what I can get.Celaena's other fault is not her own...not so much as the author's.The author seems to shy away from the idea that Celaena is an assassin.For a king's assassin, she makes Celaena one in name only. Celaena does not act like an assassin. She only kills when she absolutely has to---by accident, almost. Celaena is not so much an assassin as an investigator, a detective, someone caught in the fray in the middle of a desperate fight who has to kill or be killed. Right at the beginning of the book, Celaena reveals to us that she does not actually kill her targets, but instead helps them to escape. I think this is meant to make us empathize with Celaena as a character, to make her more human.It just makes me respect her less.It's a book about an assassin. I expect an assassin to kill. If I wanted to read a mystery novel, I'd go get one.Give me my fucking assassin, dammit.Celaena doesn't act too smart sometimes, for me, she acts rather foolishly. She trusts people with too much more information than I was comfortable with, despite everything, she still acts more naive than I would expect of someone so seemingly competent. Her actions aren't without consequence, if found out, she could endanger the lives of so many, and she seems to disregard that.There is one plot twist within this book that I desperately, desperately hate. It launches Celaena from mildly perfect right smack into the middle of a Mary Sue stereotype. Ugh. We'll see how that goes.Dorian: for a large part of the book,Dorian is...let's face it...a huge fucking pussy. He doesn't stand up to his father, the king. He is largely passive. He spends the majority of the time resentfully angry at the developing relationship between Celaena and Chaol and whining and not doing much about it besides mope. He is depressed about the fact that Celaena is no longer his pretty pretty assassin-to-be in lovely dresses---and could be, in fact, a cold-blooded killer. Which he knows she is. But he's still shocked. Just SHOCKED. Sigh.Her lovely dresses and ornate clothes were gone, replaced by an unforgiving, close-cut black tunic and pants, her hair pulled back in a long braid that fell into the folds of that dark cloak she was always wearing. She was a beautiful wraith---and when she looked at him, it was like she didn’t even know who he was. He couldn’t help wondering if he’d ever meant anything to Celaena at all.Get over yourself, Dorian!Dorian's character does improve for the better...eventually. It takes a while. Actually, a long while. A teenaged girl could get a lesson or two from Dorian about how to mope. Overall, I do think his character development was one of the better ones depicted within this book. If I had to pick a side, I'd be on Team Dorian for sure.Chaol: I may be showing a definite bias here, butChaol can go screw himself. PURELY OBJECTIVE, OF COURSE. He worries so goddamn much. He has no trust in Celaena's abilities to take care of herself. He acts more like her goddamn mother (who's dead, but whatever) than a potential love interest.This dress, with its close-fitting bodice, long, tight sleeves, and gently flowing skirt, was about as new and different as it came.Which was why, when she ran into Chaol on her way out of her rooms, she wasn’t very surprised when he stopped dead and blinked. Then blinked again.Chaol stood in the hallway, his bronze eyes traveling down the front of her dress, then up again. “You’re not wearing that.”Ok, mom.I hate his constant worrying and fussing over her; it shows a lack of trust, it shows a lack of confidence.Despite Celaena's obvious competence, Chaol hides things from her, he constantly berates her, and basically never trusts her to do her own fucking job. I'm just a little biased. Grumble. Fine. He's really not that bad overall. But I still prefer Dorian.The love triangle: I'm not exaggerating about the continued love triangle here, but I have to admit, it wasn't that bad. The emotions were well-done, the indecisions and internal conflicts were well-depicted, and this is one of the better triangles I've seen within a book. Dare I say it? I like it, and I'm glad that the triangle continues. It makes things interesting, even though if Celaena ever makes a choice and it's the wrong one (according to my opinion, of course), this reader will be very, very upset.Overall: a highly enjoyable book, and goddamn, I have to waithow longuntil the next?",4

They were both dark stalker(ish) romances with kinky smut. This book is shit though, sorry.➥ Adeline (h)was so beyond annoying. She's so fucking dumb, I'm so tired of women being written like this. Like I'm genuinely personally offended that I have to associate with her because never do I meet women who are like this in real life. And by that I mean, these women that act like children, that don't have a single logical, mature cell in their body. It's insulting and we need to start writing female main characters with some respect. This girl was clueless, pathetic and honestly, just overall shallow. I have a similar opinion about Rae, the fmc inHer Soul to Take, but imo, Adeline was even worse.➥ Zane (H)...ew *pukes*. I feel like I'm missing out on some big prank, people like this guy? He's so pathetic, god. This fucker thinks he's so tough (he literally like...says self-affirmations about himself in his inner monologue), he strokes his ego by killing sex traffickers and makes that his hobby, his little quirk. He goes on and on about how those men should burn in hell for what they've done yet here he iscasually and remorselessly stalking and raping a girl in his free time.Even if we put that aside, and just focus on shit like his dirty talk or dick skills (he has none), he's gross and incompetent. As shown by the featured quote above,thisis what we are dealing with. Nothing that came out of his mouth was swoony, hot or sexy to me.I'm going to start out with this because I feel like otherwise it'll get lost in the end of my review and no one will care but can we please stop making sapphic relationships a joke?""It seems every day, my appreciation for Daya grows. She gave me a sense of safety I didn’t realize I was missing. I’m going to have to propose to her soon or something.""This is the fmc talking about her relationship with her best friend. Um, can we not? 😭 It's so easy to justnotwrite shit like this, invalidating sapphic relationships. I don't careee if it's just a joke or whatever, pick something else to joke about or find another way to show your appreciation for your friend, but stop treating sapphic relationships like jokes.I've always defended writing in the contemporary romance genre because it doesn't need to be flowery and classy, in fact, it's annoying when it is.But I've probably never read a book with worse writing than this.Look at this bitch's inner monologue.I need the Tin Man to oil the hinges on my door just as much as I need the Lion's bravery. I'm shaking like a leaf.Really?? A wizard of oz reference?? What even is this, it doesn't take a genius to understand that writing like this is not adequate for a book that is meant to have a dark tone to it. It ruins the atmosphere and necessary formality that is vital to the reader taking this book seriously.I stare at the flower like it's a live tarantula, staring straight back at me and daring me to come closer. If I do, it'll surely eat me alive.""Girl, it is aflower. I'm sick,sickof these shitty metaphors. Not everyone is cut out to be a writer - but especially not an author who writes like this.I'm scared, but I'm also stupid. So, I'm not leaving.Her self-awareness doesn't make me like her more. Why is it necessary to have a clueless, idiot as the fmc, eugh.Gives me the heebie jeebies.This is apublished book.Have we not evolved past this type of colloquial writing? It's just awful and genuinely takes away from the atmosphere the author should be trying to create in these types of books.Maybe I'll eat some Cheerios. They say those are good for the heart right?To top it off we get modern references too. I don't like when authors insert modern world references into their writing. No one wants to read about Cheerios when they're reading a dark smutty romance.She's so prim and proper, and I'm so...not. Where she holds herself with regality and grace, I have a terrible habit of slumping and sitting with my legs open.Omg, she's not like other girls!!! And to think that I thought I couldn't possibly hate this fmc more and she pulls the 'i'm not like other girls' line.Chunks of concrete fly into my eyes as more bullets ping around me. I grunt, rubbing at my lids to clear my visionThis is from the male perspective. Other than the fact that this whole sentence was unnecessary, if concrete flew into your eyes, you know damn well you'd fall to the ground like a bug. These details are not only inaccurate but also beyond unnecessary. Even fantasy authors do research so they know how long it takes to die out from blood loss but you aren't even aware that CHUNKS OF CONCRETE can't fly into your eyes without you becoming immobilized from pain? Have you never had anything get stuck in your eye? Jesus.""As much as I hate to say this to you, I am no stranger to a woman's pussy and what it feels like when it weeps for me.""Point and laugh, everyone. If you think this is top-tier dirty talk...oml. Moreover, this is while he isforcing himself onto herand she is turned on and he basically takes that as an invitation to do whatever the fuck he wants. I'm not someone who's picky with consentin books, I'm cool with a dub-con situation, but the logic in this book is just not logicing. Many sexual assault survivors deal with guilt about their assault because they were turned on during the process. Arousal is not an okay, many people get aroused when their body hears etc. anything inherently sexual. The fmc's inner monologue also didn't help because she never said that she wanted it but that she wouldn't admit it and blah blah. She begged him to stop, talked about how it hurt, and he left her crying in a ball after he fucked her.Maybe this is just me, but I like fictional men because they treat their girls right. Leon is a great example of ""I hate everyone but you"", but this dude is just hatingherand treating her like absolute garbage. Me personally, I don't find that so cute. Maybe it's just me though, idk...So, this guy basically rapes her a shit ton of times,which is ironic bc this guy is always swimming in his saviour complex. He supposedly rescues women and children from sex trafficking rings. Which like...nice ig? I just feel like that was just a plot device for him to be likeable.Because he shows no kindness, no tenderness and no charmingness, in any way shape or form, I supposethe reader has to rely on a fact that establishes his supposed morality to find him the least bit likable.This is also used as an excuse to write more and more internal monologue about how he can't imagineeee what it's like to go through whatever blah blah andhe's always trying to be cool and slick while confronting the sex traffickers as if this is just some adrenaline rush to him.He's just sohypocriticaltalking about how any guy that forces himself onto women/children deserves to go to hell and be tortured (Which is his hobby. He like...likes to torture people...idk that's lame to me. It's like when guys flex about punching shit when they're mad). Meanwhile, here he is, going into this girl's house, forcing himself onto her, justifying it because of the girl being turned on, and then leaving her there lying on the floor curled into herself and crying. Feelingviolated.He even saysI'm going to make her fall in love with every single fucked up part of me.And...I think what I find so unappealing about this male character is that you don't see him trying to win over the fmc. He just has an ego where he decides shewilldo what he wants because he's powerful enough to get it and so it shall be. And that's...boring to me. Again, I'm no wimp when it comes to dark romance, but this is just so boring. Not only is this book horribly, unnecessarily long, but it's also boring because, who wants to watch a man rape a woman in her house 3 different ways for 800 pages straight? I mean, personally, not me.Anyway, let's talk about how bad the smut was because I think that's what made it the saddest for me lmao. So let's refresh, the writing was bad, the characters were bad, the plot was bad...but there was still potential in the sex section. Yet, I was disappointed once again. I've already established that it was rapey (it's in the TWs but it doesn't really make it any better imo). Not so cute. But even the ideas themselves were lame. The first time Zane fucks Adeline, it's with a gun. Now, this is meant to be all quirky and kinky but it was written terribly imo. The dirty talk revolving the idea wasn't good and the actual description ignited nothing within me.If youdowant to read a good gun sex scene, you should look intoHer Soul for Revenge. Not only is it incredibly hot, well drawn out, with great dialogue and variety, but it also has a fantastic character dynamic. The fmc in that book is so much more badass, so the playing field is even and so much more fun. Both characters take part in the teasing and dirty talk and ugh, let me tell you, it was years better than the sex scene in this one.There was another sex scene that involved Zane ""catching"" or ""chasing"" Adeline, which seemed fun, I was totally down. But again, imo it was badly executed and was much better done by Harley Laroux's soul series. Unfortunately, I don't quite remember which book, I think (think) it wasHer Soul for Revengeif I'm not mistaken. They also had a sort of 'i catch and chase you and fuck you' scene but it was outside in the woods, much longer and much hotter. Another aspect that I think made it better in Harley Laroux's was that there was explicit consent given beforehand, and a safe-word if necessary. So, it was more playful and fun and even more personal, which made the chemistry much more believable. The aftercare was also beautifully, tenderly done, which is what we want!! The men taking care of and admiring their women, while also feeding into his and her fantasies :)So, on top of complaining about thequalityof the smut, I'm also here to complain about thequantity. So again, this book has no romantic aspect, thin plot and bad characters, so people read it for the smut.Yet, I had to wait until around40%to read the first sex scene!!!BOOOOOO 🍅🍅🍅. And when we finally get to the smut, this is what we get:""You're so fucking creamy,"" he rasps.Is this supposed to have me screamin and creamin or? Anyway...The mystery aspect was so fucking dull. I do not understand how people cared about the little diary entries and her dead grandma at all. I read spoiler reviews of who the killer was and I'm really not that surprised but I also justdid not care.Lastly, Ididdnf this book, and I guess it is possible for it to get better (i think i heard the second book is better) but I'm really not interested in giving this book another chance. And that's ignoring the fact that this book isso unnecessarily long.Once again,no one does it like Harley Laroux.I can't wait for her to release the third book of the trilogy aaa!!━━━━━━━━━━━ ♡ ━━━━━━━━━━━",1
1240,"Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse, #1)","now before i get into it i gotta say that even though this book is marketed at 18+, i personally consider it 21+ it can be very triggering for some so tread lightly. if you wanna get into dark romance, don’t let this book be your gateway into the genre. it’s very graphic and i absolutely do not condone any of the actions set in this book.anywayyys, I literally smacked my forehead and dragged my hand down my face so many times while reading this book. i thought i was desensitized to smut at this point but i was shocked, to say the least, at the words my eyes were reading. Adeline is better than me because i know if a man that looked like Zade approached me, i’d fold instantly.this was honestly such a fun, jaw dropping, shirt ripping, bedsheet gripping, panties dropping, and knee trembling book. i was up all night sweaty and reading until the crack ass of dawn. reading this book wasn’t enough, i need to eat it, and inject it into my veins.every minute i was reading about Zade and Adeline doing exactly what they did in this book, i felt like i passed away. like i’m so dead serious right now when i say there’s something about them that scratches an itch in the deep crevices of my brain.and hear me out. sometimes we just turn left, then ignore all the red flags, then rinse and repeat. 😅😅😅did i question my sanity while reading this book? abso-fucking-lutely !!!now into the actual context and structure of this whole book. it needs a lot of work/editing. the writing was atrocious and kinda cringe. like tf do you mean by “a pregnant pause” ?!?! are you having a baby or some shit? golly. like the writing was like how gen Z talk and communicate. and i say that being a gen Zer myself. nonetheless, it didn’t take away from my actual enjoyment of the story. and the whole murder mystery wasn’t interesting in the slightest. i’m no literary analyst but as a reader i can say at least the vibes were there.",4
1241,"Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse, #1)","Regardless of the raving reviews this book has I couldn't finish it. I'm really not into the whole forced strait up sexual assault trope and was not expecting it.. Basically this guy is a stalker and he's obsessed with this girl. He breaks into her house a bunch and sacres her//leaves her creepy gifts, then he forces her to have sex with him more than once... Like she's legitimately begging him not to touch her and is crying... but at the same time he's a good guy that saves girls from sex trafficking (am I supposed to care???), and also he's hot and she starts finding him kinda desirable on the part where I left off, but I'm going to stop you right there... nothing will make me like this dude. He is a rapist. There's no gray area there. I don't care if she eventually starts to like him. I don't care that he does nice things occasionally. I can't look past the rapist thing. If you don't like stories about this sort of thing either, I would not reccomend this book to you. It probably gets good at some point.. I mean it has great reviews. Like maybe he becomes really great and they have a ""sweet"" connection at some point, but I don't care. The only way this story would have gotten better for me is if he dies miserably. I'm really not trying to like this dude and justify his gross behavior for the sake of smut. Thank you, but no thank you. 🤚On to the next 💋",1

It just has dark elements in it. It was surface level and hardly anything was explored.Let me correct myself: nothing was explored.All action, no development. The characters had no backstory.

1251,"Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse, #1)","This book was fucking corny. It was awful, but also a fucking cornfest. When reading a “dark” romance, you expect a little more depth and triggering themes to accompany the story. Maybe a little drugs, death, etc. This book combines a goofy ass hacker vigilante stalker, and an insufferable heroine, and claims itself to be a dark romance. It’s a joke. The main character Adeline is supposedly the “manipulator” and Z or the stalker is the “shadow?” I don’t rlly fucking remember the names because it was so stupid and unnecessary. Anyways, the story proceeds with Addie staying at this creepy fucking house for no fucking reason where countless people have died, introduces a whole ass fuckinf ghost, and then promptly forgets that part of the plot. Like okay cool beans ig. Then Z sees her jn some book signing and stalks her like insanely. Okay Z is the corniest mf I’ve ever read in my life. He’s this dub-con, psycho (he literally sends her a pair of cut off hands when she lets some creep finger bang her) stalker who is actually a self taught mastermind hacker who saves kids and women from sex trafficking. Yep. I’m serious. It’s an absolute cringe fest. Her bff is also a “vigilante.” The word choice the author uses is so juvenile it made me scream. I mean do we live in a Neil Breene movie? The “darkness” this book promises is completely gone at this point. The funniest and most ironic part however, is that Mr. Savior, aka mr. I-cant-bear-to-see-innocent-kids-raped-at-the-hands-of-powerful-men-and-I-have-to-save-them-with-my-chiseled-jaw-and-ugly-scar, RAPES THE MAIN CHARACTER WITH A GUN. I mean are you kidding me? I don’t mind dub con, but Atleast take a look at the damn plot author. YOU CANT HAVE HIM SAVE RAPE SURVIVORS AND THEN RAPE TNE MAIN CHARACTER?! The later sex scenes are a little better because she’s more “attracted” to him and apparently gets off on the fear like okay whatever woman. He even tells her to get off his dick and start running because she loves the chase. Like she’s on his dick and then gets off its so fucking funny like a damn Jack in the box. Anyways, back to the child trafficking sacrifices drinking blood scenes. These scenes are so corny, I mean there’s these senators who are doing it and Z and his group are trying to hack into their society which hey? Wanna know the name of theyre creepy dangerous group? THE SOCIETY?! Like hello?! Is this wattpad novel? It’s so funny. Anyways these scenes were the only thing keeping me reading this book. One reason was because it was so corny it was funny, and the other was because it was actually interesting seeing how fuckimg lame someone can make sex trafficking. I mean come on. Also apparently Addies great grandma also had a stalker and was supposedly killed by her husband? And Addie was targeted by the society to be sold because she’s pretty? It’s all so much and so poorly executed.Okay this book has several major flaws. But the biggest one is trying to have too many storylines at once. You have the romance and sex, the stalker and fear, the sex trafficking, and the grandmas murder. It’s wayyy to much. Pair that with a drawn out plot, juvenile writing, corny ass scenes, and insufferable characters. That my friend, creates a bad book. To be fair, at some parts it was so bad it was good so it proves to be a really good comedy if you’re interested!",1

1253,"Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse, #1)","When he rapes her multiple times but it’s ‘justified’ because he kills pedophiles and sex traffickers for a living???IDK why I read this when I know I don’t like dark romance, so this is entirely on me. This is romanticised abuse. Nothing about this relationship was romantic in the slightest. This is literally a prime example of Stockholm syndrome. I AM SO SCARED OF MEN, IT ISN'T EVEN FUNNY ANYMORE.I don't like to publicly write mean reviews about books I don't like, but this one deserves it. This book is just so incredibly harmful and perpetuates dangerous ideas. I truly cannot fathom how someone can genuinely enjoy this book and then recommend it on TikTok where so many of its users are underage. Like, my 14-year-old sister's friend got ahold of this book and read it??? That's not okay. This book literally perpetuates the idea that abuse and rape is normal and that a guy can love and care for you even if he does those horrible things to you. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? That is SO harmful and is a recipe for disaster. Don't even get me started on the themes of consensual-non-consensual sex in this book. If it was truly that, it would be discussed prior to the actual act of sex, rather than him saying stupid shit like ""I'm only doing this because I know you want it"" after she REPEATEDLY told him no. This is so fucking harmful to rape victims and belittles what they went through as it implies that if you even felt a little bit of pleasure whilst being raped that it wasn't actually rape. I GENUINELY WANT TO GET VIOLENT RN. I know this is fiction, but (1) stuff like this happens in real life, and (2) it is so harmful and has the ability to shape people's ways of thinking.I, wholeheartedly, do not understand how anybody can find this book romantic. The fact that I've seen people on TikTok say that Zade is their top book BF genuinely concerns me and isn't something I want to think too much about 😭. I was also attacked on TikTok for saying Zade's behaviour was scary, specifically the moment where she says she has an IUD and he says he didn't notice because she sleeps so heavily. Someone said he was just joking??? Nothing about violating someone in their sleep is funny to me TBH. I would be petrified if someone said that to me.",1

The plot is essentially theZade (H)saving sex trafficked girls and women while hunting down and killing pedos.Addie (h)spends the whole book attempting to solve her great-grandmothers unsolved murder.The vigilante stuff was pretty fun, though it would have been better if the hero’s reason for risking his life wasn’t just ‘cause I like to kill bad people’. Also, do I give a shit about the heroine’s murdered grannie? Not at all, yet trying to figure out who the killer is, is a large part of this book.What I want to focus on is…don’t even try to act surprised with this…the ✨smut✨This was basically the only reason I started this book which is pretty sad, but yanno I love me a psychotic hero. Basically the hero stalks the heroine throughout half the book after he saw her for 2 seconds at her book signing. Man literally fell in lust on the spotHe begins watching her from outside her house and taunting her over text message 😌 His mind games were absolutely the best part about this. He would break into her house and leave roses for her and eventually began leaving notes likeI'll be seeing you soon, little mouse.I never thought the endearment ‘little mouse’ was hot, but with the context that he’s the cat and she’s the prey just makes this 🥰There’s a point where the heroine goes to a club and meets this guy, Archie. While she’s at the club, Zade messages herUNKNOWN:Sneaking off with random men, little mouse? If I catch his hands anywhere near you, they’ll end up in your mailbox by morning.Of course the heroine doesn’t believe him so he takes Archie home with her. This is where it gets juicy now. She decides to take him into the sunroom, so Zade could see her get fingered by Archie. Which by the way…was pretty hot ngl“Do you sing pretty when you come, Addie…let me hear it.”OKAY OKAY IM GETTING DISTRACTED BECAUSE THIS SCENE WHTH THE OM WAS GOOD FOR NO REASON. Zade interrupts the moment by banging on the door and luring Archie outside…where he kidnaps and proceeds to torture and murder him💞What does my baby Zade do after? Well he’s a man of his word so naturally, he follows up on it–Before I can think about what I’m doing, I tip the lid off with my foot.Hands.Severed hands are in the box, just like I fearedNaturally, he now has to punish her further for letting another man touch her. How does he do that? Oh by fucking her with his gun–“Good girl,” he breathes. “Open wider, baby.” The hand still holding my thong to the side nudges against my thigh. Without thought, my thighs instinctively fall further apart.…“I can feel how tight your pussy is. The way it grips onto my gun when I slide it out—so fucking pretty.”—Not only is there praise kink but he’s fucking her with his gun🤪🤪😌The chase scenes were alsoUGHincredible. He would tell her to run or hide from him just so he could catch her. If she got caught, she’d get “punished”. I’m out here questioning these ‘punishments’ because they sound fucking great to me. Then we have the mirror maze scene which was just another breed of hot-He turns his head and our eyes clash in one of the mirrors. My heart drops as I tear my eyes away to look around and see his eyes pinned on me from several directions, it’s the most intense feeling I’ve ever experienced.…My eyes lock back onto his, and a slow smile takes over his face. He leans in close, his lips skating across mine as he watches me slowly come apart at the seams, all the while grinning at me.The way Zade is described gave me goosebumps. This man is literally so fucking fine 🛐—I face him, eyeing him closely. He’s relaxed into his seat, his long legs spread, one hand draped over the wheel and the other resting on the armrest between us.Anyway, I have no words regarding the heroine becauseshe was kinda just…there taking the spot that should be mine🙄 the audacitythere’s so many one liners that are just too hilarious for me to ignore so here are some of my favorites•He’s manipulating her, and that’s a big no-no. No one manipulates my girl but me.•“Don’t cry, little mouse,” he coos.“It’s going to get so much worse.”•”These are soaked,” he rasps out, his lips still wet from his saliva.“That’s called discharge.”•“Oh, God—” she sucks in a sharp breath.“That’s right, I am your God.”•“You don’t want this, baby?

Idk why he is so praised when he’s a hypocrite😭This review contains minor spoilers, nothing unpredictable or what you haven’t already seen on booktok. But I’m still warning you.I was so curious about this Zade Meadows everyone raved about. And I was still surprised.This motherfcuker played with my feelings like no other. I couldn’t decide whether to love him or hate him. His dick will make you bipolar.He’s not morally grey, he is morally black. At least when it comes to his personal life.Sure, he is doing something good in this life by killing pedos and abusers. But maaaaan does he need to learn some boundaries.He falls in love with Adeline the second he sees her and becomes her stalker. But the worst part for me was that he enjoys making her scared and playing with her sanity. He threatens her and makes some questionable choices. Like chopping off her date’s hands and sending them to her. And watching her sleep like a creep. He pulled an edward cullen on her.Now to the main bitch. She is honestly the perfect fit for him. I tried feeling sorry for her ass some times but no. She gets off of her fear and gets wet from pain. And then provokes him on purpose. So I was like you know what? Enjoy girl.The plot itself was interesting. There was a lot of intrigue going on and the smut made my pussy throb and my sheets soaked. I couldn’t stop reading it chapter after chapter. If it wasn’t for my new meds, I would’ve finished the book in 2 days.But definitely check TW beforehand.Btw the book itself is so pretty🥲 i loved the format. It’s dual pov and each has their own art.The main reason i am reducing one star is because the first two times they had sex, he forced himself on her. They both knew it. People excuse this by saying it was cnc and even though I never kink shame, it was just not something i could easily fathom. Not only that but he also physically abuses her by slapping and choking and etc. He also punishes her all the time for the littlest things. And never listens to what she says. Just because she came in the end doesn’t make it okay for me. But i mean she didn’t seem to mind so ig that’s what counts. And if you’re into that, I understand.This is also the reason I couldn’t fall for Zade despite him saying lots of cute shit. If you follow my updates, you know lol.Would I sleep with him tho? Probably.Would I want him as my own stalker? No, I would move away but tbh I’d enjoy the attention.The ending is a bitch. It’s a damn cliffhanger and i have to know how it ends!

1262,"Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse, #1)","I'm sorry, this was awful, but I want to count it LOLTW: SA discussion in this reviewThe worst thing about this book, for me, is how overly corny it is in its attempt to justify itself.Adeline is being stalked - the dude is literally obsessed with her, bugging her house and killing dudes who touch her and leaving their hands in a box for her to find on her doorstep. Stalked - he even sexually assaults her without her consent multiple times, telling her she'll get on the same page as him eventually and want it.Now, I've been reading some dark romances for the fuck of it, and I could honestly get over it because I've learned that there are parameters in books where exploring shit like this can be cathartic.But one of the hard limits is trying to excuse the behavior, and that's what this book does at every turn.Z isn't just a stalker with a desire to assault the target of his obsession - he's also a super rich vigilante who works to stop sex trafficking!!! He saves women who are being abused by men!!! He's so uwu righteous and morally correct!!! While he rapes the object of his own obsession, convinced she'll want it one day!!!!Like - you lose me completely there. I will not be manipulated by ""okay he does this to her but look at all the girls and women he's saving!! Look how disgusted he is by older men who aren't hot like him preying on women!!!"" It just makes the whole thing awful for me. I'd rather he was just a billionaire businessman, I'd be fine with most of it then LOLPlus this book adds a weird 'my great grandmother had a stalker' story to it in order to.. I don't know?

And the “hot” quotes aren’t even cute when given context babes. Anyways (fml😑) this book wasn’t banned for nothing (please check all trigger warnings, although they don't justify shit in this case). The characters make me want to commit a crime. The HYPOCRISY from Zade and the STUPIDITY from Addie. On the bright side, I read something suitable for the Halloween season. I was truthfully experiencing fomo because it was so praised??? (as you can imagine I was bamboozled) Now REGRET. So ya this reading experience was genuinely HORRIFIC🥰🫶 (i.e. my updates where I went through the 7 stages of grief🤡 mainly just rage)DNF at 55% {EDIT *SpongeBob 12 hours later*- I decided to skim the rest so I could write a proper review (it’s amazing how fast you can read when you skip over a bunch of stuff😍), specifically for Gigi's murder investigation and the “big cliffhanger”. I googled spoilers too. Now I’m truly FREE and I can move on🙏. Btw, I saw someone comment on ig today “Zade is the standard” and I want to CRY😭}.I feel terrible writing this review but it’s just not for me. I can acknowledge that H.D. Carlton is a very unique author... Maybe the books get better (I'm being too nice) but I don’t have the time or energy for that anymore🧘‍♀️. I need to return to my sweet love interests and get away from this toxic shiza🏃‍♀️<3. Read what YOU enjoy reading. You live and you learn so it’s all good :)Oh and if anyone outside of this app ever asks me about this book, I know nothing🫡------Edit almost one year later- I had already dropped by rating from 2 stars to 1 star (and I NEVER rate anything 1 star). I would like to formally remove the ""I feel terrible writing this"" part of my review. Every time I see Zade the r4pist getting praised on socials it feels like an actual violation and I get more and more angry. You know what, no. It actually makes me sad. This stuff is terrifying, it's not even funny. And I apologize for getting all serious on y'all when I'm usually always silly in my reviews. I just hit my breaking point and I wanted to share with those that also feel this book is damaging. And for some scary reason, an unpopular opinion. But I see you.",1
1265,"Haunting Adeline (Cat and Mouse, #1)","Oh my gosh. Am at a loss for words. This was so good and addicting 🤌I was hooked from the first page right up till the end. The plot, subplot, the romance and the characters were so well written. I have read H.D. Carlton'sDoes It Hurtbefore, which was the first book I read of hers and knew right away what a talented writer she is. I think this might be an even better work.Now I won't deny this book is not for anyone. Either you'll like it, enjoy it or be disgusted and hate it. There's no in between. I went in thinking it's a dark romance but oh boy, it really wasdark.Some of the things that happen between Adeline and Zade, I'm glad it's just a work of fiction and nothing more.Adelineis someone I liked instantly. She has life to her, personality but the only thing that kind of bugged me a bit was how questionable her life choices were at times. Seriously, the girl had a death wish. Are we really surprised by the ending?🥲Coming toZade,oof.. I don't think I've ever had such conflicted thoughts about the love interest. He's such a complex character. Yes, he's twisted, man doesn't know how to approach a girl right, but at the same time he's doing things that make him to be such a good person. Notice- a good person, not a good romantic 😩 But he did care for Adeline and protect her arse whenever he could. You see why I'm conflicted?The chemistry between the two is really good and the smut is super juicy. The murder mystery aspect was something I enjoyed and how 'Z' handled the crimes.Anyhoo, I'm looking forward to reading the sequel. This one did cure my reading slump. The reason I give it four stars instead of five is cause of the gun play scene, which was a bit much😅Disclaimer - Throughout the book, there were some scenes, especially the gun play, the stalking and falling for the stalker, which I do not agree with. It's a work of fiction, and that brings comfort to me knowing that this is not real. My rating and enjoyment level of the book doesn't mean I'm agreeing to it to happen to anyone in reality. The book is not meant for the weak hearted and the triggers are heavy. Before picking it up, please think through.⚠️TW- Graphic violence, human trafficking, stalking, child trafficking, sexual assault, gun play, somnophilia, bondage and degradation.⚠️",4
1266,The Love Hypothesis,"I want to say this is a case of “It’s not the book, it’s me.” But then again, isn’t that the case for every book we end up disliking that everyone else enjoyed?The Love Hypothesisfollows Olive, a PhD student who wants to prove to her best friend that she has moved on and is dating. With no way to prove it, she kisses the first man she sees, which ends up being none other than Dr. Carlsen, known as one of the most unapproachable and critical professors. With his own reasoning, he agrees to become Olive’s fake boyfriend. But what starts as a fake relationship and fake feelings later turns into what Olive wishes were real instead.Olive is a woman in STEM, but that is really all she is. I admit, I loved this representation, and her experience as a scholar conducting research felt realistic, especially considering she’s not American (she’s Canadian), she’s not male, and she’s pretty young (26). Most of these end up being boundaries for young folk pursuing PhD careers in America, and it’s impressive to see representation like this. This was probably my favorite part of the book because Olive tells us how it’s been difficult for her to participate in a rigorous program like this, from being denied opportunities, not being believed in, to being seen as inferior, all because she’s a young woman in a predominantly male-dominated curriculum. While I’m not a STEM student, I even see it myself in the political field I study in. Men teach most classes, most advisors and major professors are also male, most students in classes end up being men, and everything else is usually male-dominated.Other than that, there was nothing.One part of the problem is Adam himself. Adam felt very, verybland.It was difficult to understand his personality and the type of person he was other than moody and sullen because it’s something we are constantly and repeatedly told, especially from Olive. I usually like fictional men like him, even if the way he acts and looks is nothing new, but this case didn’t work for me.You could say he needed much more seasoning.Not only that, but by visualizing what I read, I couldn’t picture Olive for the life of me. All I remember from her is that she is a PhD student in the Biology Department at Stanford University, is Canadian, 5”8, and I guess she has brown hair based on the cover. And . . . yeah, that’s it. Visually, I could envision Adam more than Olive, yet we spend the entire book in Olive’s mind (since it’s told from her point of view). This all ties back to the writing and how difficult it was to enjoy the book more because of how little description was given to the characters. Adam, for instance, felt like he needed more personality. I understand him being sullen and broody is part of it (which, as I’ve said before, is perfectly fine with me and understandable), but I feel like it has to do less with that and more with just the mere fact that Adam is just . . . Adam. The whole book, we don’t really know what Olive looks like or what she likes, and all we know about Adam is that he is ayoung, hot-shot professorwho hardly ever smiled and went through tough situations as a PhD student himself. Oh, and we can’t forget that he’s big, especially when you’re reminded every fucking page.That was it.Speaking of, Olive’s personality also felt a little childish sometimes.The situation that led to Olive kissing Adam (without knowing, of course) is completely unrealistic, so it’s one you need to put your logic to the side for.It made no sense to me how a PhD student, one who is researching pancreatic cancer in one of the best Biology departments of the United States, would kiss a random man she saw in the hallway because she wants to prove to her best friend that she truly is over the boy her best friend wants to date.Because . . . yeah, that’s the actual situation.Olive’s best friend, Anh, wants to date Jeremy, Olive’s ex. Olive is over him and wants nothing to do with him, but Anh thinks it’s breaking the girl code by dating Jeremy, even though Olive knows Anh really likes Jeremy. So to prove that she’s over him and is dating someone else, she kisses Adam when she sees the opportunity that Anh can see them.Pretty unrealistic scenario for a PhD student, if you ask me.Also, it’s not exactly stated, but Olive may or may not be in the asexual spectrum, specifically demisexuality. It’s briefly mentioned in the beginning (even the term is used) and when she and Adam are about to have sex, she mentions to Adam,“It’s not that I want to not have sex. I just . . . don’t particularly want to have it. There is something weird about my brain, and my body, and—I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I don’t seem to be able to experience attraction like other people. Like normal people. I tried to just . . . just to do it, to get it over with, and the guy I did it with was nice, but the truth is that I just don’t feel any . . .” She closed her eyes. This was difficult to admit. “I don’t feel any sexual attraction unless I actually get to trust and like a person, which for some reason never happens. Or, rarely. It hadn’t, not in a long time, but now—I really like you, and I really trust you, and for the first time in a million years I want to—”For starters, I literally got second-hand embarrassment, and second, I can’t help but wish it was was expanded more on. It was as if the author just wanted to add more to Olives lacking personality so she sprinkled some pretty damn humiliating ace representation.Many people might not realize how ignorant it really is when you take a misrepresented and underrepresented sexual orientation and make your character say “there is something wrong with [her] brain,” making it seem like she “isn’t normal” because she experiences sexual attraction differently than “normal people”. Saying this is stereotypical, ignorant, and generally rude.Part of these quibbles made the romance more unrealistic and less believable. I had everything I love: professor x student, grumpy x sunshine, and fake dating.But all good things must come to an end.Because of the inability to imagine Olive, not appreciate an unseasoned broody man, and express concern over a PhD student's attitude at certain times, the romance also failed. There were definitely some of the good moments I love in a romance: the firstrealkiss, feeling the comfort of the other’s touch, realizing you’re falling for for someone you thought you would only see for 10 minutes, but the chemistry felt off. It takes a while for the two to kiss with real feelings inside the two, and while I love a slow-burn, I am still always about that emotional connection, and Olive and Adam felt like they didn’t have it. I firmly believe part of it has to do with the fake dating itself. Some of their moments felt awkward and even forced that I wondered how the two would develop feelings. They were also in moments where they had been “dating” for a while now, in a way the two would really know what to expect, yet they still fumbled like two teenagers experiencing love for the first time. In a way, they were, but I didn’t like how it played out for a PhD student and professor with a PhD. It just made it too unrealistic. There weren’t enough moments between them that made me root for them as a real couple and hope for the best. I even feel as if they weren't friends just because everything they were doing together was part of their whole “We're dating, so we need people to see us” scheme. Their moments felt completely forced, and not even because they’re fake dating.They just felt boring.While I had no problem with the writing style itself, I expected to be told more about Olive and Adam. I couldn’t understand how or why Adam liked Olive. Other than her being nice and intelligent, there wasn’t anything to appreciate.Olive first had a crush on Adam, but based on her inner monologue, that crush quickly turned into “I love him” mode, which I was unable to understand where it came from. Most of the moments Adam and Olive have are part of their fake dating scheme (they want Anh, other students, and faculty to see them for reasons. Don’t ask). While they talk professionally and personally, it made her crush on Adam realistic and understandable (a crush is easily made, anyway), but the whole love thing felt like it came out of the blue.And the sex scene?We don't talk about it.I wish I could say I laughed at the humor, but I truly didn’t laugh at anything. Well, I did laugh at the stupidity of this book.The side characters also felt too immature for me, especially Anh. She forced Olive to interact with Adam, like the sunscreen situation, the car situation, and the lap situation. Some of the situations (like miscommunication) were ridiculous and could have been solved easily if they literally just talked like the ‘adults’ they were.Overall,The Love Hypothesishad zero appreciation from me. I hoped to see some of the relationship development grow on me, but it just felt tedious. I hardly found myself smiling and laughing (like an idiot), which I usually do with books like these, but this one only felt dull.So if you’re still interested in reading this, please ignore me and my emotionless heart right now and give it a chance. You might end up finding a new favorite if you think about it. If not, then you can join me, and we can question our feelings together.ARC provided by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",1
1267,The Love Hypothesis,"Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokUpdate: I made a TikTok about this book!https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8F6eLXf/Previous review: Why does that look like Kylo Ren and Rey wearing lab coats thoI have a reputation for being a harsh reviewer, but honestly-- I'm just immune to hype. If I like a book, I like a book, whether it's popular or not. Usually, I find myself not liking hyped books, so I tend to avoid them, but as someone who works in STEM and did lab research, something about the premise of this book was constantly beckoning me. I NEEDED it.Now that I have read the book, I have some thoughts.LIKES✔️ The STEM angle.I did get the impression while reading this that the author was on comfortable and familiar territory. I felt that way about reading LOVE ON THE BRAIN, too. It blends into the narrative in a really nice and satisfying way. You get the, ""Oh yeah, I'm reading about science! SCIENCE RULES!"" vibe, but it never feels inaccessible. You're in on the joke. That's not always easy to do with technical writing, so I admired that in this romance.✔️Adam.Look, he might have the personality of a sour glass of milk, but do we stan a gentle giant of a consent king? Yes the fuck we do. I'm starting to suspect that Ivy League Professor love interests are basically celebrity romances for stuck-up dark academia girlies. The way people swoon in this man's presence like they're at a Daisy and the Six concert in Daisy and the Six just cracks me up.✔️The food descriptions.I'm a sucker for a food-friendly romance. And if you're going to have a book set in Palo Alto, you gotta dig in (literally! nom nom nom) to the California food scene. Which this book did. To my appreciation.✔️ The weird cheap dates.They're students and supposed to be broke. So I don't know, I thought it was kind of cute how one of their dates was a stereotypical coffee date and another was a trip to get their flu shots together. I don't know, it just felt very college. (Plus, pro-vaccine!)✔️ The sex scenes.Were honestly fine! But BookTok would have you believe that this isFifty Shades of Science, though, and it is not. On the spice scale, this ranks so low that a Midwestern housewife might actually use it to season her mashed potato casserole. This isn't even a chili. It's black pepper with a kick. Yes, it's open door, but it's very vanilla and pretty brief.DISLIKES❌️ My sense of disbelief has been thoroughly snapped.The entirety of this book hinges on Olive kissing Adam (not consensually) to trick her friend into thinking she's over a guy. Then they fake date to (1) continue this ruse of lying to her friend and (2) trick Adam's superiors into thinking that he isn't going to move away and get a better job. I haven't read this much pathological-lying-for-fun-and-profit since Sophia Kinsella'sShopaholicseries. Lying is not just a cute little misunderstanding. I know people can be nonconfrontational but this really did feel pathological.❌️The demisexual(?) rep.Olive appears to be coded as demisexual because at one point she tells Adam that she has a low sex drive and can't really have sex with people unless she feels an emotional connection. But then, ofc, she becomes a total size queen who's horny for Adam... and it starts to feel kind of like she was ""cured"" by sex. I will not understate the value of a sexual relationship that makes you feel emotionally and psychologically ""seen,"" but if Olive was demisexual, I wish she had used the label and there had been more context for her sexuality, and why she feels the way she does.❌️He can fit her whole boob in his mouth.I did not need to know this. But now, alas, I do. Also she's the tiniest smol-smol pixie girl to ever stand at a mighty 5'8"" and there's like several mentions of how Adam's monstercock and monsterhands are so BIIIIIIIG that he might, idk, snap her like a wishboner. I rolled my eyes over all of this a lot. I know it's a kink, but it's not mine.❌️There's a lot of hate for the sciences in a book that's supposed to be empowering to women.I wouldn't say this if it weren't also present in the other book by the author that I read, but... for a ""STEMinist"" book, it kind of feels like this book hates women in the sciences. Both this book and LotB had conflicts that revolved around the heroine suffering some HUGE (police-involvement-level) harassment campaigns as a result of her gender that interfered with her work. Both this book and LotB feature heroines who seem almost disillusioned with their work and aren't really sure they're in academia for the right reasons. Both this book and LotB kind of give the impression that it's every girl for herself in the science world, which P.S.sucksby the way, so it ends up giving not-like-other-girls.❌️BIG MISUNDERSTANDINGS EVERYWHERE.If you like this trope, you'll be happy. But I'm not a fan of big misunderstandings where both otherwise reasonable characters are deliberately and out-of-characteristically obdurate for the sole purpose of furthering the plot.So overall, this book was fine. I'm surprised the author gets as much hate as she does for her books because they do what they set out to do. LOVE ON THE BRAIN is definitely a superior work, though, so I'm actually super curious about her most recent releases because she does seem to be improving with each subsequent book. My advice is to go into these expecting an airport chicklit sort of read, except with a hefty seasoning of some easily digestible science facts.I know I'm probably forgetting to say more stuff but I think my review more than substantiates the rating.2.5 to 3 stars",3
1268,The Love Hypothesis,"idk what kind of drugs y’all are on but i evidently did not receive my portionmaybe manvi is right and i just really hate popular booksbut, this was just… not good?the pureagonyof having to read this. yes, i was held at gun point and forced to finish it, do not ask questions, i am not allowed to talk about iti actually picked this to have something fun and easy to read in-between studying but instead i got this infuriating reading experience and a massive spike in my heart rate just from sheer annoyance. you will hear from my cardiologist, believe me, he’s not happy.this was just plain boring. do i care about the couple? no. they could have not ended up together and it would have made no difference to me. why would i root for people who can’t manage to open their goddamn mouth and just talk to each other about their feelings? how does anyone even have relationships? the miscommunication in this was just *chefs kiss* and not in a good way. everyone and their mum knew that adam was in love with olive and yet. yes this man who let’s you coat him in sunscreen and buys you your disgusting pumpkin spice latte (yes, i am with adam on this one. but. hear me out: i’m allergic, so.) and looks at you like the sun shines out of your ass is definitely head over heels for another woman. makes sense.also, the whole spiel about adam being this huge asshole when in reality he a. wasn’t and b. was actually right in that one specific instance and just doing his job of „raising“ good future scientists by giving them pointers how to do good research. and yet i had to sit through that whole drama of „buhu, how dare you date this mean prof, who made me do actual work on my dissertation, i will now hate you, because you are enabling him by dating him“. first of all, have you considered that you’re just doing shit work. second, how the fuck is it olive’s problem. why did i have to read this. it was such an unnecessary conflict.there’s this thing in romance books where they have to hyperfocus on one of the man’s physical attributes and if it’s not the eyes it’s his fucking size. we get it. adam is big. HUGE. ENORMOUS. A FUCKING GIANT. HE HAS MUSCLES. I GET IT!!!!!! HIS FINGERS ARE MASSIVE AND SO IS HIS DICK. GREAT.you didn’t have to tell me in every paragraph though. i know i have shit memory but i am not close to dementia yet. once or twice would have been enough. like what do you want me to do? shall i applaud him? good job growing, i guess you ate your carrots as a kid, go you!have i mentioned that this book could have been 350 pages shorter if they had just talked to each other? communication, so important.this book started every chapter with a hypothesis except that most of them weren’t actually hopotheses but who cares. who cares. wait… my test theory prof is calling and i think he does.other than that, the science was actually the best part of the book. also the criticism of the bad working conditions of phd students was very well done. i’m only a master’s student but a phd might be in my future plans and i can already feel the poverty, so #relatable.there were only two chapters i liked: chapter 16 and chapter 20.small spoiler ahead.chapter 16 is the sex chapter and in chapter 20 a certain character gets called out on their behaviour and adam does this sexy thing of nearly beating them up.having read another review that has quoted chapter 16 though… ugh… cringe. idk what i was on reading this. in my defense i haven’t seen my boyfriend in a week so maybe i was feeling touch starved.also, there's this very fine line between finding your partner so sexy that you can't control yourself and premature ejaculation. i am not saying that adam belongs in the second category. but i am.i still stand by my opinion that chapter 20 was sexy.i did actually like adam even though he’s a very stereotypical grumpy-only-drinks-black-coffee-and-eats-broccoli kind of character. he is definitely kinda bland. but maybe i just like my men bland *shrugs*.i have like zero opinions on olive though. she was there i guess.all in all: i don’t think this book has done anything new or swoon worthy. the characters were average. the story was average. the writing was average. i don’t really get why everyone is so crazy about it. i guess the STEM aspect was fun but even that has been done before i think?overall, i was mainly bored and infuriated by the amount of unnecessary drama and height descriptions. you all do you i guess. but i’ll do me: 1.5 stars",1
1269,The Love Hypothesis,"Ah, scientists in love! Be still, my heart!Olive is a third year Ph.D. candidate, filling her pipettes and titrating like a boss, when she somehow manages to land herself in a fake relationship with the ever glowering Dr. Adam Carlsen. She really can't believe her bad luck. Unfortunately, she has spun her lies, so she has no choice but to see them through. But the more time they spend together, the more Olive starts to realize he might just be the one she's been looking for all along.This was just a hoot and a half! A lot of romcoms manage to get the romantic part exactly right, butThe Love Hypothesishits the comedy bit out of the park too. Olive's dialogues are witty and snarky, and she pretty much cracked me up from beginning to end. I couldn't stop giggling and snorting, even while reading in public, which definitely got me some weird looks from strangers.I absolutely loved that Ali Hazelwood chose a woman in STEM as her main character and highlighted the difficulties they encounter as part of this story. As a woman in STEM myself, it warms my heart to see someone like me take center stage in a romance. A lot of what Olive went through, including how intimidating it is to be in a field surrounded by men and how unsure she is of her worth and her ability, I understand intimately.The romance between Olive and Adam developed slowly, with plenty of tension and sizzle. The premise to set up the trope of fake dating was a little silly, but once you get past that, the rest is nothing short of sweet and satisfying. Adam is reticent in the beginning, but he soon thaws and warms up to Olive's relentless cheer and good-natured teasing. His support of her in their shared field is particularly touching and it made me root even harder for this couple.With romances, there's always the question of whether it contains explicit, open-door scenes. And whichever way the book chooses to go, it inevitably alienates half of the readership who wants it the other way. That's why I was particularly fond of the way it was handled in this book. All those scenes are in one contiguous chunk (spread across two chapters), so it's easy to skip if that's not your thing and you can still enjoy the rest of the story without having to worry about missing anything crucial.This story totally checks all the boxes for me. It's sweet, smart, and uproariously funny, and it touched my heart and my mind. No doubt about it, anything Ali Hazelwood writes from now on will be devoured by me posthaste.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Love on the BrainThe STEMinist NovellasUnder One RoofStuck with You~~~~~~~~~~~~This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

Look at the cover reminds us Reylo (Kylo and Rey disguised in lab coats, kissing each other till they get breathless), two nerdy adorable characters who were pretending as couple: a rigid-a.hole but also charismatic 34 years old professor and sweet, quirky, gold hearted Phd student who tries to find the cure of pancreatic cancer! I’m sold!!!Banters are nerdish, sexy, entertaining but I have to scream at hot professor Adam’s face at each time he calls Olive smart ass! I wish he may have called her something smarter, catchy, more affectionate maybe?Olive Smith is an orphan, insecure, hard working, smart biologist spending the most of her time in the lab for her research and emailing colleges for funding to work on the cure of cancer with brand new method.After losing her loved ones at young age she becomes insecure about relationships. She is happy with her research, spending time with her close friends. There’s nothing she cannot sacrifice for them.As soon as she breaks up with her boyfriend she doesn’t even like, she realizes her bestie Anh likes her ex way too much. To prove a point that she already moved on her life, she decides to kiss the first guy passing through the corridor while Anh is watching so she can believe in her and date with her ex.The plan was simple till the guy she randomly kissed turns out Adam Carlsen, a young, hotshot lab tyrant most of the students curse the day they met.But interestingly he doesn’t get furious about her love triangle tantrum. Actually he agrees to pretend acting like lovers for his own reasons to get enough fund to finance his own researches. Both of the parties seem like benefit from this arrangement till Olive realizes she likes way too much their Wednesday coffee dates and don’t forget the fact that she keeps drooling over his six packs. Even though he’s named as professor from hell, he always treats her sweet, respectful and he seems like he also enjoys to spend time with her.But Olive has to wear big girl pants to face with her true feelings even though her love is unrequited. Could she be brave enough to come clean with him? What if she has to risk at more than broken heart?Overall: I loved nerdish heroes and their gibberish scientific sweet talks! I enjoyed their chemistry!#metoomovement , emotional and physical abuse themes were sensitively added into equation.Holden and Malcolm were my favorite supporting characters.I loved the academic romcom premise!I went back and forth between four and five sisters but finally I rounded up 4.5 stars to 5 because of my love for MCs.

1271,The Love Hypothesis,"The Love Hypothesisis the kind of book that I think is better for newbie romance readers. For me, with thousands of romance books under my belt, it becamepainfulto read by the end.I started out readingThe Love Hypothesisfeeling giddy and elated. I*adored*the geeky, surly professor and poor grad student dynamic, and the narration byCallie Daltonwasbangin'. I was 100000% sure that I was going to love this book, and I started recommending it to everyone. But slowly, slowly, things starting creeping in.I will be the first to admit thatThe Love Hypothesisis an impressive debut fromAli Hazelwood. I'm impossibly excited to read her future work, but I dearly hope she changes a few things about how she crafts romance books for her second novel.This book is *excruciating* at times. The number of miscommunications and misunderstandings and deliberate withholding of information truly boggles the mind.With such a skilled narrator and such a great start to the book, you would think I would be riveted to the story, but by the end I had to speed up the narration a ton just to force myself to finish. I wanted to smack both characters in the head. Repeatedly.It is a huge pet peeve of mine when authors rely on miscommunications for the whole tension and plot of a book, and by 50% of the way in, it became abundantly clear that this is what we were facing. I was pretty upset that what had seemed so promising took such a sideways turn.Look, maybe you'll love this book and eat up every morsel, but I was actually angry by the end of this book.

1272,The Love Hypothesis,"once upon a time, i read this book, and despite the fact that i have a heart of darkness (sorry joseph conrad) and am full of hate and vitriol (makes me a fun gossip though) and eat romance novels for breakfast (as in am very picky about them - i'm actually not a big breakfast eater)...i enjoyed it.and then i read everything else that this author has ever written, and i hated all of it.and when to came time to revisit...well, welcome to judgment day.(updated review to come)---------------------original reviewExcuse me a moment. I just have to give myself a little pep talk. Won't take more than a paragraph or two.Okay, Emma. I know you - gag - felt...feelings during this book. I know you were invested in the romance in a way that you have rarely been invested in anything that can remotely be construed as warm and cozy and positive. Your most-watched movie is Spotlight and when you were at home alone for a week you spent it rewatching Mindhunter and You. Your heart is typically shale-esque, in hardness and brittleness and darkness.So I know that you're tempted to give five stars for the fact that it cracked your Grinchy shell and made your heart grow three sizes or whatever, but no.This is not a perfect book even though reading it was, like, a near-perfect experience.Even I, who thinks the miscommunication part of any romance is the best part due to the fact that is the most angsty and suffering-based, thought there were about 7 miscommunications too many here.And I could have used a bit more personality from our love interest. Maybe, I don't know, actually I take that back because men should leave being fun and characterized to women, who do it better.Okay. End pep talk because it isn't working.

1273,The Love Hypothesis,"it gave what it was supposed to give and 10x more!this shit is a literary masterpiece! flawless! perfection! excellent! splendid! and above all epic…these characters have bewitched me body, mind, soul! these bad bitch scientists had me acting all submissive and breedable 🛐Olive- pumpkin spice loving bad bitch was so inspiring and all around an enjoyable MC to read about. this book proves ANYONE (especially nerdy girls like me and olive) can girl boss, gate-keep, and gaslight!!she’s a bad bitch that deserves the world !!! but i’m also jealous of her because she has Adam !? like um sharing is caring #SelfishScientistanyways…Adam- this mfing dadddddy! had me screaming, clutching my pearls, and aggressively ripping my shirt off! i fucking love this strong, needle phobic, 6 foot something KING!! he’s a fucking thot y’all! don’t even fight me on this. he had my legs fucking divorced in chapter 16; his pov and Olive’sthe plot and writing were excellent! yes this is fiction but it’s written so realistically ya know? it ain’t fabricated. the emotions were raw. my heart was swelling for these characters. bruv why did i read this so MFing fast?!?! i don’t want it to be over.overall this book had me trembling, gasping for oxygen, sweating through my hairline, weak in the MFing knees, and pinned down to the ground.i had so much fun reading this. it had my attention from cover to cover! ain’t no one doing it out here like queen Ali Hazelwood!! Ali deserves the world for birthing this. She fucking DELIVERED 👏🏽 she deserves to get her kitty cat meow meow eaten out from the front to the back, up & down, side to side, in & around!! she deserves the world!!this is yet another book that hit me from the back, ate me out, and gave me a kiss on the forehead. let’s gooooooo 😈",5
1274,The Love Hypothesis,"**Spoiler Alert**The best part about this story is the focus on women in STEMeverything else is a blurry, one-dimensional mess that left me with way too many questions.1.What if Olive hadn't fake kissed Adam? Would he have continued to wait even more years before engaging with her?2.Olive kissing a random guy instead of properly communicating with her supposed 'best friend' is outlandish. Their motivation for keeping up the lies (and yes, they were both lying) was unconvincing.3.How did Olive go (within a span of 2 hours) from being a victim of sexual assault to joking about bad sushi and inconsequential things. That scene could have been so powerful yet it was poorly handled by Hazelwood.4.Anh, the 'best friend', is such a cliche character. Ugh5.Hazelwood threw in asexuality to tick a box, not because she wanted to actually write an asexual character. Olive trying to explain her sexuality while Adam was going down on her was one of the funniest non-funny scenes I've ever read. Like, girl, stfu.6.Finally, what exactly does Olive look like??!!! I knew she was 5'8"" and skinny. For that matter, I know more about Adam's henleys and plaid shirts than I do him.Overall, I was left feeling dissatisfied especially the fact that I didn't laugh even once. Isn't this meant to be a rom-com?",2
1275,The Love Hypothesis,It is IMPOSSIBLE and downright HORRIBLE for this book to get anything under a 5 star rating 💀ITS SOOOO FUCKING GOOD and I’m in such a hangover now i literally do not know what to do with myself.Start to finish HOLY SHIT. You’re hook line and sinker baby.Not one dry page here.Adam is one of the MOST WHOLESOME CHARACTERS IVE EVER READ Jesus Christ I’m so in love with this man. And OLIVE?!? My dedication to these two is downright unhealthy.I’ll ride hard for this book forever. It goes down as one of my top reads this year.SOOOO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS BOOK.The banter.The SPICE. Wait on chapter 16 JUST WAIT ON IT!!!The friendships.ADAM BEING SCARED OF NEEDLES.Olive wrangling out an ice cream sandwich from him.HIM LETTING HER!!WOMEN. IN. SCIENCE.I was a weeee bit scared that the science talk would confuse me because science is definitely not my strongest subject but easy peasy.I’m just obsessed. Rightfully so.This book is phenomenal and I REALLY REALLY need an Adam POV.That epilogue was amazing. The layout of the book is amazing.I’m thrilled about this. Holy crap. What else can I say to convince you…. absolutely top notch.,5
1276,The Love Hypothesis,"Re-read 10/12/21: Reached that point of fall when all I want to do is re-read my favorite romances and I am so!!!! happy to report that this one has joined the ranks. Adam and Olive are perfect I will be accepting zero (0) criticism at this timeOriginal read 7/1/21: I went into this one on a complete whim bc I needed an e-book to read on my nightly walk, and it ended up absolutely blowing me away. Everything about this was honestly perfect. The writing, the characters, the chemistry (literal and figurative lol), THE SMUT. This was SO hot, but also SO cute and SO funny and I just loved absolutely every second spent in between these pages. I didn't know who Ali Hazelwood was before going into this, but I will now be anxiously awaiting every book she will ever publish because this was JUST SO GOOD YOU ALL NEED TO READ IT / ADD IT TO YOUR TBRS IMMEDIATELY!

1277,The Love Hypothesis,"Hypothesis: Maybe I really am just a lonely bitch who only finds happiness in seeing fictional couples get their HEA? And that's okay? Just kidding lol, but also definitely not?I genuinely didn't think that I was going to enjoy this book as much as I did, especially with the obscene amount of hype it has received all over the internet....but DAMN was I wrong. The Love Hypothesis melted my stone cold heart and made me experience every single human emotion possible in 385 pages, so intensely that I have very few words to say about it that can be typed without keyboard smashing.If you need me, I'll be busy sitting in the corner physically restraining myself from rereading this book & weeping over the fact that fictional love is fictional (asjkfgsdjakls).",5
1278,The Love Hypothesis,"The first 1/3 was tough for me to get through because I found the multiple forced PDA scenes mortifying + I’m not into professor/student romances and had to get over that (even though she’s a grad student and they don’t work together) + the protagonist generally acting embarrassing (girl please be more professional!!). However, chapter 12 onwards was smoother sailing and when we got to the good stuff: juicy misunderstandings, hurt/comfort, smut, a big protective dude, etc. The book definitely requires suspending my disbeliefs, but I enjoyed squeeing at the romance once I could fully get into it.",4
1279,The Love Hypothesis,"for a book about science there was some dubious physics at play (see:hero fitting heroine’s entire boob in mouth)this was cute though. heroine did irritate me at times but i’m a curmudgeon when it comes to quirky heroines. she did stand up for herself in the end though and despite the aforementioned whole boob snafu, the sex was 🔥",4

1287,The Love Hypothesis,"– 4.5 starsI heard this book started out as a Wattpad story and people weren't impressed with the writing, but honestly I'd take that as a back-handed compliment. Have you read therightWattpad stories? Some of them are masterpieces and no, I don't take criticism. And no, I'm not talking aboutAftereither 😌The Love Hypothesis will go down as the biggest surprise of this year and no one is more surprise than me. This book has been EVERYWHERE I go. I couldn't outrun this book, even if I wanted to. And you know with hype comes great expectations. And with great expectations comes even greater disappointments. Therefore, I made it my mission to go into TLH expecting nothing and received everything.I've read the prologue and I WAS HOOKED!!!When do you ever stumble into a stranger's bathroom blinded, because you're wearing lenses that has been expired for years and said stranger is going to be your biggest motivator for the years to come?Olive and Adam's meet-cute already had me on a chokehold.""It's fine."" She waved a hand. She'd have rolled her eyes, if they hadn't been on fire. ""The burning usually lasts only a few minues.""""You mean you've done this before?""She frowned. ""Done what?""""Put in expired contacts.""""Of course. Contacts are not cheap.""""Neither are eyes.""Followed, the story was brimmed with so many rom-com tropes. SO MANY. Maybe Ali Hazelwood tried a little bit too much to bring all of these tropes in one story and maybe it was a bit too much. Personally, I didn't mind it, cause every Olive x Adam interaction just made me smile like a fool. But here is a list of all the tropes, you can expect when reading The Love Hypothesis:💫 age gap (Olive, 26 & Adam, 34)💫 sunshine-grumpy💫 fake-dating💫 slow-burn💫 workplace romance💫 Ph.D student x professor (but it's not forbidden)💫 mutual pining💫 friends-to-lovers also known as dumbasses-to-lovers💫 one-bed trope (kinda)💫 Hero sees heroine in his clothes and is can't talk for a second💫 guy simping for the girl first💫 dimples💫 asshole-ish Hero who is only soft for his girl💫 endless banter and teasing""Come on. Maybe we're lucky and the chair will spot us. And I'll buy you an ice cream sandwich afterward.""""Will I be paying for this ice-cream sandwich?"" He sounded resigned now.""Likely. Actually, scratch that, you probably don't like ice cream anyawy, because you don't enjoy anything that's good in life."" She kept on walking, pensively chewing on her lower lip. ""Maybe the cafeteria has some raw broccoli?""""I don't deserve this verbal abuse on top of the flu shot.I'll spare the subpar summary of this book, cause y'all can read the blurb for yourself and jump right into everything else 😂｡･ﾟﾟ･The Romance･ﾟﾟ･｡Just look at the list above. It literally has all of my favorite tropes in one book. From the first interaction between Adam and Olive I was clued to the pages. I love their easy banter with each other. Olive teasing him about his age. Adam's hate about everything sugary (but especially Pumpkin Spice Latte).""Are you going to be less harsh, then?""""Unlikely.""She sighed. ""You know, when I have no more friends and everyone hates me because of this fake-dating thing, I'll be super lonely and you are going to have to hang out with me every day. I'll annoy you all the time. Is it really worth being mean to every grad in the program?""""Absolutely.""Adam is notoriously known as the campus asshole professor who makes every grad student piss their pants. He's super strict when it comes to research and calls his student out on their bullshit when someone is not good enough. But when it comes to Olive, he is a soft harmless kitten. He believes in her so much. Adam always encourages and praises Olive for her brilliant work. Adam Carlsen is Olive's #1 fan.""I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.""Women in STEM are underrepresentated and it was refreshing to see Olive being one of the few women working there and making a difference with her research on pancreatic cancer. It was interesting to read Olive's frustrating with being a grad student.. all the struggles and insecurites that come with it. All these priviliged white men that think they are some hot shot, but doing the bare minimum work.Olive's smart, a great friend, but you know when I fell in love with her? When Olive and Adam went on their first fake coffee date and Adam offered to pay for her coffee, cuz he knows she's a poor student and what does that girl do? Adds chocolate chip cookie, a banana and a pack of gum to her coffee 😂😂😂 the audacity lmao yes girl get that luxury package lunch 😂""You're so big."" He groaned into her neck. His entire body was vibrating with tension.""You can take it.""The Love Hypothesis was very low on the heat level, but that one sex scene we got. I looooved it 🥵🥵🥵 Every time a Hero has such a big dick that the heroine doesn't know if she can take it and he assures her that she can I'M SCREaMINg 🥵🥵🥵 When Adam tells her that he wants to go down on her until she passes out 🥵🥵🥵🥵 When Adam asked Olive if he can fuck her... I'm on my knees for my consent king 🛐🥵Adam Carlsen, ik hou van jou 🛐🛐🛐Adam: My arm hurtsOlive: From the flu shot?Adam: It's really painful.Olive: Oh, Adam. I'm so sorry.Olive: Should I come over and kiss it better?Adam: You never said it would hurt so bad.Olive: As someone once told me, it's not my job to work on your emotin regulation skills.Adam: 🖕｡･ﾟﾟ･The Friendship between Olive and Anh･ﾟﾟ･｡Anh is Vietnamese and I never see Viet rep in romance book so ofc I'm going to love this girl. Not biased or anything. Anh was a queen anyway and it wasn't hard to stan her 💅""No matter how many pounds of spoiled shrimp cocktail you projectile vomit, you can trust me. We're a team, you and I. And Malcolm, when he's not busy screwing his way though the Stanford population. So if Carlsen is secretly an extraterrestrial life-form planning a takover of Earth that will ultimately result in humanity being enslaved by evil overlords who look like cicadas, and the only way to stop him is dating him, you can tell me and I'll inform NASA–""Find yourself a best friend who would marry you if she thinks you will get deported back to Canada and need a green card. 🥺You don't understand how much I love Anh. She was probably my favorite characters from this whole book (no offense to Olive and Adam, cause I love them a lot).My love for her already started that she didn't want to date Jeremy, because Olive dated him and gave her approval. This girl knows the girl code too well and it's for her that Olive had to come up with this ridicilous idea of kissing the first guy she sees in the hallway to convince Anh that she's over Jeremy, so these two can get it on. But then, Anh is also the best wingwoman without knowing. All of her demands for Olive and Adam to show their PDA (Olive using Adam has her chair ✔️ Olive putting sunscreen on a half naked Adam ✔️ Olive kissing Adam ✔️) The list of sexual harassment Adam could compile, I'd love to see it. 😇｡･ﾟﾟ･The Side-Characters･ﾟﾟ･｡The rest of the secondary characters like Holden and Malcolm were awesome too. I love Adam and Holden's friendship. How Holden tries to embarass Adam and Adam pretending to be annoyed and tolerating him even tho their bromance is more than solid. Most of all Holden has Adam's back.""I have access to your Google Calender, asshole. You're not busy. If you don't want to hang out with me, you can just be honest.""""I don't want to hang out with you.""""You little shit. After the wee we just had. And on my birthday.""Adam recoiled slightly. ""What? It's not your birthday.""""Yes, it is.""""Your birthday is April tenth.""""Is it, though?""Adam closed his eyes, scratching his forehead. ""Holden, we've talked daily for the past twenty-five years, and I have been to at least five Power Rangers-themed birthday parties of yours. The last one was when you turned seventeen. I know when your birthday is.""""You always had it wrong, I was just too nice to tell you.""Malcolm and Olive had a cute friendship too. Loved how Malcolm was so support of Olive's feeling for Adam even tho he didn't like him. Malcolm with Anh probably the only characters with some brain cells. He gave Olive some good dating advise, but did she listen noooo.｡･ﾟﾟ･A Book not without its faults･ﾟﾟ･｡Like the clown that I am, I really thought this book might be a 5 star read after only reading the prologue lmao that's how much I loved Olive and Adam's first meeting 😂 But of course I jinxed myself, cause there were a couple of things that I annoyed me.I call this book dumbasses-to-lovers for a reason. Olive and Adam had clearly feelings for each other, but were too chicken shit to confess them. Olive had confessed to Malcolm that she was falling in love w Adam and Adam heard it and when Olive said she was talking about someone else, that dumbass really believed her. I mean it makes for good angst for exacly 3 seconds cause I could feel my boy's pain, but how could he not known it was him all along. Same with Olive and her thinking the ""amazing girl"" Adam was pining for all these year was some random women in his faculty like 😭😭😭 guys I thought you were SMART 😭And that ending was so unsatisfying. I hate it when a romance doesn't have a proper love confession scene. I know Adam loves Olive and he told it to other, but we never got his ""I love you"" that he said to Olive. There was her confession and then it was cut right to the epilogue that wasn't all that satisfying either..｡･ﾟﾟ･Conclusion･ﾟﾟ･｡Should I study for an exam that I have tmrr and instead have read this book? Yes. (1)Will I fail said exam because of this book? Also yes. (2)Will I blame Ali Hazelwood and fictional characters for my inability to manage my life? Y-E-S. (3)Would I do it all over again? See answers (1) to (3)No regrets, I love Olive and Adam so much and The Love Hypothesis will be in my favorite books I've read this year. ♥️P.S. this book taught me to carry myself with the confidence of a medicore white man if I wanna reach my goal and I'll always remember that. I'll go into the exam with that mentality, I'm suing if I'm still going to fail 😌",4

1289,The Love Hypothesis,"***TODAS LAS ESTRELLAS DEL UNIVERSO***”I’m going to kill you. If you say another word about the woman I love, if you look at her, if you even think about her, I’m going to fucking kill you”.Este libro es uno de los más bonitos que he leído en mucho tiempo. ¿Saben de esos libros que, cuando los leen, de verdad los hacen volver a creer en el amor? Pues, por muy cursi que suene, eso fueThe Love Hypothesispara mí. Sí, leo un montón de libros de fantasía romántica que tienen unos ideales del amor espectaculares, pero a la vez se sienten tremendamente inalcanzables. PeroThe Love Hypothesises una historia de amor entre dos personas que no son perfectas, que comenten muchísimos errores, que tienen miedo de dejar sus sentimientos al alcance de cualquiera y que, sobre todo, se sienten muy, muy reales.Aquí nos encontramos con Olive, una científica que está intentando encontrar fondos para su investigación sobre un tipo de cáncer y, al mismo tiempo, está tratando de que su mejor amiga se anime a salir con un chico que le encanta, pero que resulta que es su ex. Para impulsarla, Olive decide que su amiga debe verla feliz con un hombre, pero el problema es que su vida amorosa está más desolada que el desierto del Sahara. Sin embargo, un día, en un impulso y aprovechando que su amiga la está viendo, Olive se lanza a besar a uno de los profesores del departamento… que resulta ser nada más y nada menos que Adam Carlsen, a quien básicamente todo el mundo teme porque es frío y despiadado con los estudiantes. La cosa es que, contra todo pronóstico, Olive y Adam terminan entrando en un acuerdo defake dating, cada uno con sus propios motivos, pero todos sabemos cómo acaba esto.Si me conocen, saben que a veces suelo ser supremamente impaciente con los libros que tienen romancesslowburn… yThe Love Hypothesises la definición de eso. Sin embargo, les juro que no había disfrutado tantísimo un libro en mucho tiempo. Toda la historia de Olive y Adam, la tensión que se fue desarrollando con cada encuentro incómodo, con cada situación loca en la que se metían, con cada malentendido, con cada escena en la que se notaba que ambos tenían un poco oxidados sus capacidades de relacionarse con otros seres humanos, con cada pequeña sonrisa que Olive le sacaba a Adam, con los chistes internos que empezaron a aparecer, con las miradas, con la angustia, con el miedo de estar enamorándose del otro y quizás no ser correspondido… wow, todo eso fue como una flecha que se me iba clavando cada vez más hondo en el corazón, que me recordaba eternamente mi desgraciada soltería y que me hacía quererlos a ellos cada vez más. Es absolutamente demente lo mucho que uno puede llegar a involucrarse emocionalmente con dos personas que ni siquiera existen. Pero esa es la magia de los libros, supongo.Y sí, hubo momentos frustrantes en los que quería golpearlos a los dos y encerrarlos en una habitación para que dejaran de pensar cosas idiotas y, por fin, aceptaran que estaban locos el uno por el otro… En serio, hay momentos en los que me sacaban de quicio. Pero al mismo tiempo todo era hermoso y parte de sus procesos. Sobre todo con respecto a Olive. Y me gustaría muchísimo hablar de un aspecto de ella con el que me identifiqué a niveles estratosféricos, pero eso sería unspoiler, así que dejaré que lo descubran ustedes cuando lean el libro.¿Y el final? ¿Qué puedo decirles? Esos últimos capítulos son perfectos, increíbles,spicy, llenos de sentimientos, de más malentendidos, de momentos épicos y, sobre todo, de muchísima, muchísima felicidad. No les puedo decir mucho más, pero sepan queThe Love Hypothesises uno de esos libros que, aunque te pueden frustrar por momentos y que pueden tener escenas tristes, siempre van a quedar como unhighlightde felicidad en tu memoria.",5
1290,The Love Hypothesis,"edit: 1 star.The reason? Oh, well, I didn't enjoy this book whenever I think of it. And it makes me anxious to think that I rated it with 3 stars, lmao... After this, I might be able to rest in peace, knowing that I rated as I thought when I first finished it. Straight to ""big hype, big lie"" shelf. :D“He’d clearly never seen a rom-com or read a romance novel in his life.”Buckle up, bitches, there are some spoilers ahead!I honestly haven't read a lot books with ""miss sunshine and mister grumpy"" trope, but I kind of know how the thing goes, so yikes.For what I know, this book was a Reylo fanfic, so picturing Adam as Adam Driver wasn't complicated. But it made it hard for me because. . . Idk, it's not that I think he's ugly, but I don't think either that he's sexy. If you find him attractive and that stuff, then you know your reasons.I've seen a LOT —y'all know that I don't lie with this— of hype for this book. *looks at booktok, booktwt, bookstagram* So, I had to give it a try. . . Every single day appears on my feed at least 6 times in a row friends' updates of this book, so, I thought ""this book must be good"".Anyhow, I don't actually know how to feel about this book. . . It was. . . weird? Sweet? Awkward? Immature?Idk, you name it.I'm fan of nerd and smart people who're not smug, arrogant and assholes. Actually, there's more probability that I fall in love with some nerd (I'm not straight, so, lol) like Adam or Olive than for someone like Tom (he was hot, but he was such a fucking dick).I hadZEROexpectations from this book because lately ""great"" and overhyped books tend to disappoint me to the point of not wanting to have high hopes (don't start with the ""then why do you read them?"" because I'm not a nice person when it comes to insult people, lmao) aND YET, HERE I AM, WRITING THE REVIEW OF THIS BOOK.I need to check up on my life choices. . . Which makes me go to the thing that drove me mad in this book: eVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME OLIVE WAS LIKE ""YES, THIS IS MY LIFE BECAUSE OF MY DECISIONS"", YES, SIS, WE GET IT. YOU'VE MADE SOME SILLY AND POOR DECISIONS, BUT BUCKLE UP, AND MOVE THE FUCK ON.Also, I was so fucking tired of the“carry yourself with the confidence of a mediocre white man”Yes, we get it, white men are mediocre. Most of them are. I just don't know why, but that phrase pissed me off.Chapter 16 was so hyped. Bitch, no. It was awkward and it seemed very very very forced. It is mentioned (briefly, but there it is) that Olive might be asexual, which is fine and I don't judge that because I am ace and I totally get how it feels. Nevertheless, I did think that was forced:Iperceived her uncomfortable doing that, despite the fact that she agreed. I honestly don't know how sex works, lol. Totally unnecessary. I get the hype for some things, but not for chapter 16. It wasn't spicy in any single way. It made me feel uncomfortable and I was cringing every 10 seconds. I thought that something good was gonna happen, and I was left with empty hands because I received nothing from that chapter.Idk why, but Olive seemed VERY immature and Adam was flat? Yes, Mr. Grumpy and-I-hate-everything-black-is-my-color-because-black-is-my-soul-and-I-make-my-grades-cry. I get the trope, I really do, but give him some personality???Adam it's perceived as someone complicated and who loves their own personal space (again, I don't judge because I enjoy my own personal space as no one) and Olive describes him as ""antagonic and unapproachable"" aLL THE TIME. If people told me that, I'd take it as a joke, but deep down that shit hurts, even as a joke or random comment, but, yeah, us, grumpy people, are like that. I get that Adam is huge, that have big ass hands, big body, big shoulders and big dick. wE GET IT. Just please stop repeating it every damn time the damn man appears.Sometimes, I disliked Anh. I didn't know if she was around 26 or 15. She basically forced Olive to do things that obviously she didn't wanna do, despite the fact that Anh thought that Olive and Adam were dating and she didn't know the whole truth. She was very flat and at the very end we didn't have a lot of her.After the big disappointing that chapter 16 turned out to be, I was even more disappointed than ever. I mean, as I said: I had very little —if none at this point— expectations, but chapter 16 made it go from 0.01 to -00000000000000000000 in a span of 5 minutes, and I didn't wanna read anymore.When Adam said, and I quote:""If you say another word about the woman I love...""I lost my shit. I was fucking melting and no, I am not ashamed of it, lol.The romance was okay I guess??? I don't know why, but I expected more. Please don't ask me why, because even I don't know the answer to that... Perhaps it was all of the hype on booktok and bookstagram, but it was a flop to me, lmao.Overall I guess it was fine? Idk dude, writing this review made me realize that I didn't like this book as much as I wanted.Tho I'd fake-date / fake-marry someone to get out of Latin America (third world country issues, lol) and get the citizenship in another country, perhaps Europe or Canada? Idk, love can come with time, lol.Tom was an asshole and I wish Adam would have punch him in the face :)In overall, as I didn't enjoy a lot of romance (or think that actually was romantic, cute and that stuff) makes me think that I'm a heartless and cold bitch who can't feel a single thing or will never fall in love. bUT I'M ALSO A HOPELESS ROMANTIC. I NEED HELP.previous review:The only way I'm gonna live a rom-com story is gonna be when I fake-date or fake-marry someone to get mi citizenship in another country",1
1291,The Love Hypothesis,"Olive plants a giant kiss on a random person in the hallway. Her friend, Anh, has a crush on a guy that Olive went out with one time, and she wants to convince Anh that she is free to go after her one-date wonder. However, the random guy in the hallway turns out to be a world famous scientist and a very grumpy, mean one at that. He is the famous Adam Carlsen. Will Olive and Adam be able to convince everyone that they are a couple? Will they discover any real feelings? Plus, Olive is about to graduate....As far as romance novels go, this one was pretty sweet and funny. It was also a quick read. Although I do wish that Adam wasn't always described as essentially an underwear model. Isn't it enough just to be ridiculously smart with a decent job? Do you have to have six-pack abs too? Setting expectations a little high? This might have alienated some readers but if Adam and Olive are both scientists, why don't they have more scientific discussions? I'm not a very scientific person, but I would assume that it would be like two literary buffs quoting book phrases to each other.Overall, this was an enjoyable book with some quality plot development.

1294,The Love Hypothesis,"""Ik hou van jou, Adam."" That pretty much sums up my thoughts on this book🥺🥰The hype is justified. This was such a PERFECT book. I'm so in love with it. Damn, why did I not read this sooner 😩 Although I gotta say that epilogue was totally rushed.Oliva and Adam make such a cute couple. I'll fight to protect them. I was for real giggling, blushing, smiling, jumping and laughing throughout my read.To those who haven't yet read this- DO READ! You're missing out on something so beautiful and exceptional. Highly recommend!!",5
1295,The Love Hypothesis,"“I've never been surer of anything. Except maybe cell theory.”the love hypothesisis the best romance i've read in years. it's smart, funny, and oh so swoon worthy! and it was truly one of those books that reminded me why i love reading. i fell in love with both olive and adam so quickly, but i also found this to be one of the most believable fake dating romances, too. from the very first page, i was absolutely hooked and only felt more and more endeared throughout! (and even more late into the night when i desperately wassigning up for the author's newsletterso i could unhingedly get an adam pov bonus chapter!)this book deals with some heavy themes at times, so please use caution and i'll list some warnings below. i personally felt like the author does a thoughtful and important job at highlight what women of stem can face in many lab settings, while also always shining light on how much more noninclusive (and scary) that it can be for bipoc women and nonbinary people of stem. (the author note at the end with some resources was really amazing, too)i just appreciated so much of this book and this author's words. this story was a little niche to me and my personal life, so i think that also helped me fall in love!

So many red flags appear in your vision as you keep flipping the pages. At the second half, things get escalated! You barely hold your screams as more tragic events follow each other. It’s like listening to a concerto slowly raises its tempo and as you reach the ending, you hear the crescendo: that’s moment the earth shattering revelation squeezes your heart, you barely breathe!I have so many words for the ending that are not enough to express my feelings.

1297,None of This Is True,I don't know how to feel about this 😵‍💫 (but I did binge it in one sitting),4
1298,None of This Is True,"4 1/2 stars. I want to start by saying:this was absolutely riveting. I inhaled this book. The only way the pages could have turned faster is if I had more hours in my day.The reason I am not givingNone of This Is Truefive stars, which I thought I would for 95% of the book, is that I feel conflicted about the ending. Maybe it is because I have certain expectations from Jewell at this point, and the ending here didn't fit with them... I just know that I wanted more from the final chapters. In a way, it felt unfinished. Could there be a sequel lined up?But back to me gushing about the stuff I loved because this is a cracktastic ride.Jewell throws together two women-- birthday twins, born on the same day in the same hospital -- from very different backgrounds. Alix Summer, with her seemingly perfect life as a podcaster and her seemingly perfect family in their beautiful house, and Josie, a woman from a council estate with a past filled with abuse, grooming and who-knows-what other horrors.When Josie proposes she be a guest on Alix's podcast to tell the story of her life, Alix is curious about this strange woman. Josie lets Alix into her life and history through the podcast and Alix, in turn, gradually lets Josie into her life too. But the more Alix comes to know Josie and her past, the more she worries she's made a terrible mistake.Lots of short, punchy chapters, interspersed with a Netflix documentary and podcast extracts, all make for a very fast-paced read. You know bad shit has happened from the start, maybereeeaaaaallllybad shit, but I didn't have a clue what, exactly, had gone down, and I was desperate to find out.Alix's life is nowhere near as shiny as it appears on the surface and Josie is just a fascinating character. Peeling apart the layers of her backstory, discovering her childhood, her role as a mother, and the lies she has told, was pure heart-pounding fun!The wait for Jewell's next book will be too long.",4
1299,None of This Is True,"Trust Your InstinctsNone of This is Trueis a psychological thriller about two women who, through a chance encounter, learn they are birthday twins. Their unlikely meeting turns into a podcast in which shared confidences become the motive for murder.Meet Josie Fair, a 45-year-old part-time seamstress. Married to a man significantly older, she has decided to change the course of her life in her 45th year. Alix comes into her life at just the right time--a podcast host, she is the perfect woman to help Josie share her intriguing story. Alix and Josie’s lives become intertwined in more ways than one, culminating in a chilling crime.Chapters alternate between Josie and Alix.Josie is alluring, but she is also intense and odd. She is off-putting but enthralling at the same time.Her story is questionable, and I was waffling back and forth while reading this on her reliability. Alix’s chapters are not as interesting as Josie’s, but she adds a level of stability to the story.Interspersed between chapters are interviews filmed for a Netflix series called “The Birthday Twin.” These tidbits add another layer to the events, but the snippets don’t show the whole of the situation until the end when the truth is finally revealed.This is an addictive page-turner that I couldn’t put down. Josie is a train wreck of a character that I couldn’t look away from. Her character is one of the reasons I enjoyed this novel. At the same time, themes include pedophilia, alcoholism, and physical and emotional abuse, so it is not a fun read. It is also dark, tense, suspenseful, and has some major creepy vibes. The ending gave me the chills.I haven’t loved Jewell’s most recent novels, but this one is back to form.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Atria Books in exchange for an honest review.",4
1300,None of This Is True,"It took me awhile to sort out my thoughts on this one, as it was not quite what I expected, but that isn’t a bad thing. I buddy read this with my sister Irina, and part of the reason I love reading the same book as a friend or friends is due to the fact that you can really hash out your book review content ahead of time. We both ended up with similar feelings onNone of This Is True, and foremost agreed that it was a compulsive, must read suspense tale.Lisa Jewell is an incredibly talented storyteller, as she can really take the odd day-to-day occurrences and entwine them with clear and concise character development, giving birth to novels that allow the reader to fully engage with the cast of characters, no matter if they are likable or despicable. This book is no different, and the multiple povs really give us insight into the various narrators inner thoughts and feelings while the tension ramps up around them. Josie and Alix couldn’t be more different; they come from different lifestyles and circumstances, and yet… Could they be more similar than originally meets the eye?No spoilers, but there are some heavy themes discussed here. In fact, the build up of 85% of the novel is such a beautiful master class on slow burning suspense, and how to do it so that you don’t lose the reader in the process, that I was sure this would be Jewell’s darkest novel yet. The final 15% is what threw me for a loop. There are a few aspects that I had to overlook up until this point, behaviors and lack of affirmative action in the characters that I don’t think would play out the way it did in the book in real life, but understandably needed to be done to progress this particular story.However, my reason for not giving this a full 5 stars is that this final 15% felt as if it just lost steam and wasn’t sure of how it wanted to end, so it took a milder finale that had me feeling a little deflated, going from full speed ahead to a little bit of, “Wait, that’s it?” I believe the ending was designed to give the reader some authority over how they perceived not only the entire story, but also what happens after the final page is turned, although I would have been more satisfied with full closure.That said, this game of cat and mouse was such a deviously delightful read that I can’t help but highly recommend it for your 2022 TBR. While not my favorite Lisa Jewell novel, it is an immensely enjoyable read that will be a fantastic book club choice, brimming with copious discussion material.*Many thanks to the publisher for my review copy.",4
1301,None of This Is True,"Lisa Jewell's latest Psychological Thriller grabbed my attention from the start and held it all the way through. This was absolutely addictive!!When I first heard about this, I could hardly believe it. A story that follows two women turning forty-five, and I am turning forty-five this year. It can't be coincidence...I just knew I was going to love it and per usual, I was right. Not only did I love it, I freaking loved it. This will definitely be on myFavorites of the Yearlist.An added treat was Buddy Reading it with my beautiful niece, Lyss. I definitely recommend it for Buddy Reads or Book Clubs. There's a lot to discuss.This story follows two women, Alix Summers, a popular podcaster, and Josie Fair, an unassuming woman, whose profession is so inconsequential, I can't recall it.Alix and Josie bump into each other for the first time in the bathroom of a local pub, coincidentally on the day they were both turning 45. They were birthday twins!Shortly after, they bump into each other again outside of the school that Alix's children currently attend, and Josie's attended years ago.As they are chatting, Josie, who has listened to Alix's podcast, pitches an idea to her. Alix should do a podcast focusing on Josie's life.Josie tells Alix that she is on the brink of making some very drastic changes and she'd like Alix to document the process.Even though Alix finds Josie's vibe unsettling, she admits there's something fascinating about her. She is intrigued.Unable to resist temptation to dig into Josie's life, Alix accepts her offer and begins to record the podcast, inviting Josie to her home studio for interview sessions.From that point on, the women's lives become entangled. It doesn't take long for Alix to suspect that Josie is so much more than she initially appeared. Josie is a smart woman, who happens to be hiding some very dark secrets.Josie infiltrates Alix's life so deeply, she eventually ends up living at her house. Alix hardly knows how any of this happened and then suddenly, Josie's gone. That's when Alix's real nightmare begins.I was completely swept up in the lives of these two women. I loved the back and forth, learning about their past and present circumstances. Their dynamic, as well, was fascinating.Right off the bat, I was intrigued and I felt like I was being misdirected in some way. The path the story took, I was never quite sure who I could trust.As the story progresses, it's like a veil being pulled from your eyes, but I still couldn't believe what I was reading. It was so twisted!I absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast-paced and tense Psychological Thrillers. Bonus points if you have enjoyed Jewell's work in the past, or love stories that incorporate a podcast, or true crime, element.For the record, I thought Jewell nailed the podcast turned True Crime documentary angle. Additionally, her use of mixed media, with the sections from the Netflix series, was amazingly well done; round of applause.Thank you so much to the publisher, Atria Books, for providing me with a copy to read and review. This was an absolute blast to read. I cannot wait to pick up more from this author!",5
1302,None of This Is True,"Compared to Jewell's previous few books, I liked this one quite a bit better. Most of it anyway.None of This Is True--but what is true and what isn't? That's the question I was asking myself throughout my reading.Josie and her husband are celebrating Josie's 45th birthday in a pub. At a table nearby, podcaster Alix is also celebrating her 45th birthday. Josie has a quiet, reserved, different type of life, and Alix seems to have everything Josie wants. The two meet and discover that they are ""birthday twins"" and this eventually involves Alix interviewing Josie for her podcast. Josie tells the tale of her life and Alix is shocked. But what is true? Is any of it?Jewell's writing is strong and I was thoroughly invested. I could not stand Josie, but that was totally the point. The ending is interesting and really got me thinking. My recommendation is to just go into the reading of this book with an open mind and without any preconceived notions as to what you think is going on, because that will probably change many times throughout.There were a few holes in the narrative and a few times that I thought the story could have been a bit tighter and less repetitive. However in the end I was able to overlook those factors and just go with it.And you have to be ready to set aside that a 13-15 year old CHILD cannot consent to a relationship regardless of how whackadoodle sociopathic she is. She just can't. And if Walter was turned on by that, then ew. If I had my MSW daughter read this she would say Josie's actions throughout the book all stemmed from that unresolved trauma and she wouldn't be wrong.Decent psychological suspense story that will provide a wild ride, so buckle up!I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.",3
1303,None of This Is True,"4 depraved, twisty, dark, and disturbing stars✨✨✨✨. One star blacked out because of the ending.I am a huge fan of Lisa Jewell, and this was right up there in terms of thrill, fast pace, plot, writing style and characterisation – yes but that doesn’t mean I liked the characters. Josie in particular was detestable.The PlotAs the birthday celebrations get underway, a chance encounter between Josie and Alix reveals they not only share the same birth date, but they were also born in the same hospital, on the same day, and went to the same school. Except one is psychotic, a murderer, and a serial abuser.It doesn't end there, these two women seemingly share frustrations with each of their respective partners. Alix, whose husband, Nathan, is a binge drinker and frequently fails to come home, and Walter whose age gap has become even more noticeable to his much younger wife. Although she feels ‘groomed’ and controlled from the age of sixteen. A storyline which makes this difficult to endure in some parts, but they are real life issues so of course we should cover them.Alix is convinced by Josie to make her the subject and storyline of her next podcast which reaches out to thousands of women suffering domestic and psychological abuse, and women who enjoy hearing other life stories. What is to happen here though, changing format is the story has not yet completed. Its real time crime!!!.Review and CommentsThis story had me gripped throughout but I feel the ending let the book down a little. It was too contrived, and I failed to appreciate what drove this woman to do the things she did. I also enjoy more analysis when taking on difficult subjects and wanted a better ending for Roxy and Erin. The story behind Walter was left vague for me and didn’t conclude on the various aspects of his life and actions. Did he marry a much younger girl or was he guilty of ‘grooming’ her??. I settled on the former in the absence of any more detail. Even that was weird though.The ending did not spoil the book - it's just it could have been better. I would like to have seen the threads tied up nicely or differently, and then this would have been a clear 5 star book.However, for the plot as a whole this was excellent and whilst not entirely surprising, it was unpredictable which maintained the tension in the story. To have disliked some of the characters so much means Lisa Jewell did her job well. The suspense was palatable, the sense of danger and thrill was accretive and penetrating. The themes were well chosen. The underlying messages are great although some could have been fleshed out more, and the writing style just works a treat for me.I read this in day which I am deliberately not doing any more, because this was such a captivating read and a great book overall.A thrilling thriller, a chilling reminder to pick your friends carefully, and an immersive read that should keep you hooked.",4
1304,None of This Is True,"Trigger warning: abuseI’ve seen mixed reviews for this book, but overall I enjoyed it. It is dark, and some have fairly remarked on how the matter of child abuse was treated. I don’t want to get into that, although I get why this is a sensitive topic. Despite the book being about dark topics, it read as a thriller and I liked the podcast angle. For some reason I like the twisted minds of someone with their own agenda, and the anticipation of what will happen next. You know something isn’t quite right, there are red herrings making feel uncomfortable inside, but you want to dive into the murky water to see the creatures lurking there. After all, isn’t that why we love unrealistic horror movies, because we can watch but still feel detached from it all? This isn’t a pleasant read, and it can easily become too much, but the exploration of themes like obsession, manipulation and warped mindsets did appeal to me.I think it’s best to make up one’s own opinion on this one, I get why some might feel uncomfortable, angry and frustrated by how some themes are handled.",4
1305,None of This Is True,"Alix Summer has a successful podcast that features women who have overcome extreme difficulties and hardship, to lead happy and successful lives.Alix herself has a pretty good life too - a smart ultra modern home in London, two beautiful children, a husband that she loves - you get the picture, life’s pretty good in the main, although her husband Nathan does have a tendency to go on benders from time to time, which Alix finds worrying.Whilst celebrating her 45th birthday at the local pub with family and friends, Alix is approached by a woman in the restroom who introduces herself as Josie Fair and tells her that they’re ‘birthday twins’ as it’s her 45th birthday too.A few days later Josie approaches Alix as she’s waiting to pick her children up outside school, and says she’s been listening to her podcasts, and wants to know if Alix will feature her, not as a successful woman, but as a woman who has some dark secrets but is about to change her life completely.After much debating, Alix thinks she would make an interesting subject so she decides to give it a go. Bad choice! As Josie slowly integrates herself into Alix’s life, into her very home, she’ll discover that Josie isn’t exactly who she portrays herself to be.As the podcast continues, some very disturbing facts begin to reveal themselves, and Alix realises that she’s made a big mistake!There’s lots of tension, some great twists, together with some very dark and complex characters, as Ms Jewell expertly peels back the layers with consummate skill to reveal an intricate and twisted tale that’s such a worthy read.*Thank you to Netgalley and Random House UK, Cornerstone, Century for an ARC in exchange for an honest unbiased review",4
1306,None of This Is True,"Could. Not. Put. It. Down. Very few books cause me to wake up at 2:00 am to finish reading. This heart-pounding, gripping thriller opens with two women celebrating their forty-fifth birthday at the same pub. They meet in the loo and learn they were born on the same day in the same hospital.One of the women is a podcaster and the small piece of information about being birthday twins starts a relationship that is faster than a runaway locomotive. While reading the book, I felt like the emoji that has both hands over their eyes but with their fingers spread so that the upcoming train wreck is slightly visible.Highly, highly recommend! Buckle up for the ride!",5
1307,None of This Is True,"4.5 rounded upJosie Fair and her much older husband Walter go to a gastropub to celebrate her 45th birthday. It’s not their usual style but hey, why not once in a while! In walks a blonde, well dressed, attractive ‘Birthday Queen’ and this proves to be podcaster Alix Summer with a big crowd including husband Nathan. It’s quiet and reserved versus noisy and effervescent energy, the proverbial chalk and cheese. Josie is mesmerised and fascinated and then she realises that Alix too is 45 today, they really are birthday twins! When Alix leaves her table and heads for the ladies, Josie follows…..The story unravels via alternating points of view and via a Netflix podcast/documentary entitled ‘ Hi! I’m your birthday twin’. This format works very well as it’s slickly and skilfully told in this experienced writers hands.This is just soooo good that it is very hard to put down. The characterisation is excellent and I’m going to say little about either Alix or Josie as that is one of the joys of the book to discover for yourself! Your views on both of them undergo several U-turns via the plot revelations which makes for fascinating and at times, horrifying reading. One character in particular is a puzzling conundrum to say the very least!The Netflix extracts are particularly powerful as they pile intrigue on intrigue, to say nothing of the building suspense. Things escalate to such a degree you find yourself furiously turning pages in disbelief and yes, there are some jaw droppers! If you add in bad vibes, off notes and some weird and uncomfortable situations that your reactions switch between sadness, concern and shock in equal measure. Oh boy, does the plot ever become intense with examples of dysfunction on a level that beggars belief. The plot twists, turns and barrels it’s way at a fast pace to a good ending which isn’t neatly sewn up but which feels real as, let’s face it, life frequently isn’t tied up in a pretty bow.Overall, this is a cracking read from a very accomplished author who sure understands how to entertain her readers.With thanks to NetGalley and especially to Random House U.K., Cornerstone for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.",5
1308,None of This Is True,"None of This is True couldn’t be more apt for the title.Alix Summers, a popular podcaster, is out celebrating her forty-fifth birthday when she meets her birthday twin Josie Fair. She doesn’t think much more about it until she runs into Josie again outside her children’s school. One thing leads to another, and Josie convinces Alix they should make a podcast about Josie’s life, sharing her truth and making some big changes.Alix believes Josie has a compelling story to tell, even if she finds her unsettling and a bit intense. Things escalate quickly, and the two women’s lives become inextricably tied.If this book didn’t victim blame a thirteen-year-old girl, it would have been a four-star read. A teen is incapable (and inculpable) of holding any power over a creepy middle-aged man.I was engrossed in this story until Walter’s crimes were glossed over. It seems his repeated pedophilia was excusable because he was supposedly a good father. Can a pedo even be a good father? It doesn’t add up.Until this point, I found the story utterly compelling. I could feel Alix’s anxieties and Josie’s oppressive presence, but it all went downhill from there. The more I think about it, the worse it gets.",2
1309,None of This Is True,"Hi! I’m Your Birthday Twin!A Documentary from Podcaster Alix Summer, Coming SOON to Netflix! (in the book)Alix Summer was celebrating her 45th birthday with a large group of friends at her local Pub, when she meets her birthday twin in the Ladies room-an unassuming woman called Josie Fair, who was quietly celebrating with just one older gentleman. Turns out they were both born on the same day, in the same year at the same hospital.Alix was known for a series of popular Podcasts called “All Woman” about successful local women, but it was time for something fresh and new. So when she “accidentally” bumps into her “birthday twin” again, a few days later, and Josie suggests that she might be an interesting subject, because Alix can follow her AS she changes her life instead of after someone has ALREADY done so, Alix decides to record a “test session” to see how it goes.A woman’s voice fades in…The things that Josie begins to share are QUITE shocking, and like an accident you can’t look away from, Alix cannot stop listening.BUT-how much of it is true?What if, NONE OF IT WAS TRUE?Alix has now passed the point of no return, and because of this-her recordings, interspersed throughout the narrative, have just become part of a TRUE CRIME podcast and SHE is now its subject.What will the result be, when the final screen fades to black?Who is Josie Fair, and what has she really done?There are TWO things you can ALWAYS count on with Lisa Jewell.First, if you handed me the first three chapters of a story in a binder, with no title and asked me to guess the author-I could identify her distinctive writing by her often QUIRKY and always well developed characters.Although our “host” Alix, is a likable mom, sister and wife-her husband, Nathan, has a bit of a drinking problem and often goes off on benders, not returning home until the next afternoon.And, we have Josie, the original subject of the Podcast, a shy woman who always dresses in denim, and who carries her Pomchi dog, Fred, clutched close to her chest in a denim pouch, his collar and lead, both made of denim too. (Don’t worry, no harm comes to Fred!)And, she isn’t the only peculiar one….It’s always fun to meet her new charactersBut, please be aware-Lisa Jewell is NOT AFRAID to go there!WARNING ⚠️ There IS an “ICK” factor to this book, and some of the subjects in the podcast include pedophiles, child abuse, and incest.

1311,None of This Is True,"3.5⭐In 2019, “Birthday Twins” Alix Summers and Josie Fair meet for the first time on their forty–fifth birthday in a pub where they have both come to celebrate- Alix with her husband and friends and Josie with her husband.Josie is curious to know more about Alix and looks her up on the internet and finds out that Alix is a popular podcaster known for sharing the stories of strong women who have overcome the odds to exact positive change in their lives. Josie approaches Alix with the idea of being a subject of her next podcast feature citing the fact that she is in the process of making big changes in her life. Alix is both intrigued and a tad unsettled by Josie’s intensity and eventually agrees. Josie’s revelations about her past and her marriage are shocking and Alix finds herself becoming inextricably drawn into Josie’s narrative. Alix begins to doubt some parts of Josie’s revelations when she talks to people who know her and have interacted with her in the past. Just how much of Josie’s story is true? Josie seems to be fixated on Alix and is curious about Alix’s marriage which is also somewhat troubled. What follows is a complex web of lies, deceit, manipulation and murder. All is revealed when Alix becomes the subject of a true crime podcast to be featured in a Netflix documentary in 2020.None of This is TruebyLisa Jewellis a masterfully crafted work of psychological fiction- the kind of dark, edgy and suspenseful story that makes Lisa Jewell one of my favorite authors in this genre. Complex characters, shocking twists and several surprises (till the very end) and an ending that leaves you unsettled, made for a riveting read. I loved the structure of the novel, which is presented from the perspectives of Josie and Alix with transcripts of the podcast interviews (featuring Josie, Alix and several other characters) interspersed throughout the narrative.Having said that, there are a few things that keep me from giving this novel a higher rating. I know this is fiction and but a few things did bother me. None of the characters are particularly likeable (some worse than the others) which is fine. I know this is fiction but I could not ignore certain aspects of the story no matter how much I tried. Alix's inability to read the situation, her apparent blindness to several red flags in Josie’s behavior and her insensitivity to some extremely disturbing aspects of Josie’s life was off-putting. I also had issues with certain choices that were made in the handling of Josie’s present storyline. The author ventures into some very dark and disturbing themes in this novel (grooming, pedophilia, sexual abuse of a minor, trauma and mental health) and I’m not comfortable with the way those topics were presented.Overall, this is an intense and suspenseful read that delivers on the thrills. For the rest, it boils down to the reader’s ability and/or willingness to ignore certain aspects of the story.Many thanks to Atria Books and NetGalley for the digital review copy of this novel.

1313,None of This Is True,"My Reviews Can Also Be Found On:Twitter-Amazon-Storygraph-The Book Review Crew3.5 StarsThis is my sixth book by this author, she is obviously a favourite of mine and I had really high hopes for this one and it is getting rave reviews everywhere. I did enjoy it for the most part BUT the title is a spoiler for sure. The first two-thirds of the book was gripping and I would have given that five stars, but the last bit was anti-climatic.The story itself is very immersive and it was a quick read that was easy to follow along. I even found the characters compelling, learning about their history and Josie's background. I didn't like the fact that one of them is the typical needy/oppressed housewife who envies and wants another's life, there are so many books like that out there. I also found that the character of Alix was just too easily manipulated by Josie.The format was unique as it uses a podcast and a Netflix show as part of the story. And even though it was a huge letdown in the surprise department it was still a fun read. BUT after a very strong start, and me loving the short chapters the ending was kind of ambiguous and left me wanting more.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.",3
1314,None of This Is True,"**Many thanks to NetGalley, Atria, and Lisa Jewell for an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review! Now available as of 8.8!!**Imagine you're at a birthday dinner with anyone close to you...a friend, a significant other, a few family members.And though you're thrilled to be there and order something special, there's a TINY part of you that is dreading the possibility that at any moment, a server (or a cadre of servers) are going to come your way carrying a cake and singing the obligatory Happy Birthday song (or the restaurant approved version, anyway.)And what if THAT dread was only the beginning?While podcaster Alix Summers is out with her husband to celebrate her 45th, after the big song, a woman named Josie approaches the table and informs her that she is her TRUE birthday twin---down to the year. Though Alix finds this surprising, the two go about their separate celebrations and she figures that will be the end of it.UNTILJosie happens to run into Alix yet again - this time, outside of her children's school - and Josie has become completely enamored with Alix's podcast. In fact, she thinks she has the perfect candidate for Alix's next episode:Josie Fair herself.All Josie tells Alix initially is that she's looking for a change and a fresh start in her life...but nothing can prepare Alix for the details to come. Josie reveals shocking secret after shocking secret about her dangerous past and evenMOREdangerous present -- stories of grooming and abuse that haven't quite ended yet. Josie's predicament terrifies Alix...but at the same time, this mysterious and quirky woman slowly worms her way further into Alix's life...and her home.Although she wants to help her, Alix fears that this case may be far more involved than any she's explored in her podcast thus far. Will Josie's desperation to escape her situation lead her to say just aboutANYTHINGto get out, once and for all?And just how much of this 'true crime' tale is, well, TRUE?Lisa Jewell has been around the scene for a while now: this is herELEVENTHthriller after making the transition from romance novels. Even Jewell herself has said her thrillers follow a general trend: now and then timelines, unlikable characters, at LEAST one teenage POV...and there's often a big 'didn't know they were related' reveal.This formula has suited her well, and I've never doubted her ability to write a compelling narrative.Whether I agreed with the way it played out or not, despite occasional uneven pacing, I'm a Jewell fan through and through and also feel like I have a good sense of what to expect when I grab one of her books.Well. To say this one threwALL of my preconceived notions out of the windowCOULD be the understatement of theYEAR!This is a darker Jewell...a more DISTURBED Jewell...and in some ways it was everything I could have asked for in her evolution as an author.That being said, there were a few aspects of this plot that kept it from being a 5 star read for me and more than a few times I wished I could slowly back away from the characters in this book....and faster than Usain,BOLT!🏃‍♂️First off, I am the last person to be excited by the premise of a true crime podcast/documentary/Netflix show etc.But WOWZA. If Jewell wanted to shelve novel writing and jump into screenwriting TOMORROW, I think she could do it.The Netflix show ABOUT the podcast is cleverly and neatly interspersed into the narrative, and I kid you not, every time one of these sections popped up,I could almost SEE the drama unfolding before me.Rather than a plot device, it felt like an evocative and intriguing way to leave a tiny trail of breadcrumbs throughout the story to keep you dying for more detail, more insight, and that next provocative interview. Needless to say, if this were a real Netflix documentary...UTTERLY bingeable.These characters though...they might have been her most unlikable group to date. Even protagonist Alix has her blinders on selectively throughout and doesn't exactly do her due diligence with, well, anything. Josie is obviously a woman of mystery, but as a reader,I had a hard time buying her stories and suspected that a LOT was wrong with this situation (beyond the obvious).Nevertheless, I was excited to get to the bottom of things and had a hard time stopping myself from extrapolating endlessly as the novel wore on, with theory after theory about all of the players involved.But then it's revealed, amidst a sea of lies, that one story was TRUE: a character involved in grooming a young woman really DID groom said teenager.And where this should have left another character horrified, it was basically brushed aside entirely because the same character is painted to be a ""good guy"" for other reasons. Not only is this not the first time Jewell has done this sort of thing, but it took what wasSUCHa disturbing and powerful narrative to a sort of icky place. In a book that turns out to not be AS full of bad people as you may initially believe...there was no need for this turnaround.The character in question didn't really DESERVE any sort of redemptive mention or a 'pass' for the disgusting behavior...EVEN if someone else turns out to be worse, and I just wish that Jewell hadn't soured such a strong and impactful story with this choice.At the end of a particularly sinister and AMAZING horror movie, I always have that moment where I'm GRATEFUL to leave the theater, blink in the sunlight, and feel part of the less ominous real world.This book took me to that same sort of deep, scary place...and while I did manage to enjoy most of the ride?I have NEVER been more relieved to pick up my sunglasses and bask in the warm comforting glow of the summer sun!🕶 🌞4 stars",4
1315,None of This Is True,"2.5⭐️ the best part of this book is that it's finally overMy work colleagues might fight me on this one on Monday 🤭 was the premise good? yes, very good actually. It was new and fun and twisty and I loved it.Unfortunately as the story progressed every character became less interesting. I thought oh wait but the storyline build-up is good so maybe there's still time to save the book. Guess what? it didn't save the book 😬 the last 20% was very anticlimactic and some twists just ruined the book for me.*** incoming minor spoiler...So you want to tell me that every person was defending on a pedophile and the mc's mum is viciously angry because her 16 year old daughter seduced a 43 year old man who was married to another woman but having an affair with this little girl's mum? 😳😳😳",2
1316,None of This Is True,"All the stars! Hands-down, the best audio production of 2023!🙌Josie is out for her birthday dinner with husband Walter. At the next table is Alix, celebrating her birthday with her husband and friends as well. As Josie strike up a conversation in the ladies room she realizes not only were they born on the same day…but in the same hospital.What are the odds she’d come face to face with her birthday twin!👭Soon Josie enmeshes herself fully into Alix’s life. Even suggesting Alix, a famous podcaster, create a podcast all about Josie’s life.This is where you need to start questioning what is truth and what is a lie! Good luck with that one!The audio was brilliant! The two principal narrators did a thoroughly amazing job bringing Josie and Alix to vivid life. The supporting cast of narrators that lent their gifted voices to the ‘podcasts’ were phenomenal as well!This book needs to be experienced in the audio format! My favorite Lisa Jewell book to date!",5
1317,None of This Is True,"Lisa Jewell is the queen of the dark thriller!If you are a sensitive reader, be aware there are trigger warnings galore, but know the events take place off the page.And what a tale it was…Alix Summer is a popular podcaster who is celebrating her 45th birthday when she meets Josie, also celebrating her 45th birthday. Birthday twins! How fun. (Or not!)Josie tells Alix she is about to make big changes in her life and wants Alix to document it for her podcast. Alix agrees, as this could be her big break. As the interviews unfold, we learn the secrets of both women.Alix’s life and marriage is far from perfect, and Josie likes to call her out on the situation. By the time Alix feels unease, Josie has wormed her way into Alix’s life and home, with repercussions that are unforeseeable and devastating.I enjoyed the alternating POV of both women which includes transcriptions of the podcast and scenes from a Netflix documentary on the case.The reader knows this isn’t going to end well, but when the inevitable twist came, I had to pick my jaw off the floor…it was brilliant.My reading buddy, Marialyce, and I had a fabulous discussion as we tried to suss out the ending. Who is truthful and who is not? For us, a story that is discussion worthy is the mark of a great read. All the stars! There is a LOT to unpack here.A winner for Lisa Jewell who has written a literary thriller of substance!* I received a digital copy of the book via NetGalley. All opinions are my own.*I also listened to it on audio, which was very well done!",5
1318,None of This Is True,"The audio production was outstanding and with an ominous tone (5 star performance)!I lost track of how many times I nearly fell off the couch! Although, I could never get quite comfy. It is NOT a comfy kind of read. 🖤I had a sense of panic from the beginning when the ""birthday twins"" Alix and Josie unexpectantly meet. The story became darker than dark the further I read. It was quite unputdownable and going places that gave me anxiety. I think Alix felt it too, I wanted to shake her!! Tell her to just R-U-N 🏃‍♂️A slippery slope of truth! Who do I believe? Who will you believe? Everyone is flawed and makes questionable, even detestable decisions. The characters were mostly abhorrent and toxic.Lets just pack all the toxicity into one novel shall we - a pedo, a narcissist, an alcoholic and a psycopath! The train wreck is coming at full speed. In the end though, I still wanted a little bit more after all the highs and lows, something was missing for me.I've made up my mind about the ending, and I hope I'll stop thinking about it now!Library Audio / Published on July 20, 2023",4
1319,None of This Is True,"3.75 starshonestly,the title itself is basically a spoiler.so… that’s an interesting decision…because of this, the plot was not incredibly surprising and the plot twists were extremely mild/predictable…BUTallof it was unsettling and i enjoyed the vibe. i loved the documentary/podcast aspect of the book!not a bad way to start spooky season. i’m very harsh on thrillers (i’m sorry!!) so a thriller above 3 stars is a winner in my book.",3
1320,None of This Is True,"This book started off on a really good foot. The storyline was gripping. I was invested. I liked how this book took the podcast element up a notch by adding a Netflix documentary spin. However, the last 20% of the book was a huge disappointment. Without getting into spoilers, this story has two possible scenarios that are left open for the readers' interpretation on what the truth is (if you don't like open ended endings then you won't like this book). However, either way you swing it, there is one particular character who is 100% a horrific person regardless of which scenario is correct. Sure, that particular character did meet their fate in this book, however, why did they get a redemption arc/sympathy. I thought it was in bad taste. Lisa Jewell completely missed an opportunity with this one, but instead decided to victim blame a 13-year-old who was groomed by a 40 year old and married her abuser. I almost settled on 2 stars because I did enjoy the book up until that point. However, the more time went by after I finished this book, the more enraged I became. I am not a sensitive reader, so for me to be offended by a book, it has to really grind my gears.Thank you Netgalley, Atria Books, and Lisa Jewell for the eARC.Expected Publication Date: 8/8/2023",1
1321,None of This Is True,"I finished this audiobook a few days ago and I’m still unpacking my thoughts about it. If nothing else, Lisa Jewell knows how to create conflicting feelings in me!Two women, Alix Summer and Josie Fair, meet on the evening of their mutual 45th birthdays. Alix has a popular podcast and an enviable life with a husband, two kids and a nice home. Josie has a significantly older husband, two troubled daughters and a host of secrets. In Alix, her birthday twin, Josie sees an opportunity to change it all by convincing Alix a couple days later to feature her in her next podcast, promising to share her secrets and show listeners her transformation.Despite Josie’s odd demeanor, Alix bites and agrees to the podcast. Little does she know that her choice will bite her back!As Alix digs deeper into Josie’s life and her secrets trickle out, a much more troubling picture emerges. Did Josie’s husband groom her when she was a teen? Did she enter the relationship voluntarily? When Josie shows up beaten and bruised one night on Alix’s doorstep, she leaves Alix little choice but to let her stay temporarily. Unfortunately, Josie isn’t content to just complain about her own husband … Alix’s husband is also subject to Josie’s scathing opinions.What becomes of this unwanted house guest? That’s the mystery, and it’s a good one! This started very slow for me, and I wasn’t sure I was going to like it, but once Alix’s podcast about Josie got underway, things started to get juicy! The full-cast audiobook narrators did a wonderful job capturing the personalities at play. Josie’s flat, subdued voicing performed by Nicola Walker added a particular menace to things. She creeped me out!I genuinely liked the story, and I think Jewell does a great job keeping the reader pulled into the story. She scattered secrets like candy pieces, which I happily gobbled up along the way, using a nice mix of detail from Josie herself, interviews with people from her past, her mother and others to provide variety and intrigue. The story provoked all my feelings, giving me shades ofMy Dark VanessaandGreenwich Park, among other books.Here’s where I had to drop a star, though, and I’ll admit it was personal. One of the characters is an alcoholic, and it felt like they were given a free pass for their bad behavior, like I was expected to sympathize with them and understand why they behaved so poorly. Having grown up in such a household, I fully understand people being broken and needing help, but I found it a little insulting to be asked to see the character as a ""good person"" in light of the damage done. That’s a me thing.All things said, Jewell did a great job with this and the audio production was top notch. I recommend this to anyone who likes a solid suspenseful psychological thriller/mystery!★★★★",4
1322,None of This Is True,"If none of this is true, why am I reading this? Why am I wasting my time, Jewel? You think you can just pull the wool over my eyes?But….what if the proclamations of falsehoods are actually true? Sometimes nothing is ever as it seems.A high octane page turning mystery. A whacked out female who latches on to her birthday twin stranger she meets at a pub. It did have me guessing as to who this twisted sister was.One irritation was the structure….it was a story revealed through a podcast then on Netflix. Too layered.Jewel, this isn’t your finest gem. It was a little drawn out for me but it did make me curious.3.75⭐️",3
1323,None of This Is True,"Okay this is definitely an interesting ride. Two women living two totally different and separate lives are brought together in a pub on the same night because they share the same birthday. One of them is a nut job and the story goes from there. Different than most thrillers I’ve read, but I needed more from the ending! Solid 4",4
1324,None of This Is True,"Gripping with ""surround sound"" audio! 😘🔊Lisa Jewell doesn't disappoint. This mystery deals with abuse claimed by a wife to a much older man. Josie was sixteen when she married her husband 30 years her senior. Now Josie thinks he's a pedophile and has been sneaking into their daughter's room during the night.Alix is a successful podcaster who features inspiring women. While celebrating her 45th birthday she bumps into Josie who shares the same birthday, and birthplace. Such a coincidence! Josie has a story to tell and pitch that idea to be on Alix's show.With heavy themes and creepy personalities of certain characters,None of This is Trueis a page-turner that made my head spin trying to outsmart Ms. Jewell knowing I'll be duped one way or another. Who can I believe?None of This Is Truehas a terrific immersive audio production with a full cast. Love the podcast segments on this audiobook.",4
1325,None of This Is True,"I readNone of This Is Truelike it was on fire, turning the pages as fast as I could for fear of burning my fingers. It’s addictive. Riveting. It’s pretty much all the adjectives you want to see in a review for a thriller.And it’s trademark Lisa Jewell. I’ve read enough of her novels to know she has a type. Meaning, the bad guys are really bad and often guilty of some sort of abuse, and the good guys are quirky and tend to make horrible decisions.When Alix invites Josie into her home to record a podcast about Josie’s life, all signs are pointing to it not ending well. Josie is downright creepy, and Alix, being a typical Jewell character, ignores her screaming gut instinct to turn Josie away. I guess for Alix, the promise of a viral podcast outweighs all else.It’s from here on out that Alix’s relationship with Josie spirals out of control and the thriller madness begins. But this time, the story Jewell tells isn’t quite as straightforward as some of her others. Even at the very end, the truth of the events in the novel is blurred, leaving the reader with unanswered questions and no sense of closure, and also left murky is the line between pedophile and victim.Which is difficult to stomach. Because a pedophile is a predator and a child is achild, and to put any sort of blame on a child is misplaced.But despite my qualms about the ending, I must give credit where it’s due. Jewell’s latest is a fantastic read, and yes, I recommend it.",4
1326,People We Meet on Vacation,"I believe in the concept of soulmates.This may seem at odds with my overall extremely cool, edgy reputation, but let me explain. Sure, your soulmate might be Some Guy, but equally it might be the feeling of flipping your pillow over to the cool side, or when the airplane seems to be fully booked but slowly the trickle of people doing that awkward slow-walk to stow their luggage comes to a stop and there's no one sitting in your row, or those authentic actual cream puffs where the puff part is pretty dry and disappointing but the cream is like ice cream if ice cream was actually good. (I do not like ice cream. This is just one more point in favor of my potentially being an alien.)You may believe that I have opened this review of a romance novel with a discussion of soulmates in a way to tie in the content of the book, and in a way, you would be right. But not really.Sure, yeah, the Alex and Poppy contained within these pages are probably soulmates, as is the case with, you know, the genre as a whole.But I'm here to talk about MY soulmate. And with every passing day I become more convinced that surely, certainly, without a doubt, that that role in my life is filled by Emily Henry.Okay, no. That's a bridge too far in creepiness levels even for me in my love for her, a love which I have declared in multiple reviews here, on my blog, in my now-defunct bookstagram in a series of tangential-to-stalking posts, in one of those letter boards I used to have when they were trendy, in her DMs, in her comments, and so on.But I should clarify that it's her WRITING that is my soulmate.My favorite super-specific subgenre of all time is magical realism where I can really believe that the magic might just exist in our dumb old boring world, and she is the master of that. Plus she includes lovely romances and incredible banter and the best ever friendships and a million other good and perfect things.I cried on a Greyhound bus rereadingA Million Junes. I, a person who does not cry even in the privacy of my own oblivion AND a person who does everything but cease to exist when on a cross-country bus trip, cried! While REREADING!I lovedWhen the Sky Fell on Splendorso much that I...also made my review a love letter to its author!I so adoredThe Love That Split the Worldthat I basically almost looked past the insta-love, something that has previously forever been impossible for me to do!And when I heard aboutBeach Read, an adult rom-com interrupting an all-star lineup of YA magical realism, I wrote the email equivalent of getting on my knees and begging to the publisher right away.And like everything else Emily Henry writes, it was a mix of fairytale-like dreaminess and real-world Harsh Reality. It had the real characters and the engrossing writer and the dialogue of a champion like everything else.And this did too!The romance was slow-burn and lovely, Alex and Poppy are complete dreamboats, the travel component was something I didn't know I needed or could even HAVE, and in short this was just very good. Even if it's not my favorite genre, or my favorite tropes - it is my favorite author.A big part of me hopes that someday, Emily Henry will get back to the young adult magical realism that has made it to my top five favorite books and my top favorites of the year and the hard to reach upper echelons of my grueling rating system several times over.But if she doesn't, that's okay too. I'd read math textbooks if she wrote them. (But only then and not a moment before!)Plus she's got that instant #1 New York Times bestseller status, and that, I am willing to admit, is ever so slightly more prestigious (not to mention financially rewarding) than my enduring love and affection.And she has that anyway.Bottom line: Emily Henry forever!!!-------------pre-reviewand the emily henry withdrawal starts...now.(it actually started last night, when i finished this book, but it hit too hard for me to even mark it as read.)review to come / 4 stars!-------------currently-reading updatesi would die for emily henry, but that wouldn't help me get my hands on this book as soon as possible.so i subscribed to book of the month instead.-------------tbr reviewsome people write enemies to lovers romance. some people write friends to lovers romance.emily henry said why not BOTH...nobody is doing it like her!!!-------------announcement reviewwho do i have to bribe to get my hands on this book?i am willing to offer anything.

1327,People We Meet on Vacation,"A light-heartened and quick read that is totally predictable, entirely forgettable, and unoriginal.Poppy and Alex go on a vacation together every year. But will Poppy and Alex ever get together?This was just like The Bachelor, You've Got Mail, and a touch of The Notebook. Usually, I don't read romance but this one had some high reviews on GoodReads, and I wasn't so sure on the thriller I had selected.This book had a very light hearted feel which was nice after the last book that I read that literally was so dark that I was having nightmares. However, it was entirely predictable. After about halfway through, I was wondering OK can we just get there already? These romance type books really bother me because they are so unrealistic. Poppy lives in New York and has a jet-set lifestyle while Alex still lives in their small Mid-West town in Ohio, working as a teacher at the public high school. The characters are so quick to give up everything in their lives. In the real world, some things can't be changed so easily. Some people are not compatible no matter how much they love each other. It is a big deal for one person to want to get married, have children, own their own house, and the other person never wants to get married, never wants to have children, and wants to live with a bunch of people in a commune. Some people need a quiet calm place to feel safe. They need to have a job so that they feel financially safe especially when the other party doesn't want to get married. Just agreeing to ""everything"" will not work out long term.This book could have been so much better. In fact, it could have shown that there are some people who are wonderful to be around and go on vacation with, but they are not good at sharing your life with. For example, you might be madly in love with someone with a gambling/drug addiction. That person might make you feel like you are the most important person in the world, make you laugh and smile, and your eyes alight every time you think of that person. But you can't live with that person. You can't depend on that person to make sure that the rent will be paid or that they can show up to take you to your doctor's appointment. This book totally glossed over the fact that you can have deep, intense, magnetic, earth-shattering feelings for someone, but the relationship will not work out. It would have been so much better if Sara actually said, ""I know he loves you Poppy, but he gets you one week out of the year and he's mine the other 51. I want him to travel the world, and that's love, not standing in his way.""That my friends is the difference between memorable and forgettable. That's why we remember Casablanca, because the ending isn't predictable, and Rick was honest, realistic.The author also could have done a better job with the romance. Poppy and Alex have been doing this tango for 12 years. Yet we are supposed to believe that they just spontaneously happened to have these encounters? It rained so they decided to take their friendship to the next level? That is so lame. Alex couldn't think of anything more thoughtful (even though he is supposed to be this incredibly thoughtful guy)? He didn't buy all of the flowers in the flower shop? He didn't tell Poppy that she looked beautiful in the light? He didn't save up all of his credit card points to try to take her to a nice vacation, something that would really ""speak to her"" as a traveling guru? He didn't try to show off his muscles to try to catch her eye?

1328,People We Meet on Vacation,"I think I want to give million hugs to author right now! I fell so hard for her latest book Beach Read which is still my favorite romance book of last year!I thought nothing she may write could be better than this lyrical/ dreamy/ feel good- tear jerker love story . But after reading this freaking heartbreaking amazing book I’m taking all back: this book is the best thing I’ve read for so long! And I can honestly say this is is going to be not this year’s best romance read for me but it also will take its space at my all time favorite and at least three times must read list! It’s freaking good!It is unbelievably amazing mash up of When Harry Met Sally- Love, Rosie- One Day with combinations of 90’s best Meg Ryan romcoms vibes!The couple’s first meeting and their road trip is truly inspired by When Harry Met Sally as the author mentioned at the end of the book but their 12 hilarious, inspirational, adventurous, exciting trips and the way of storytelling makes you gather the clues to find the missing matches to complete the puzzle to understand their 12 years long friendship zone relationship is outstandingly smart.Poppy and Alex were so so real, so powerful, so genuine! I feel like I have been knowing them for a long time. They’re polar opposites, wanting different things from life. As Poppy hates Linfield and khakis, those two things are Alex’s favorite things. As Poppy is vivid, energetic, hyperactive, adventurer, risk taker, Alex is more serene, picky, bookish, calm, controlling. Poppy never wants to settle down, desiring to experience different things from the life as Alex sticks to his routine, living at the same neighborhood, dreaming of being a happy family man.But could wanting to different things from life stop them to yearn for each other?Two years ago something happened in their Croatia trip. Now Poppy misses her friend like crazy, she’s not happy with her life and she cannot concentrate on her job! She decides to dodge a bullet, asking her best friend for one last trip to Palm Springs to fix their relationship. What could go wrong when you’re having an adventurous holiday with your favorite person?Right!???I don’t want to give any spoilers but I can only say one thing. There’s a part at the last third: Poppy gives a powerful and bold speech at the bar: the speech made me cried for at least three hours! My husband finally lost control and put duct tapes to my mouth to make me shut up. I think I’m also suffering from dried eye syndrome. I may have dropped at least five gallons of tears and I think I’m out of tears for a long time! But that emotional speech and entire book made my entire year!I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH! I LOVED IT SO MUCH!Okay, I’m stopping right now! I’m giving five gazillion stars to this amazing book and I’m specifically giving the last third: entire galaxy!I’m million times thankful to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this fantastic reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter",5
1329,People We Meet on Vacation,"People We Meet on Vacationis a sweet, fluffy, beachy read that gets a little long in the tooth towards the end.Poppy and Alex have been best friends since college. Even though they are as different as two people can be, they just get each other. As life keeps them apart geographically, their only chance to catch up in person is to take an epic summer trip together every year. But two years ago, they had a falling out and haven't spoken since. Now Poppy wants one more trip to fix everything.The trope of friends to lovers has been done so many times, yet this book finds a way to give it a fresh take. Poppy and Alex are fun and hilarious together, and I found myself smiling through all their banter and interactions. Poppy is the zany one while Alex is the straight lace, but both are equally loveable in their own way.Where this story fell a bit short is towards the end. I started to find Poppy's antics too over-the-top. Often, instead of just saying what she's feeling, she'll go and do crazy things to avoid talking. She starts coming across as needy and high-maintenance, sending mixed signals and jerking Alex around. And poor Alex just had to take it.I also found their inability to admit how they feel about each other getting old. It was cute and endearing earlier in the book because they didn't know. But once they figured it out and acted on it, I don't understand why they continued to deny their feelings. It reminds me of Chinese gift-giving culture, where the receiver of the gift (of love, in this case) has to refuse many times before finally accepting in order to avoid appearing greedy or eager. They'll say things like ""I can't possibly accept! This is too much! I don't deserve it!"" Meanwhile I'm like, please just accept this love for goodness' sake, so I can move on with my life.Romance books are so personal. What works for one person doesn't always work for another. Usually we are drawn to the stories that remind us of ourselves and our love language. And this is a case where the longer the book went on, the less I could see myself in Poppy.Still, other than the drawn out ending, I very much enjoyed this story. It was such a fun and funny romance, with its jet-setting and vacation-y scenes. It makes me want to pack a bag, fly somewhere tropical, and sit on a beach with one those little drinks with an umbrella in it. And in that respect, this book hits the perfect spot.This was a pick for my Book of the Month box. Get your first book for $5here.",3
1330,People We Meet on Vacation,"“I’ll never belong anywhere like I belong with you”4.5 starsThis book was phenomenal, friends to lovers excellence if you will. In this story we follow two best friends, Alex and Poppy, who always take an annual summer vacation together. After a mysterious incident two years ago the two have drifted apart but Poppy proposes one last trip to save their friendship.This book was full of mutual pining, inside jokes and amazing chemistry. The romantic tension between Alex and Poppy was just so well done I was sold on them as a couple almost immediately. I felt like they knew and understood each other so intimately and it honestly was so swoon worthy. The mortifying ordeal of being known is so worth it! This was really gripping, loved the writing, the humor, the banter, the angst! It was just so great 🥰 I read it in under 24hrs because I couldn’t put it down. Highly recommend!!Also I totally made a playlist for this book so if anyone’s interested 👀https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Qe...",5
1331,People We Meet on Vacation,"a much needed palate cleanser. <3_________________gahhhh. i would die to have a connection/bond with someone as cute, wholesome, hilarious, and passionate as poppy and alex have with each other. better yet, just give me alex. hes what i really want. lol.even though i love romance books, i wouldnt consider myself an especially romantic or sentimental person. but wow, EH has made me once again wish that her stories were my reality. i mean, the humour. the chemistry. the tender way heavy topics are discussed. the realness of it all. the easy-breezy writing that makes me tear up at times. everything about this is so easy to love and want.its pretty much perfection on paper.↠5 stars",5

1340,People We Meet on Vacation,"I have beenin desperate need of this exact combination of opposites attractandEmily Henry has served us!!!Poppy and Alex have an unlikely friendship. Poppy is free spirited, quirky and outgoing. Alex is quiet and prefers to stay indoors with a book.They meet during orientation week in college and become friends after an awkward car ride home.After college they mostly live far apart however every summer they take a trip together and go on exciting adventures.Until one summer, everything falls apart.Now, after two years of not talking, Poppy is determined to fix things with Alex. She manages to persuade him to go on one last vacation where she has one week to convince Alex to give their friendship another go.Beach Read was one of my absolute favourite reads of 2020. So i went into this one with my fingers crossed, peaking through one eye,just in caseit didnt live up to Beach Read.I cannot put into wordshow ECSTATIC i was to find thatit surpassed my hopes.Its scary how perfect this book was (for me). I feel like the author stole my dreams (like the giant in the bfg hehehheheh) of the 💕perfect romance book💕 and picked every single trope that i loved and mashed it into one book.Here are the tropes this book included:best friends to lovers (the superior trope). Grumpy/sunshine. witty banter. there's only one bed. opposites attract. slow burn. lots of yearning and pining. TENSION FOR DAYS.The writing was like a bowl of chocolate mousse. Smooth, lovely and addictive.After the first spoonful (or in this case: page)i could not put it down!We follow their friendship from the day they met with chapters alternating between past and present.At the time i read this (January 2021) i had been in lockdown for almost 10 months.And when i tell you i was living vicariously through Alex and Poppy 😉🚣‍♀️. I felt like i was there with them visiting these beautiful places. ((Lowkey jealous of them tbh 💅🏽 ))Poppy was so cute and i loved her so much. I found some parts of her so relatable and i just wanted her to be happy.Alex was.... *whispers*....everythingggggggg.My sweet cinnamon roll introvert. *weeps* i want him 😭.Y'all can thirst all you want over your smirking badboys. Just leave Alex with me mmkay?I really enjoyed the chapters set in the Past. We get to see Poppy and Alexs' friendship grow and it was beautiful to see how much they cared for each other before romantic feelings came into play.And then the Present chapters were filled with tension and yearning. *dies*You and Me on Vacation/People We Meet on Vacationmade me laugh, itmade me cry, it made me 🥰'aawwwwwwww'🥰 - just,, ALL THE FEELSIn conclusion, this book was *chefs kiss* from beginning to end and i wish i had a physical copy so i can highlight all my favourite parts and stain the pages with my tears of happiness.(If you are Emily Henry and youre, by some wild chance, reading this: hi i love you so much can i be your best friend? Pls tell everyone alex is mine)« e-arc kindly sent to me by Penguin Random House and Berkley in exchange for an honest review »• Release Date: 11 May 2021 •Read my review ofBeach Read by Emily Henry___",5
1341,People We Meet on Vacation,"Hello, unpopular opinion. You were not invited. Like, at all, yet you had the nerve to show up anyway. I was looking forward to being part of the crowd but you had to ruin it.Incoming a slight rant review.Quite frankly, I was in denial about the fact that this book wasn’t working for me. Especially since Emily Henry has worked for me. Ridiculously well, I might add.But the self-inflicted denial didn’t allow me to see past the rose-tinted glasses I had on and come to terms with the fact that the story was boring me.It was boring.I get that Poppy and Alex were on vacation, the noun is in the damn title and it’s essential to the story.I think.But the holiday settings were so boring to read about. The constant flashbacks were giving me confusion and I LOVE books that include the past and present timeline. They usually add depth and clarity to the story. But these flashbacks seemed to be about everything but them. There was too much vacationing and not enough Poppy and Alex moments. Bar the cute little dialogues and banter we would get in between.Where was the emotion at? The angst that is supposed to come alongside the fact that you are not seeing your friend as a friend any longer? Was that present? Because I must’ve missed the build-up.Now, imagine if the holiday settings were reduced — or better yet replaced — and we got to see more of Alex and Poppy’s friendship building and seeing that dynamic change throughout those ‘past’ summers. Seeing their families and their insecurities about taking on life. Their damn childhoods. I would’ve latched on more, but the emotions and development were missing, because they were on fuckin’ vacation. 😑So, I checked out.I partially skim-read. Did I really care about how hot the weather was and the side characters that were passing along? No. Did I care about the sightseeing elements? That’s another no. And I definitely did not care for their useless exes.I was desperate for more of them together, in whatever capacity and we only got that towards the end. And those moments were so fuckin’ adorable and disgustingly sweet that I’m mad that we didn’t get more.It was too little, too late and not enough to save this book for me by that point. There was so much of that that could’ve been sprinkled throughout the story and I don’t get why that wasn’t done.And do not get me started on the conflict. Ludacris!And thus, here I stand, empty and annoyed. And I feel fuckin’ played.",2
1342,People We Meet on Vacation,"Unpopular opinion: This book was 50% boring and 50% annoying.Alex and Poppy are complete opposites who become friends who both want to become lovers but are too stubborn to try and figure out how to make it work or do that thing best friends usually do calledcommunicate.My biggest issue is there seemed to be zero chemistry between the two.None.I'm a fan of opposites attract but these two were at such opposite ends of the spectrum it didn't seem to work at all. Alex was very anal - in a condescending, uptight way - and Poppy was forever doing her best to be as quirky as possible - in an extremely annoying way that usually included repeating dumb phrases non-stop like saying ""this speaks to me"" to literallyeverything.I'm also not the biggest fan of flashbacks and this book goes back and forth just about every other chapter, flashing back to vacations they've taken over the past ten or so years before bumping back to the present where they're vacationing together again after a two year hiatus because they're stubborn fools.The problem with this? It's incredibly boring. The dialogue and action is so very minimal and its 90% talking about the towns they're in, describing the hotels they stay at, and the tourist attractions they visit. It was a major snoozefest.In the end, these are just two annoying and absolutely ridiculous characters that have both been extremely selfish and idiotic in their relationship as well as their relationships with others and it's hard to even like them. It's more like ayou two deserve each other and shame on your for wasting others timeinstead of ayay they're finally together!The title's a bit wonky in my opinion as well because one, they didn't meet on vacation and two, they didn't meet any story changing people on vacation so the title doesn't make much sense to me.It should have beenVery Detailed Vacations We Took While Being Complete Bozos and Refusing To Admit We Want To Be More Than Best Friends.This honestly pains me because this was one of the few books I preordered this year (Beach Read was amazing so this author was a no brainer buy) and I was so excited to read it but this book just did not do it for me.",2
1343,People We Meet on Vacation,"Re-read 10/19/21: Still such an absolute delight. So excited to read books from Emily Henry for the rest of my life.Original read 5/11/21: 2021 may only be halfway done, but I can already guarantee that this will remain at the top as my favorite book of the year. I've never been the hugest friends-to-lovers fan, but Alex and Poppy's chemistry leapt off of every single page and I have been completely converted and will never be the same. That, on top of the fact that Emily Henry has such a perfect knack for writing realistic characters with real flaws and traits made this a perfect 6-star book for me and I am just absolutely obsessed and cannot wait to read everything she will ever publish. My heart is so full!!!!!!CW: death of a parent",5
1344,People We Meet on Vacation,"4.5 starsShit, this was so cute 😭🥰 I wasn’t sure if this book would be my thing because I was HYPED for Beach Read and it ended up being pretty disappointing, and I’m really not a big fan of the friends to lovers trope, it’s one of my least favorites but I ADORE THIS BOOK. Alex is one of the softest love interests ever and I thought him and Poppy were so cute. Their friendship was so genuine and their banter was so great.I think why this book works for me so much is because we get to see in flashbacks how they met, and all the vacations they have taken together each year in the last ten years. I think so often with friends to lovers the characters have this whole history we don’t get to see as readers and that usually bothers me because I like to see all the things of how their friendship began because it helps me root for them as a couple, so I’m so glad this book included all those flashbacks of them. I also liked how this book had this mystery to it about what happened between them and why they were no longer on speaking terms, it kept me flipping pages wanting to know what happened between them.I love that this book talks about how completing your long term goals can lead to depression, because it’s about the journey, not the destination and how the best way to find your happiness when you lose it is to retrace your steps and think about when was the last time you were truly happy. I thought all of it was great advice and really thought provoking cause I never really thought of it that way, but that’s so true how you can be desperately trying to achieve your goals for months or years and when you finally get there, it can be rewarding but also kind of depressing because you don’t have anything more to look forward to.. and the way this book talks about loneliness and never really feeling like you belong really touched me.Anyways, that was a tangent but I ADORED THIS BOOK. I highlighted and underlined so many parts that made me smile and made me giddy. This was also the perfect escapism I needed because I haven’t been on a vacation in over a year thanks to ms. corona so I was living vicariously through them going on all these vacations 😍 it really was a much needed escape from reality.I’m just so stoked to have enjoyed a romance from Emily Henry! 😍🤩 I can’t wait to see what she writes in the future!",5
1345,People We Meet on Vacation,"Have you ever read a book that makes you wish you could unread it, forget everything, and read it again for the first time? My book hangover from this one is going to kill me. I'm so sad it's over. I loved it SO much. I want to listen to the audiobook and find a signed copy and watch every Zoom appearance the author goes on to talk about the book because it made my heart soooooooo ridiculously happy.The story is told in Poppy's POV and it bounces from present day to flashbacks of her yearly summer vacations with her best friend Alex, starting twelve years ago. Each flashback brings you closer to present day, building the friendship in a delicious, almost maddening slow burn, opposites attract, friends to lovers romance. I wasn't even 1/3rd of the way through and I already wanted to smash their faces together like KISS YOU FOOLS! YOU'RE MADE FOR EACH OTHER!!! GAAAAHHHHH!!!!Let's talk about the main character, Poppy. I love her. I love her in a I-could-keep-reading-books-about-you-for-the-rest-of-your-fictional-life kind of way. There could be a series that just follows Poppy as she grows old and I'd buy every single one and save them in my memory shoebox. She's got this sharp, unapologetic wit to her that's the perfect juxtaposition to the reserved, almost demur Alex. Don't get me wrong, Alex is hilarious in his own right, matching her tit for tat. But it's a humor that he withholds only for his back and forth with Poppy, so you really do feel like you're getting the true ""naked"" (as Poppy would say) Alex, in her company. They have this unmistakable, unique chemistry and their dialogue is FIRE. Honestly, this book had some of the best dialogue I've read in a looooong time. I was cracking up at some of the stuff these two said and thought.The angst is just *chef's kiss*. And also, one bed. One friggin bed. Witty banter, sexual tension, one bed—all my favorite things in the same book???Emily Henry must keep writing. We must protect her at all costs so she can keep giving us new books. This was absolutely my favorite read of the year, and probably one of my favorite books of all time.",5
1346,People We Meet on Vacation,"5.0/5.0 stars""You can love someone and still know the future you’d have with them wouldn’t work for you, or for them, or maybe even for both of you.""Maybe things can always get better between people who want to do a good job loving each other. Maybe that’s all it takes.this book is my comfort book. everything about it is so beautiful, from the characters to the setting. if you were to ever ask me what my all time favorite book is, i would say this onewith no doubt. but if u knew me, you’d already know this. and i’m so glad that hasn’t changed in any way. i have tried writing this review so many times and every single time i’ve been at a loss for words. there’s simply no way to perfectly convey my love for both this book and alexpoppy. i am 100% convinced i sound super cheesy when i’m writing this so i’m warning u rn.I wrote the last one mostly for me. This one’s for you.emily henry really did write this book for me!! in the words of alex and poppy, this bookspeaks to me(iykyk). i’m sure everyone has one book that they resonate with so deeply, and this book is it for me. it’s always hard for me to express my love for a book. i feel like this book was made just for me, and while this book isn’t for everyone, it’s definitely for me. poppyalex are so flawed and those flaws helped create the person that they are. i wouldn’t change them in any way.“That crush of happiness, that feeling thatthisis what life’s about: being somewhere beautiful, with someone you love.”“I love you all the way, Alex,” I say. “I couldn’t have lived with myself if I hadn’t at least told you.”i think the past perfectly showcases how deep their friendship went and it was all the more realistic. i loved the way they bonded in the past, from slow dancing in the streets to having late talks into the night. these chapters talking about the summers they shared were so enjoyable bc it made me love them all the more. god i am so in love with this book. they got off on a rough start, but once they got to know each other and see how different they were, i loved how their friendship blossomed. the way they were willing to be open about the others’ interests and give it a try simply because they were intrigued literally means so much to me. they accepted each other and never once tried to change one another. the love they had for each other was just true unconditional love. (yes that is another reference)‘opposites attract’ is one of my favorite concepts, and this doesn’t just apply to books. the overall idea of being accepted as who you are and learning to love someone even more for their differences is so beautiful. they were two independent people who couldn’t bear to live their lives without one another. it was like they knew they’d be happy as long as they were together. without one another, their world shone a little less bright compared to how they were with each other. living their very best life without a care in the world bc the person they truly loved was there, and it’d be all okay.this is how friends to lovers should be done.the slow progress as they build this deep connection and bond through experiences and memories that they share. the tension between them was just another added factor that i loved. i think that’s why this book resonates so much with me. i don’t want to go into full detail but this book makes me feelunderstood.reading this book the second time around really opens your eyes. i was able to see the parallels within this book that were reflected in the end which i found to be so adorable. the nickname ‘tiny fighter’ was just so cute and the idea that they knew each other so well was just everything. they are the definition ofperfectly flawedcharacters and i have a soft spot in my heart for them. they really took the idea of home being a person and just ran with it. you can’t tell me they don’t exist because i will simply deny this fact. they exist in my mind which is good enough for me.“I loved being in the city, surrounded by art and food and noise and new people, enough that the school part of it was bearable”“Because no matter what makes all those people different, they’re all just trying to get somewhere, waiting to reach someone.”Because I will never again feel as alone as I did during those long nights as a kid. As long as I have him, I will never be alone again.“You’ve always beenPoppy.”slight spoiler warning.poppy. where do i start with her? she’s absolutely amazing. she’s like this ball of energy that had me laughing from the very beginning. she was the definition of lovely (in my completely humble opinion) and she was never afraid to express herself through her eccentric style which i found to be so cute. after going through and putting up with the bullying she suffered in her high school years, i’m so glad she never lost herself. her past was something that she never let define her and it’s clear that she loves her rowdy family despite wanting to “escape” it. however, she was running away from the feeling of being alone rather than the people that she loved. despite her efforts, she was never able to truly run away from it and had to accept that the past was a part of her life to move on. this was character development on both poppy and alex’s part. she had this running fear that she’d never fit in, and that fear was placed onto alex bc of their opposite personalities. i love the idea that he loved her even after seeing all of her. making her feel accepted and loved throughout the years she felt she wasn’t.he’s that person for her.the way she’s unapologetically herself and how alex loves her for it makes my heart warm. i can’t live with myself knowing poppyalex aren’t real.watching poppy fall in love with alex throughout their friendship was honestly so cute. it felt as though i was being taken along on this journey with poppy and i’ve never been so grateful. it’s like being merely a spectator in the world that poppy and alex have created just for themselves. i’ve never wanted to watch anything more in my life. no one and no moment exists other than the one they live in. they only need each other, simply because they see that they are perfect the way they are.i was worried the second time around that i wouldn’t end up liking one pov but it never became a problem. rather, the past made me have a new love for the present bc i understood just how far their bond went. i felt bad bc poppy had this pressure to make this trip seem like the others and how hard it must’ve been for her. the past showed how she felt with alex over all these years they spent but now that she has the chance to fix it, she has this fear that there’s a chance he will slip away again. the present served as a purpose to understand them even further with their thoughts and understandings. the past highlighted their bond, while the present talks about their feelings and the meaning within their little moments that they were still able to maintain despite not talking for 2 years. even if it was awkward, it would never last and they learned to talk it out. communication was the key in the present.“I’ve always felt like once someone sees me deep down, that’s it. There’s something ugly in there, or unlovable, and you’re the only person who’s ever made me feel like I’m okay.” His hand sweeps gently across my face, and I open my eyes, meet his head-on. “There’s nothing scarier than the chance that, once you really have all of me, that changes. But I want all of you, so I’m trying to be brave.”“I’ve never really felt alone since I met you. I don’t think I’ll ever feel truly alien in this world again as long as you’re in it.”listen to me you guys:alex nilsen.the man who carried poppy down a mountain when she was hurt, waited 12 years for her, held her hand bc she loved holding hands even if he hated it, LEFT HIS PLANE BC SHE WAS SICK, AND GOT A VASECTOMY WHEN SHE HAD A PREGNANCY SCARE UNRELATED TO HIM. the list goes on and on. the love he had for her is absolutely incredible. the little snippets of alex’s pov based on how he communicated with her made me want to give him a hug. he spent his life acting like the big brother, the one who had to hold it all together and make everything feel better because of the pressure of being there for everyone. no matter how much burden was put onto alex, he always worried about poppy and i love him so much for that. i love the idea that he was so reserved and only showed his personality in front of her, who brought out the best in him and made him let his guard down to just be himself. even if he looked out for her at times, it’s clear that he knew he could trust her and just have fun in her presence. she has this energy that is just so bright and contagious and perfect. the love he had for poppy was shown in everything he did for her and the way they cared for each other was just beautiful. the thought and ideas put into these characters made them feel so real on another level. they’re the it couple. i cannot begin to describe how perfect they are together.“Im sorry for being so tall”“I’m sorry for being so short”“I like you short,” he says. “Never apologize for being short.”“You are, you know.”“A fighter?” I say.“My home,” he says, and kisses me.We are, I think. We’re home.Maybe that’s why he can handle the public affection. Maybe, like me, when we’re together he feels like no one else is there, like they’re phantoms we dreamed up as set dressing.Even if we never kissed, never said the words outright, we were keeping whole parts of our hearts for each other onlyspoilers from this point onanother thing was the character development. poppy and alex wouldn’t have been the people that they are right now, without learning from their mistakes with their exes. throughout their friendship, they dated other people and it was never as though they waited around for one another. they play it off as this belief that it would never work out. however, finding out that the reason they hesitated to be together for so long stemmed from their own insecurities made me so sad. they couldn’t deny the love that they had for each other and being with other people helped them realize that they were meant to be. not with anyone else but each other.alex thought through everything and cared about poppy so much while they were friends. it was heartbreaking to realize that he never felt as though he was enough bc he felt she deserved the absolute world and he thought he couldn’t give her that. he was so organized and wanted to settle down with his life, in contrast to poppy, who lives her life in a carefree manner and enjoys it in every way she can try. i love that they seemed to be willing to date other people in the span of their friendship, because it allowed them to realize that they really were meant to be and they just had to take that extra step to truly be together happily.i always get the feeling that emily henry’s books are so much more than the blurb lets up on and in this case, it’s true. the croatia trip wasn’t just a trip, it was clarity for both alex and poppy. it solidified alex’s beliefs bc he felt as though poppy played down the fact that it happened and he had to live with that knowledge for so long. i never expected much to come out of that trip simply because there was already so much depth to the characters and to add even more would just be overwhelming. i feel content with the fact that poppy was able to look at the croatia trip from another perspective after everything that went down with alex. she got to understand him and everything that he did all for her.the third act conflict really hits deep in this book! i could physically feel my heart breaking in half for them. i felt like i understood everything within that moment and i’ve never felt so sad. this book isn’t just about the romance, it’s a journey ofself-realizationfor poppy as she figures out for herself how she felt for alex. i think that this built up the angst very well. it’s clear poppy means something to alex and once i understood the miscommunication, it was like i was being betrayed. i felt like i understood where alex stood so well, and i believe that i recognize poppy. everything from her point of view was so confusing because she never really knew how to express her love for him. it was years of pent up love for alex while it took poppy years to fall in love with alex just to realize it would never truly be able to work. to make up for this, she constantly tried dating people that she felt “fit” with her which is the complete opposite of the dynamic between poppy and alex.poppy was the one who held the belief that they would never be good together and never really understood why until the end of the book. it’s the beauty of this book, realizing you have to get over your fears to truly experience life, and love, the way it should be experienced:to the fullest, with the person who is absolutely worth it. in the end, all that mattered was how they felt about one another, and the fact that they held no judgement, only love for each other in the end. they truly deserved their happy ending after being in each others lives for so long and the pain they went through. it just blew my mind how amazing these characters are and how deeply i can relate to each of them. no one will fill they void like they do. i loved that both these characters grew from their past and learned to love each other the way they did. their character development was absolutely beautiful and i am so glad that they got their happily ever after. i am never getting over this book and the pain that comes with the experience. emily henry, i would like to truly thank you for this.pre-reviewthis book has changed my brain chemistry in the best way possible and i want to hold on to this feeling forever. rtc <3pre-read reviewidk a better way to prepare myself for happy place other than to reread one of my comfort books 🧘‍♀️",5
1347,People We Meet on Vacation,"People We Meet on Vacationby Emily Henry (Author), Julia Whelan (Narrator)I always say I'm not good at Rom/Com because I'm not. I can't identify with the formula (as my friend Jayme mentioned) of most Rom/Coms. It's as if two people who might be right for each other, despite how different they might be, have to manufacture over the top drama to keep them apart. We have a lot of that in this story. I did enjoy it but, at the same time, the drama is too silly for words yet these too people allow it to keep them apart for over ten years. This is where I roll my eyes, again.What I liked about the story:Alex, yes yes, he is supposed to be so boring that his boring (according to Poppy) yoga loving on and offish girlfriend thinks he's boring, but I thought he was funny and interesting.The friendship between Alex and Poppy, which seems real.One of my favorite narrators.What I didn't like:Poppy seems very immature and indecisive and I doubt she ever changes.Alex needed to develop a backbone. (I can't believe something that he does that may not be able to be reversed).That the resolution really is ignoring some big problems that have not changed.In the end, these two people deserve all the misery they they create for themselves. The journey was enjoyable to a certain extent but I can only take such a journey a few times a year. So 3.5 stars rounded to a Rom/Com 4 stars.Pub: May 11th 2021 by Penguin Audio",4
1348,People We Meet on Vacation,"3.75⭐️ I liked this better thanbook lovers,beach readandhappy placeput together 🤭I'd have enjoyed it even more if I were on vacation and got Alex's pov 😣💖💖“Oh,” I say, realization dawn “So, like . . . a woman.” Again he holds my gaze, as if daring me to push the matter. But I don’t blink, and he cracks first. “We don’t have to talk about this.” “Oh.” And now all that vibrating excited energy seems to be freezing over, sinking low in my stomach. “So it’s Sarah.

They are both very relatable and funny and quirky (well, if you discount Poppy's questionable personal hygiene 👀)- grumpy X sunshine and friends-to-lovers worked really well for their story. Also, I see Emily Henry has a thing for her fmcs paying hefty student loans for a degree they aren't going to use 😭😭 what's that about?With regards to my y/n, this book didn't provide much in the way of answers which is no surprise but at some points I felt very intuned with the mcs emotions and I didn't feel alone. 🥺♥️It didn't feel like much of a romcom (a bit too realistic), I think I probably liked this so much because I could relate to the friends to lovers situation and I like traveling too.***🚨 emergency reading 🚨I know, I know ✋🏽😭 I swore that I'm staying away from Emily Henry and I put her on my 2023 blacklist no one cares about but me 😌😤plusI said I was back in my fantasy era *sighs*my little angel 🧡convinced me that this read would give me perspective for my y/n friends to *cough cough* love interests situation irl so here I am 🤷🏽‍♀️wish me luck 🤞🏼🙃",4

1352,The Inmate,"4.0 stars— Everytime I research top thrillers on Kindle Unlimited there are numerous books with thousands of great ratings for Freida McFadden. So, I decided to read her newest book, “The Inmate”, and I have to admit it wasn’t half bad. The book begins with Brooke Sullivan starting her new job as a nurse practitioner in a maximum security prison. It happens to be the same prison where the person who was convicted of attempting to kill her and who is also the father of her 10 year old son resides. The author does a great job of interweaving the new interactions with baby daddy, Shane, with the events that led to his conviction and incarceration. As the author introduces new characters, it becomes obvious very quickly the path the book is taking for final resolution. In fact, about 1/4 of the way in I felt confident I could guess the ending. However, to the author’s credit, I was wrong and enjoyed the unexpected twists and turns the author used to finish the story. Were there numerous obvious red herrings? Yes. Did the author use many of the obvious cliches in thriller books such as storms, no cell service, impassable roads etc? Yes again. However, much like some of the summer blockbuster movies I enjoyed over the years, if you don’t over analyze and just go where the author leads you, the book was entertaining. I know many of you might disagree and call this book fluff, but I believe some books (and movies) are fast paced and entertaining enough to be worth reading. I definitely will be back for more of Ms. McFadden’s intriguing books.",4
1353,The Inmate,**3.5 Stars**Interesting read. The twists at the end just didn't have that impact it needed.,3
1354,The Inmate,"Ughh! It was entertaining but...Brooke Sullivan is a nurse practitioner at a maximum security prison where Shane Nelson, her ex-boyfriend and the baby daddy to her ten-year-old son, Josh is incarcerated for life. Eleven years ago at seventeen, she and her best friend Tim Reese testified that Shane killed their three friends and attempted to strangle her although she never saw who it was. To this day, Shane insisted that he is innocent and to watch out for Tim.Brooke is now dating Tim! Can she trust Tim? She knew him since they were kids but did he lie? Maybe Shane is telling the truth. Did she help put her son's father in prison? Ughh!!🙄I admit I switch back and forth a few times about the killer, but I figured out who the killer was before Brooke did. I got pretty frustrated with Brooke to put it mildly. The last chapter was unexpected and kinda cool, I liked it so it's a solid 3 stars.",3
1355,The Inmate,"★1 starThe plot?Weak.The protagonist?Dumb.The writing?Reads like a YA.Oh Lord, I wanted to like this so bad.It started out okay. I had high hopes. It was good until Brooke started using her brain all the time.This book would 100% be better if she doesn't think too much so she doesn't confuse everyone.Even she manages to confuse herself, if you can believe it.All themaybe he isn’t—,maybe I should be—,maybe I should just—, I can't. Brooke why are you doing this to yourself.I honestly feel for Brooke. Being treated the way that she did in the aftermath of the murders, it was really hard for her. Standing up to her parents after being shunned by them and raising a child on her own, that takes courage. Being woken up by the same strangled-by-your-own-necklace nightmare, that takes a toll on your mental health. Losing your friends and witnessing their deaths, that kind of trauma carries through. The triggers, they linger. Even more so, the memories, they stay with you.However ...Explain it to me, if Brooke was still so traumatized by the events from 10 years ago, how was she not repulsed by the sight of Shane in her patient room? She believed Shane strangled her yet she was practically restless and swooning upon seeing him.Oh my shirt was hanging a little low and my cleavage was showing! Nah, it's fine, he prolly don't see much boobs in here. —Are you kidding me?!Explain to me, how, if Shane was murdering upstairs, you smelled sandalwood on your strangler? Or that the strangler felt heavy and bulky on you? Is this a case of an 'unreliable memory' after a traumatic event? Or is this a case of dumb teenager in the wild?Explain to me how Tim never recognized the baby sitter as the one who sold him the necklace? Or how, given Tim's love for Brooke, would he gift her a broken necklace on her birthday no less?!A broken necklace?! On her birthday?! Are you kidding me?!There has been far too many issues to dismiss. The reason for the murder is so bad. Are we really going to buy that a life-sentence can be overturned that easily? Or that a correctional facility would hire someone associated with a prisoner even if they were that desperate?Brooke was written too dumb for this to be remotely enjoyable.Another idiot-driven plot. Actually, I'm beginning to think McFadden writes the dumbest protagonists — women who are helpless and can hardly think for themselves.I had picked this up because my feed is just swamped with McFadden recommendations. Every McFadden read of mine is not good so far, so I'm now on a hunt for a McFadden thriller that's actuallythrillingto disabuse me of this notion that she writes thrillers for bored teens.Plot: ★Writing: ★",1
1356,The Inmate,"I read some reviews before I started on the book, so I was prepared for not being impressed by the main character. Like some wrote, she just didn’t seem very intelligent, an observation I found apt. The naïve actions were sometimes cringeworthy, I just wish she would have reflected a bit more about who she trusted and how fast she changed direction. The twist was interesting although not totally convincing. The book didn’t need the last twist, in my opinion.",3
1357,The Inmate,"Oh good grief. This was just silly. It started off pretty good but quickly became outlandish. The MC was TSTL, even while being a NP. The twist was just ridiculous and too farfetched. I would have to believe way too many coincidences happened to put this foolery into motion. I'll admit, I did not see it coming.",2

1361,The Inmate,"I wanted to like this book - and it had me, in the first half. That's the only reason it gets a star instead of me just deleting it from my memory entirely.But damn, did it get unreasonable quick. First of all, the idea that so many people can be accused of this one crime before someone starts questioning Brooke's sanity is laughable. Not to mention, this author clearly was not taking into account the length of time it takes for quite literally anything to move in the criminal justice system. There's no WAY Brooke simply recanting her testimony gets this man out of prison TEN YEARS after conviction??Also, some of the plot points were just insane. Margie/Pamela helps her kid murder all of these people over the span of ELEVEN years and then just casually gives it all up just because her son died? When the grandson is still alive???And why even bother murdering Hunt? Just to open the door to make Brooke realize Shane is an issue? With the way this book went, it almost would've been better for her not to suspect anything at all and get ambused.The POV change in the epilogue made it even worse for me - first of all, the kid sounded much younger than 10 by the way it was written, in my opinion. But then he casually confesses to killing someone? HUH???I wanted to like this. The premise of it was promising. But it went downhill so fast I got whiplash.",1
1362,The Inmate,"Brooke is a fairly new Nurse Practitioner. And she finally landed a new position. Not a job she particularly wanted. But hey, it’s the only one she could find. So for now it will have to do.Did I mention it’s at the local penitentiary? Pretty tough in itself, but there’s more. It’s also where her first boyfriend Shane is currently serving his sentence. And it just keeps getting better…he was convicted of murdering her friends and trying to kill her! Talk about an unpleasant work environment!Shane has always claimed he was innocent and is now concerned the real killer will come after Brooke once again.This was an intriguing thriller that I truly thought I had figured out from the beginning! Nope! Not even close!I listened to the audio version and the narrator did a great job! This was my first 🎧 by Freida McFadden and I am already searching for more of her works!Thank you to my local library via Hoopla.🎧",4
1363,The Inmate,"The end fizzled again!Too many unbelievable coincidences and uninvestigated happenings!I had the ebook from KU and the audio from Hoopla.It started off well and I liked the protag, Brooke and the prison setting. I could almost hear the prison doors slamming at Raker Maximum Penitentiary where Brooke is a new nurse practioner. She has a connection to an inmate that she is hiding, but it won't take long to come out.The narration made it good enough to finish, but I wouldn't recommend.Narrated by Leslie Howard/ 8 hours 5 min",3

1365,The Inmate,"This was just weak…A very loose plot, too many coincidences, a dumb protagonist, this whole book would have not existed if Brooke just used two of her brain cellsHow come she comes back to the very place she left ten years ago and not expect to meet people she knows, how did she know she’ll be working in the prison facility where her ex was and not prepare herself, and just “ blurt out” stuff the second he looks at her?!How do the police work in that town, do they just keep relying on whatever Brooke tells them, they haven’t thought of investigationg any of the murders further?!The motive is also quite weak for such a killing frenzy, and the fact that no one recognised you know who is too far fetched, I can swallow an unrealistic occurrence or two, but not when every plot twist is based on ridiculous omissions and coincidences.",1
1366,The Inmate,"i never thought it was possible for a thriller book to be corny until this. everyone is so fucking dumb and brooke cannot think for herself! first of all, if she really is traumatized and reacts badly from even the small details, why doesnt seeing shane scare tf out of her and even being in the town where it all happened ? shes so stupid and she gives me that pick me girl vibes. also how tf is josh, a 10 year old who showed no comprehension of anything and acts and is being treated like a 5 year old, able to kill a grown man? that’s so farfetched it’s corny. i was going to give this book a higher rating when brooke thought tim was on it and i liked that idea. then she was wrong like brooke u only had one job ! and wtf is i lope you?",1
1367,The Inmate,"Wow, this book was awful. I honestly didn’t finish it, just skipped to the end because I couldn’t stand listening to Brooke whine. It was the most convoluted nonsense from start to finish. The first red flag was kids in Queens bullying her son because she was an unwed mother except this isn’t set in 1742. Literally no one cares about that and the constant whining about it got very old quickly. Also, red flag two, what kind of moron returns to her home town in her childhood home after a very public trial but thinks no one will recognize her??? Third final red flag, maybe tell your kid the truth about his parentage or at least a better one than “I’m not going to tell you about your father because I’m stupid.” Jeez, this book was awful.",1
1368,The Inmate,"Naaaah this author isn’t for me. I was really looking forward to this story because of the prison aspect, but it was just naive Brooke and her stupidness and almost no prison time. I really struggled to finish this book unfortunatly. 2* because Freida is very talented, but her books don’t appeal to me.",2
1369,The Inmate,"This was the very definition of a popcorn thriller. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It was a fun distraction and as long as I turned off my brain, I enjoyed going along for the ride on this one. And trust me, turning off your brain is a must. Not just to accept some fairly implausible things, but because our protagonist Brooke also seems to not possess a brain. In order for the book to happen, Brooke needs to make the dumbest decision possible at every turn, and she certainly does not disappoint. I will say that Brooke is *consistently* stupid, which might sound like a complaint but actually I appreciated the fact that it seemed like a true character trait. In so many of these books we have characters who are portrayed as otherwise clever or competent, but who make dumb decisions simply to help the plot along.There was also quite a bit of telling instead of showing. Readers are not as dumb as poor Brooke, we don’t need to be told many times, by multiple characters, that Shane is manipulative. Trust your reader enough to wonder for themselves if he’s putting on an act or not.Despite that, I listened to this in a day. I needed to know what happened in that farm house. I’ve seen a lot of reviews for this one that say this is one of the weaker entries in McFadden’s catalogue, so I will likely be picking up another one and hoping for the best the next time I’m in the mood for popcorn.Major spoilers/discussion on the extreme similarly to another work to follow:I wonder if Freida McFadden is a big fan of the Scream franchise? The similarities between Shane’s mother and Mrs. Loomis inScream 2are, well, striking. Not just the bonkers insane mother avenging her (murderous and terrible) son for “wrongs” his ex-girlfriend supposedly committed against him, but ALL of it. Please note this section will also spoilScreamandScream 2if you haven’t seen them.Both works involve affairs between the parents of main characters. InThe Inmate, Brooke’s father had an affair with Shane’s mother. InScream, Sidney’s mother had an affair with Billy Lommis’ father.Both Shane and Billy date the daughters of the people their parents had an affair with and then attempt to kill them, but only right after deflowering them, of course. And rather than just kill the daughters (Brooke and Sidney), they go ahead and up the body count because hey, why not?Brooke had met Shane’s mother when they were dating, just as Sidney knew who Mrs. Loomis was. But both mothers managed to change their appearances enough to successfully pull off altering their identities to get close to the main characters years later (nanny here versus a reporter inScream 2). Side note: seriously, no one noticed or commented on the fact that Brooke was letting the mother of the man she sent to prison for attempting to murder her babysit her child. No one???Both women set someone else up to take the fall for murders in the current timeline (Tim, Timothy Olyphant’s character Mickey) and there was intent to frame someone for the original murders as well (Tim, Cotton and Sidney’s father).Even before the big reveal, when Brooke thought Shane and Tim were in on the original murders together, it gave a strong originalScreamvibe (Billy and Stu). Right down to intending to give each other superficial injuries to look like innocent victims. And for a while the reader was supposed to wonder if Shane was really innocent, sent to prison by Brooke’s damning testimony. Just like inScream, where Cotton Weary was wrongly convicted in large part due to Sidney’s testimony.While I’ve rewatched the original Scream multiple times, I saw the sequel twice at most, maybe 15 or 20 years ago now (yikes, that makes me feel old to type out). That is how striking the similarity here is, to immediately remind me of a movie/character I haven’t seen or thought of in years. Margie/Pamela simplyisMrs. Loomis.It’s nearly impossible to write anything *truly* original, but any impact the ending should have had for me was ruined by just how nearly identical it was to the movie franchise mentioned in my spoiler portion. The epilogue was also veeeeery reminiscent of a thriller that had a ton of buzz surrounding its epilogue last year. (It involved planes… if you know, you know)",3
1370,The Inmate,"Please Lord, give me the strength to never listen to this type of book again. Just plain embarrassingly AWFUL!Here’s an example of why I feel this way: as our heroine is down in the basement of the man she has been warned numerous times is dangerous and could be a killer, she finds the two high heeled shoed feet sticking out of a rolled tarp (at this point we know that this man’s ex girlfriend has gone missing). So what does our brilliant heroine say to herself?“Has Tim rolled up a mannequin?” 🤦‍♀️",1
1371,The Inmate,I would have got away with it if it wasn’t for those meddling kids….,3
1372,The Inmate,"After seeing so many positive reviews for Frieda McFadden’s books and with a bit of spare time on my hands I thought I would see what all the fuss was about.Overall, this was a pretty exciting story. Told in both the past (11 years ago) and the present by our narrator, Brooke Sullivan. She was 17 years old when she was invited to a party at her boyfriend, Shane Nelson’s house. His mother was going to be away and three couples were going to be there. It was to be Brooke’s “first time”. Well that did happen but the rest of the night was a nightmare! Three of the young people were stabbed to death and the Brooke was being strangled from behind with her own necklace. At the time she was convinced it was her boyfriend Shane who tried to kill her. Shane and Brooke’s childhood friend Tim Reese, both survived with injuries. It was Brooke’s testimony that sent Shane to prison.Now, 11 years later she has a 10 year old son, Josh, and is returning to her home town of Raker following the death of her parents in a car accident. She is a nurse practitioner but the only job she could find was at the prison where Shane is serving his sentence. Awkward. Of course he needed her services pretty quickly after being beaten up again. She tries to remain professional but Shame pleads his innocence most convincingly.Meanwhile Brooke soon runs into Tim again and they restart their friendship and it slowly turns to romance. Then the unthinkable happens and suddenly Brooke is not sure any more about who attacked her that night. She didn’t actually see them but the attacker was wearing Shane’s signature aftershave.This is where it gets really interesting. When you think it’s going to zig, the plot zags! I really felt for Brooke. She was such a sweet person, trying to be the best mother to her son and do the right thing generally. I don’t think she made dumb decisions but she was seriously manipulated. There was quite some suspense in the story, my only quibble is about the very end and, of course, I can’t describe why. Overall - a very good story though.",4
1373,The Inmate,"Oh my goodness. The amount of times I wanted to smack Brooke for how dumb she was acting, is way more than I can count. She was “certain” about so many things then changed her mind on the next page! She just wasn’t a very strong character but we were supposed to believe she was… it was hard for me to finish because of her.However, I didn’t see the ending coming. I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not because it kind of came out of left field. I enjoy when the reader has a chance to try and understand who the killer or criminal is with clues, but this was so random and not super well written.",2
1374,The Inmate,"This is my first read from this author, from the cover and description I thought it was more about the prison..it tells Brooke story from the past and present day.This book when I was reading it felt abit unbelievable and unrealistic but I couldnt put this book down as wanted to know what was going to happen next..Brooke works in a mens prison as a practitioner nurse she knew she would see her ex boyfriend in there and the story of the past comes to light..was he guilty or innocent...a different read which I did enjoy and still to read a couple of her books on my kindle..",4
1375,The Inmate,"The ending genuinely made this book 4 stars holy shat. This was such an easy and fast paced book. I couldn’t put it down, the storyline was so gripping and every page had you guessing what would happen. I guessed 12 possible outcomes and the ending sure tied this entire story together. Freida is the thriller queen 🙌!!! Def recommend if you are in a slump because this will for sure get you out of it!",4

This wouldn’t have been her first choice of jobs…but it was all that was available. Brooke is a single mum with a ten-year-old son, Josh.Dorothy, the head nurse in charge, and in charge of dispensing medications, explains the three rules to follow at the men’s maximum-security prison. They include:1) Treat all prisoners with respect.2) Never reveal any personal information.3) Never EVER become too friendly with the inmates.But Nobody knows that Brooke has a secret…her past connection to Shane Nelson, one of the penitentiary’s most dangerous inmates. Shane was Brooke’s high school sweetheart, who is now spending the rest of his life in prison for a series of horrific murders. and it was Brooke’s testimony that sent him to jail.How would Brooke guard her secret, and work in this environment?This was a well-written gripping thriller with an ending I didn’t see coming.",4

I’ll never feel about anyone else the way I feel about you”.“I could cry. It’s the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. Tim is so sweet and sexy and he’s great to my kid. I should be throwing myself into his arms, and just thank my lucky stars”.“But for some reason, I can’t turn off Shane Nelson‘s voice inside my head”.“Stay away from Tim Reese. He’s dangerous”.“Please, Brooke”.“When I testified against Shane, I felt so certain he was the one tightening that necklace chain around my neck, trying to kill me.

One little detail that has escaped me”.“I’m sure of it”.Who takes a job at a place where one of the inmates is a man who tried to murder you?Brooke does.“NOT HALF BAD”….I now ‘fully’ understand when readers say that“this was a very fast pace read”….YEP…. it’s speedy alright — I actually guessed one aspect of the story early on — but not the full extent of it…Great literary literature? Of course not.Pulls you in and for whatever reason is engaging —(some context silliness with a questionable content?) Yes!But all in good escape fun!!This thriller was a great pallet cleanser—I’d do this author again — purely for the twisty-turning - brain break .As my friend Joey said …. “It wasn’t half bad”.",4
1379,The Inmate,"Rating: 2.5 🌟🌟💫Freida McFadden is one of my favorite thriller writers. Her books are fun, fast paced, twisty, sometimes over the top but for me just always a good read.Unfortunately, “The Inmate” was very disappointing. One of my very biggest book pet peeves is the writer making the main character a complete idiot. Not sweetly naive or a bit slow on the uptake but the plot will ONLY work if this person is the single dumbest person ever to take a breath. Meet Brooke Sullivan… the single dumbest person to ever take a breath. She reminded of the characters in that commercial who run into the dark shed and hide behind the chainsaws instead of escaping in the car.So, despite this book not being a fave I’m still all in on reading more by McFadden, this one just didn’t do it for me. But, you should read it if only so you can come find me and we can talk about how dumb Brooke is. 😅",2
1380,The Inmate,"The last chapter and the epilogue of this book, produced a true jaw-dropping gob-smacked exclamation of “WOW” from my lips. I’m not kidding.The story goes back and forth from 10 yrs past to the present, and repeats that cycle throughout the book as details and conversations emerge. Six teenagers got together at Brooke’s boyfriend Brandon’s house, to spend the night (3 boys - 3 girls) on this particular night. It was dark and stormy, terrible rain, no electricity, no phone service, and then…there were 3 murders with an attempt on Brooke’s life that someone tried strangling her with her necklace, but she got away from the attacker. The other 2 victims of this party were injured too, one clobbered in the head with a baseball bat, the other stabbed with a knife in the stomach.Fast forward 10 yrs. On that night, Brooke conceived a child, a son named Josh from Brandon. Brandon happens to be the boy she put in prison by aid of her testimony. She believed Brandon committed this horrendous crime of 10 yrs ago and was the one who tried to kill her too. She has never told Josh who his father was.So now, the 3 lives of the “survivors” intersect in the present. Brooke is a nurse practitioner who is desperate for work and can only find a job in a all men’s penitentiary, the exact same one where Brandon is. Tim who was present also on that fatal night, and who was her childhood best friend, her first practice kiss, and now her son’s school principal, renews his friendship with Brooke and the more than casual interest that he had in her…( he claims he has always loved her).Fingers are pointing galore! The two men hate each other and each tells her to be weary of the other. Along the lines, Brooke really gets confused. She begins to wonder if her testimony put the right man in jail. She’s sure of it, and then she’s not. She never did saw the actual face of the one who tried to kill her all those years ago! She never saw the murderer that night at all, the one who killed her friends. Was she right about Brandon? Wrong about Tim? Things are really confusing about both their present behaviors and the details of their personalities and present actions.I so thought I had this figured out. (I’m usually not wrong very often), but I was so wrong - hence refer to my first sentence.Kudo’s to the author for writing a brilliant story WITHOUT foul-language. 👍👍 I found some of the story a little repetitive through parts, but the story itself was overall fascinating and engaging and I needed to see this confusion resolved.First time reading this author, but won’t be the last.This gets 5 shiny STARS ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5
1381,The Inmate,"It’s easy to see why Freida McFadden is a popular author. Her books are fast-paced, they keep the reader intrigued and the twists are so well done that they leave the reader speechless. What more could a reader need in a thriller novel?This book had all the things I have mentioned. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. Was it my favourite book by this author no, but I still really enjoyed it. Yes, some readers will say it was overdone in parts and I would agree, but it didn’t matter I continued to turn the pages racing to the end waiting for the twists and to see how it would be wrapped up and I can honestly say I was not disappointed at all.

It is gloriously long and kept me occupied for an entire day (night hours included) making me crave to find out more, but also stop reading so that the book won't end just yet.You think you know Celaena from reading the first two books, right? Oh, but you're so so wrong. In this book we see her more than broken, relentlessly blaming herself for the fates and deaths of her beloved ones. She takes down her every shield, leaving nothing behind to shed her emptiness threatening to shatter her from the inside out. I believe this was her turning point, the true crossroad in her life, making her see, accept and embrace all that pain, regret and self-loathing she carefully kept hidden inside her soul, etched into her dire and gruesome memories.“You collect scars because you want proof that you are paying for whatever sins you've committed. And I know this because I've been doing the same damn thing for two hundred years. Tell me, do you think you will go to some blessed Afterworld, or do you expect a burning hell? You're hoping for hell--because how could you face them in the Afterworld?”And gods, what memories and past. We are able to witness how she became Celaena Sardothien, how her life changed forever on that fateful night ten years ago. But by facing all that sorrow and darkness, she's making a stand. She's slowly becoming a queen, one more powerful and deadlier that you could ever imagine.Her character development is phenomenal, because through her new experiences she is stronger, wiser and more determined. Her fierceness was awe-inspiring and I loved that she's still the same stubborn, snarky and brave young woman, maybe with her ego a little bruised. She's not proud of who she's become, abandoning her kingdom and not fighting for rebuilding it for the past ten years, but she's ready to throw herself into battle to win back her land. To say that she's badass would be an understatement.Celaena makes the transition from assassin to queen with the help of Rowan, a Fae Prince and my favorite new addition to the series. Not that he is so eager to help, but in order to find answers about the Wyrdkeys and how to destroy them, she has to be worthy of entering Doranelle, the land where Queen Maeve awaits her to answer her questions. May I shout something?I LOVE ROWAN WHITETHORN. In the beginning, he's infuriatingly patient and stubborn, brooding and secretive. But when he opens up? And when he actuallysmiles?!?Laughs?? Scrap me off the floor cause I am hyperventilating.“Gods, he was brilliant. Cunning and wicked and brilliant.Even when he beat the hell out of her. Every. Damn. Day.”He's an alpha-male in all his glory, with the kickass moves that would bring Celaena's to shame. He's scary and intense, protective and defying, caring, but lethal when it comes to his enemies. Rowan is the no-nonsense type and I was glad there is finally someone who doesn't put up with Celaena's bullshit. She throws a verbal punch? He throws one that will leave her with a black eye for the entire week. But they develop a friendship and something so important on the intimate level (not talking about romance) that it will warm your heart to realize that our girl finally has someone to fully rely on. No secrets, no barriers, no judging left between them. They would die for each other, kill for each other, fight for each other. And when they work together, as a pair, as a team, they're astounding and terrifying.“I claim you, Rowan Whitethorn. I don't care what you say and how much you protest. I claim you as my friend.”Dorian Havilliard is the same swoon-worthy, sentimental, humble (yet a bit arrogant as well) young prince. He will win your heart regardless of the ""team"" you're in, because in the end he stands up to his father in a glorious way that had me cheering for him. He is way more mature, weary of everyone and everything and you can see him becoming a true worthy king right before your eyes. A lot of heartbreak and despair was in store for him and I guarantee it will all leave you in a pile of overwhelming feels.In addition to his wonderful character development, Dorian is moving on from Celaena. And I'm not sure I like who he's moving on with. Heck, I don't like that he's actually moving on. Makes the whole Dorian/Celaena shipping a bit harder. But truth be told now, as much as I was against his new lady Sorscha, I was glad he got a little happiness and support to fight his growing loneliness, worries and magic. And you want to know why? Because freaking Chaol Westfall pretty much abandoned his friend when he needed him the most.Yeah, you read that right. Dedicated, loyal, selfless Chaol was so unable to make up his damn mind that I was uncounsciously pulling my hair. I was very much irritated with him until the very end when he came to his senses. In the aftermath ofCrown of Midnight, his friendship with Dorian is left in shambles and things don't get prettier in this book. They grow estranged, but I'll give it to the captain that he has only the prince's safety and freedom in interest. But keeping secrets, judging, not being able to accept Celaena's and Dorian's powers -- all these things make me wonder if he has any shot left at our heroine's heart, because whereas Celaena would always pick him, Aelin would not.“As for Celaena,” he said again, “ you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.”We meet awesome warrior Aedion Ashryver, Celaena's cousin and childhood best friend. He's all deadly smiles, muscles and wild behavior. Aedion is daring, clever and doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself. Or so they say. But he's dead set on taking down the King of Adarlan from the inside. When he finds out Aelin is alive, he makes it clear that he would move mountains in order to see his true queen back in Terrasen. He's loyal, determined, skilled and I hope he reunites with Celaena sooner rather than later, because he is in a pretty bad place at the end of the book.""A cry went up from the witches, save for the Thirteen—¬who stayed cool and quiet. They did not need to cheer, for they ¬were immortal and infinite and gloriously, wonderfully deadly.”Another addition to the newbie characters is Manon Blackbeak, heir of the Blackbeak coven of the Ironteeth witches and leader of the Thirteen. The witches play a big role in the King's newest and darkest plans by being the riders of the wyverns he has created and Manon wants nothing more than to lead them into battle as Wing Leader. She wants to prove herself and although she is a bloodthirsty, wicked creature, I completely loved her. She's by no means a villain, just a different kind of heroine, firm and unyielding, with great ambition. Her encounters and silent dialogues with Abraxos cracked me up, because in that moments you could glimpse (besides the wyvern's total awesomeness) how Manon starts believing there's a chance she has a heart and soul and that her grandmother's rules might not be the best to follow.“Witches didn't need blood to survive, but humans didn't need wine, either.”The King of Adarlan is still the biggest bastard I've had the (dis)pleasure of reading. I loathe the guy with every fiber of my being. He is wicked to the core, manipulative and selfish to no end. No, not just selfish, but greedy. Greedy for everything and anything, exactly like a monster. And what he did at the end, to my poor baby Dorian, made me wish that once Celaena comes back -- because she will come back -- she won't kill him. Oh no, I want her to keep him locked in a basement, to visit him everyday and torture him until he breaks, only to do it all over again the next day, because killing him would be too much of a mercy for the deeds he has done.The other secondary characters were very well developed: the Ironteeth witches, Ren Allsbrook, Emrys, Luca and Maeve -- they were a testimony to SJM's awesome writing skills. And I might add that for me the writing style was slightly different. Improved. Better. More realistic, if you wish. There was a certain ease with which she used words that enchanted you completely. Plus, the swearing. I don't mind it one bit, but am I the only one that noticed it appeared more often than in the first two books? Matured characters, matured world, matured language, I guess.The atmosphere is darker and the pace is thrilling, allowing you to breath for a bit before another near-death encounter or epic battle starts. The world-building was another winner, as we were able to see Wendlyn, Doranelle, the Ferien Gap and Adarlan again. We learn about the past, we meet Queen Maeve (who's quite a manipulative bitch), we run from terrifying creatures and we accompany Celaena as she masters her powers.There isn't so much romance in the air, besides Dorian's plotline, because it's the last thing in our character's mind. And honestly, I don't really know who Celaena is going to end up with. Chaol still has issues with her and Dorian is currently viewing her as his friend, but things could still drastically change since there are 3 more books. It seems that even Aedion, her cousin, might have a shot since he wouldn't deny anything his queen would ask of him. And then there's Rowan who I'm not sure will actually have a romantic involvement with Aelin, but it's worth hoping for -- they would be unstoppable.“He would not apologize for today, or yesterday, or for any of it. And she would not ask him to, not now that she understood that in the weeks she had been looking at him it had been like gazing at a reflection. No wonder she had loathed him.”In terms of plot, you could say it's action-driven, but I beg to differ: the character development plays a part as big as the twists and turns and fights. It sure keeps you at the edge of your seat, courtesy of Sarah J. Mass' amazing writing, and makes you shudder at some new evil creatures or at the violence, but I basically viewHeir of Fireas Celaena's healing journey, one necessary to fully accept her legacy.“So you’d save another land, but not yours. Why can’t your friend save her own kingdom?”“Because she is dead!” She screamed the last word so loudly it burned in her throat. “Because she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!”TheThrone of Glassseries slowly becomes a younger version ofGame of Thrones(with less deaths, but keep in mind that there are worse fates than death...) and I couldn't be happier. With the same complexity, a gut-wrenching intensity and an amazing world,Heir of Firebrings out the big guns: twists, emotional punches, tearjerkers and amazing characters, not to mention the wonderfully built world. It's definitely the best one from the series yet and a total game-changer, so don't be surprised if it will keep you enthralled from start to finish. Fantasy to its finest, a story with heroes and monsters, Fae and humans, life and death. Read it the second it hits shelves, cause you won't be disappointed (unless you're the type that can't stomach the idea of enduring another year for the next book and to whom I recommend waiting a bit longer, because there is one hell of a cliff-hanger).If you're looking for anything ToG related then check out thisThrone of Glass fansite.ENJOY!<3",5
1383,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"I'm not sure what to say aboutHeir of Fire. Perhaps I don't need to say anything beyond:it took memonthsto read it.And I am the kind ofcrazypassionate reader that finishes good books in a day or two. It's been a while since a book took me longer than a week to read.So basically:I liked but had issues withThrone of Glass.I absolutely LOVEDCrown of Midnight.But this book... this book was so... bloody... sloooooowwwwwww.I wanted to DNF it so bad. I kept moving it between my ""currently reading"" and ""on hold"" shelves. I kept wondering if I could possibly just skip the last two thirds of this book and somehow pick the story up in next installment (I was informed that I could not). I have invested so much time and love in this series and these characters that I simply had to make myself finish... but holy shit, it was such a struggle.The majority of this book?So Maas tries to experiment with a bit of something different here and it neither a) works, nor b) fills me with much confidence for the state of the rest of the series. I'm seeing the way this whole thing is going...Book one was fantasy-lite with a simplistic plot, filled with characters lacking in any real development to distinguish them from others in the genre, but it was fast-paced, sugary entertainment. Book two cranked it up several notches; here the characters became more fleshed out and nuanced, the plot was equally engaging but more complex and clever, and there was way more badassery. No complaints at all. And then we arrive at book three.Heir of Firefeels like an attempt to be more sophisticated. It is well-written, contains several stories told through constantly changing POVs, and it is more than a hundred pages longer. And it is far far slower. Maas sacrifices everything deliciously fast-paced and compelling about her series in the first half so we can be introduced to a whole new cast of characters we don't care about, be taken through different (all boring) perspectives, and emerge feeling like we've read an extremely long filler book.Dorian's new romance only served to remind me why I found him unbearably boring in the first book. Celaena - now in Wendlyn - meets a whole set of new people who failed to make any kind of impression on me. Even Chaol - whom I absolutely loved in both other books - lost his charm somewhere amid his own boring plot line. And just when I thought I might be starting to get invested in one of the stories, the chapter would end and I would leave the story of interest for at least fifty pages, guaranteeing that I would no longer care when we finally returned.The most annoying thing about this book is how it wasn't even consistently slow. We'd get tiny little tidbits of awesome that would last a mere two or three pages and I would sit up a bit straighter and think ""This is it. Finally we're getting to the good stuff..."" until I realised it was just a false alarm and the story was still boring.If I'm to give credit where it's due, I will say that I like the way Maas portrays friendships and makes them as important - if not more important - than the romantic relationships. It's an area of YA so often neglected and I find it especially refreshing to see a platonic relationship between young male and female characters crafted so well.I will be reading the next book just because I have to give it a shot, but my expectations have been significantly lowered.Blog|Leafmarks|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr",2
1384,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),This is going to be a book that I will constantly be thinking about until I'm able to get my hands on the next book. It was incredible and I'm so happy with the way this story is evolving. NOW GIVE ME QUEEN OF SHADOWS.(full video review coming soooooon),5
1385,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),even more obsessed with this world the second time round,5
1386,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺*stares blankly in space trying to think a way of living life now after this book destroyed me*I just don’t even know what can I say about this book. It’s like everything I try to say gets validated and discarded at the same time. It feels frustrating and I am still not going to cope with it any time soon.It is alwaysveryhard for me to write reviews for theThrone of Glassbooks. I mean, it is somehow impossible. I thoughtCrown of Midnightwas hard to write, but holy gods, I think this one beat it (I don’t even want to think in how many ways the rest of the series is going to murder me).A very important part of this book is Rowan Whitethorn, a Fae warrior prince who will initially seem the most obnoxious creature on earth, but until the end of this book, you’ll fall completely in love with him. His harshness and heart of stone are only the veils that cover Rowan’s true spirit – a gentle spirit; an honourable man with a true sense of loyalty.„Loyalty is earned, not given.”Another important part of the book is the apparition of Aelin’s long lost cousin, general Aedion Ashryver. His unshakable loyalty for his beloved cousin made him do atrocious things in the past ten years, but he still believes in Aelin’s return and is ready to sacrifice anything and everything to help her reign over her people, freeing them all, saving their lives.And if you thought I was done with important parts, you’re awfully wrong. There is yet another very important part of the book and that is the magnificent appearance of the Ironteeth witch Manon Blackbeak. I don’t know how this happened, maybe I am the only one, maybe I am the one of the few, maybe the one of the many, but I love Manon. I really do love her character and her story and it makes me feel so attached to her knowing all the wicked things she and her coven went through in order to become these lethal creatures, heartless and soulless. Let’s give a sister the appreciation she deserves!I am sorry to announce though that throughout the book the most boring of all characters had to be Chaol. I really am sorry, I actually skipped a couple of his chapters.Oops.Until the end of the book though, my heart got so warm with love for him and also for my pretty prince Dorian that I just couldn’t take it anymore. Don’t want to sound too much, but boy, Chaol and Dorian really turned out to be the real OTP of the whole bookand I am living for it.As you already know (and if you don’t let me enlight you), I have a tendency to infiltrate someRomanianismsin my reviews. I know I am the only one in this whole wide world to make connections between a book I read and my language and culture but IT IS TRUE AND IT REALLY GOES RIGHTin my heart.InHeir of Fire, there is a particular celebration going on on some point in Mistward and that one is called Beltane, which consists of bonfires being ignited at night for some brave people who are ready to jump across them for good luck and good lives. Here in Romania, we have this very same tradition (minus the music and the food, we only get sweets while attending). Our celebration is calledFocul lui Sumendru, a Romanian tradition who is two thousand years old and it pretty much is the same as Beltane, but as in book Beltane is held in spring, ourFocis held in autumn, in order to keep the autumn steady as long as it can, to belate the harsh winter. Pretty cool, yeah, but DO NOT TRY IT AT HOME!Okay, now that I’ve also opened the celebration discussion and also closed it I would very much like to mention that it is very imperious (if you allow me to say so) that youdo notread this book in public! It gets very emotional and if you are like me, then it is a very complicated job to contain yourself while reading it.Seriously, my face almost cracked while trying to repress a very unladylike word from getting out my throat.Also, for my Romanians - Have you ever experiencedFocul lui Sumendru?",5
1387,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"Reasons why I didn't like this book:- It was dull as dirt- It was waaaaaaaay too long- I was so tired of the angst, no matter how justified it was- Rowan is overrated. There, I said it.- I fell asleep listening to the audiobook over 15 times. 7 alone for the last 10%.- The chapters with the witches felt SO POINTLESS. (BTW, the king outlawed magic, but witches are okay? dafuq? Oh well, I don't care.)- I feel like each book follows the same plot: Celena trains. Celena fights with cute guy. Mysterious monster is killing people. Celena kills monster. Fin.UGH. I CAN'T.",1
1388,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"”She has no hope, Prince. She has no hope left in her heart. Help her. If not for her sake, then at least for what she represents – what she could offer all of us, you included.”“And what is that?” he dared ask.Emrys met his gaze unflinchingly as he whispered, “A better world.”First of all:YES, the rumour is true!This series really gets better and better with each and every single book! ;-)Just thought I’d let you know! *lol*To be honest, after“Crown of Midnight”all I hoped for was that“Heir of Fire”would be able to keep the pace. And tell you what? It actually exceeded my, admittedly, already high expectations! Yes, Sarah! You did an amazing job with this one! I was hooked right from the beginning and I didn’t want to stop to read this damn book!!!I loved this book, I loved it so freaking much! It was so, so, so, so, SOOO, good!!!And I was happy with it, I was SO happy with it!UNTIL…UNTILthe last 20 pages hit me!! ARGH!!! T_TI thought I’d be able to write about “Heir of Fire” without getting all too emotional but as it seems all my plans and good intentions just went out of the window. I can’t write about this book without getting emotional! I just can’t! It was too much!! That ending was too much!!! WHY?WHY THE FREAKIDY FREAKING HELL, SARAH!!!!????How could you do this to me??!!HOW?!I LOVE THIS BOOK!BUT I HATE THIS ENDING SO MUCH!I hate it,I love it,I hate that I love it,I love that I hate it!ADSFJKLMNÖ ADKFASLDFJASDKFASDK!*throws book against the wall**a second time**for good measure*Okay, I think I’m ready to continue now. *takes deep breath and collects herself*All right! Let’s do this!Just like with “Crown of Midnight” I won’t waste your time by writing about the plot. It’s way too complex to explain it without any spoilers and because of that, I guess it might be best if I just go for another round of “Keyword Boggle”!It was so much fun the last time around, wasn’t it? ;-PSo here I go: Celaena, Dorian, Chaol, Rowan, Aelin, Manon, Abraxos, Sorscha, The King, magic, faeries, witches, darkness, fire, ice, wind, a kitchen, a healer, an apartment, blood, murder, and let’s not forget about the black stones. XDI guess by now you could write your own book! *lol*We’re still speaking about Sarah’s book though, so I’ll head directly into the characters section and won’t keep you in suspense any longer.The characters:Do I still have to say it? Yes? Okay! Beware of my characters section because it’s known as the spoilery spoiler section of my reviews! Don’t read on, close your eyes, eat an ice, please think twice, I’m not nice, my reviews have spice. And spoilers, lots of spoilers, but you already know that or you wouldn’t have continued to read that bad rhyme! ;-PCelaena:”So you’d save another land, but not yours. Why can’t your friend save her own kingdom?”“Because she is dead!” She screamed the last word so loudly it burned in her throat. “Because she is dead, and I am left with my worthless life!”*sighs deeply* Oh, Celaena! How much pain does this poor girl have to endure? It hurt to read about her feelings after Nehemia’s death, it hurt to read how much she ached and wished she could have been someone else. That she could have saved her friend. That Nehemia would live instead of her. That Chaol would have trusted her. That he would have told her… Oh boy, Celaena’s heart was a black void of desperation and pain that only seemed to get worse before it even got a chance to get better. In the end it did get better though and I’m so happy about that! She finally found her inner strength and she accepted her heritage! Which is awesome, because I really can’t wait for her to kick some ass! *lol* Heaven knows the King’s behind is already a formidable target and please Sarah if there is any justice in your world you’ll let him burn for what he did!!! You’ll let him suffer for all the pain he caused!!! I can’t wait to see Celaena’s power unleashed! Guess the palace is going to be “hot stuff” soon! ;-P”He had chosen the king. Even though he’d claimed he loved her, he still loyally served that monster. Maybe she had been a fool for letting him in, for dreaming of a world where she could ignore the fact that he was captain to the man who had shattered her life again and again.””No, all she could see were the slaves she’d left behind, the ashy mountains and those mass graves they dug every day, the faces of her people, who had worked beside her – her people whom she had left behind. Whom she had let herself forget, had let suffer; who had prayed for salvation, holding out hope that someone, anyone would remember them.She had abandoned them – and she had been too late.””She would not let that light go out. She would fill the world with it, with her light – her gift. She would light up the darkness, so brightly that all who were lost or wounded or broken would find their way to it, a beacon for those who still dwelled in that abyss. It would not take a monster to destroy a monster – but light, light to drive out darkness.She was not afraid.”Chaol:”He was afraid of what they would do to his kingdom. Because this was still his kingdom. He was working for Dorian, not Aelin – not Aedion. And he didn’t know where all of this put him.”YESH! I know it was a long and hard way for Chaol but as it seems he’s finally on the right track! I loved that he began to question everything. He was so insecure and hurt that he had no other choice than to face his outlook on things and in the end this eventually forced him to see behind the kings carefully kept façade. Which is awesome, because I know deep down within him Chaol is a very good man!!! He was just completely oblivious to the fact that the served a monster! Still, I’m glad he decided for Dorian and I swear if Celaena and Chaol don’t do anything about this damn ending, I’m going to riot!!!! CHAOL you gotta help your Prince and rightful king!!!!”I will not turn my back on my kingdom or my prince,” Chaol snapped. “I will not fight in your army and slaughter my people. And I will not break my vow to my father.” His honor might very well be all he would have left after the end of this.Aedion was quiet long enough that Chaol got up to leave. But then the general said, “What would you have given – just to see her again?”Chaol couldn’t turn around as he said, “It doesn’t matter now.”Chaol kept his sword drawn. “I will not go to Anielle,” he growled. “And I will not serve you a moment longer. There is one true king in this room – there always has been. And he is not sitting on that throne.”Dorian:”Once Dorian might have already said something about it. But having magic, getting drawn into whatever mess Celaena was in, seeing that other world in the secret tunnels … all of that had changed everything. The best he could do these days was maintain a low profile – to keep his father or anyone else from looking too long in his direction.”WHY SARAH??!! WHYYYYY? *breaks down and sobs*Why do you have to use him as a human punching bag? Dorian is so decent and compassionate; he doesn’t deserve to be broken!!! First you hurt him by finding out about Chaol’s and Celaena’s secret, then you kill off his girlfriend and in the end you even let him be forced into the Kings slavery!!??LIKE SERIOUSLY!!?? WTFH!!?? WTF!!?? I CAN’T WITH THIS ENDING!!! I JUST CAN’T!!! HE SUFFERED ENOUGH!!!I don’t even want to know what is going to happen now that he’s wearing this freaking collar! He saved Chaol’s life! GODDAMNIT!!! GIVE MY BOY A BREAK!!! Sarah, I swear it here and now if Dorian isn’t saved by the end of book 4 I won’t continue to read this series. I just won’t! I know it’s the author’s right and decision to kill off characters or to make them suffer as they please, but I just can’t take it anymore. Dorian is my cutiepie and cinnamon roll and I think my heart hurts enough! I survived 3 books of ACOTAR watching how my precious Lucien went through hell and I just can’t take this anymore. Lucien never got his happily ever after and it still hurts!!! So no, sorry but no! If Dorian isn’t at least halfway alright after “Queen of Shadows” then I’m quitting this series! Period! I made up my mind! There was so much potential to give Dorian’s character a chance to evolve and to be awesome and interesting! So much raw magic that could have been used, but all that happened was that Sorscha died and Dorian sacrificed himself for Chaol. I’m pissed, I’m majorly pissed! And coming from me that means a lot! So yeah, this wrong is better set right or I’m quitting! I’m serious and I mean it! This said:#TeamDorian forever and for always!!! <333”He’d been a fool once, swearing he would tear the world apart for Celaena. A boy in love with a wildfire – or believing he was in love with one.””Because you’re not really scared of those things, are you? No – it’s what they represent. The change. But let me tell you,” Dorian breathed, his magic flickering and then subsiding in a flash of pain, “things have already changed. And changed because of you. I have magic – there is no undoing that, not getting rid of it. And as for Celaena …” He clamped down on the power that surged as he imagined – for the first time, he realized – what it was to be her. “As for Celaena,” he said again, “you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.””We’re all risking something.” There was so little of the friend he’d grown up with. The prince glanced at his pocket watch. “I need to go.” Dorian stalked to the stairs, and there was no fear in his face, no doubt, as he said, “You gave me the truth today, so I’ll share mine: even if it meant us being friends again, I don’t think I would want to go back to how it was before – who I was before. And this …” He jerked his chin towards the scattered crystals and the bowl of water. “I think this is a good change, too. Don’t fear it.”Aedion Ashryver:”Handsome was a light way of describing what Aedion was. Overwhelming was more like it. Towering and heavily muscled, Aedion was every inch the warrior rumor claimed him to be.”I like Aedion! I like him a lot!!! He’s such a tortured soul and he tried everything possible in order to protect his people! He was an intriguing new character and I can’t wait to see more of him. I really liked his interactions with Dorian because they were so much fun! *lol* Those two have a lot of potential to become close friends, but I guess the ending of this book kind of nullified that possibility. Still, I want Aedion’s noble and brave soul to be rescued as well and I don’t even want to know what the king is going to do with him. T_T I hope Aelin returns soon because her boys definitely need her right now! Poor Aedion, he waited for so long!!! And if I’m already at it! He saved Chaol’s ass too, so Chaol better get his groove on! He needs to make plans to save him as well! XD”Cousin – that had been his most beloved title. Cousin, kin, protector. Those were the secret names he harboured deep within, the names he whispered to himself when the northern wind was shrieking through the Staghorns.””Aelin would come back from Wendlyn, no matter what the captain believed. Aelin would come back, and when she did … With every breath, Aedion felt that lingering scent wrapping tighter around his heart and soul. When she came back, he was never letting her go.””All you monsters can burn in hell. Because my queen is coming – and she will spike you to the walls of your godsdamned castle. And I can’t wait to help her gut you like the pig you are.” He spat at the king’s feet, right on top of the fake ring that had stopped bouncing.Rowan:”She noticed then that his arms were bandaged, and more bandages across his broad chest peeked up from beneath his shirt. She’d burned him again. And yet he had held on to her – had run all the way here and not let go once.”The fierce, broody and intense warrior! I like him even though I have to admit that his abilities as a teacher kind of lack experience. *lol* Still, he’s a decent fae and despite the way he acted at the beginning of the book his heart actually seems to be in the right place. I loved that he took care of Celaena once he realised why she’s so broken and I suppose their fight at the beginning was kind of necessary. They both needed to let off some steam. XD I genuinely hope we’ll see more of him in the next book, because I feel like there is so much more to tell! ;-)”How – how did you come back from that kind of loss?”“I didn’t. For a long while I couldn’t. I think I’m still … not back. I might never be.”She nodded, lips pressed tight, and glanced toward the window.“But maybe,” he said, quietly enough that she looked at him again. He didn’t smile, but his eyes were inquisitive. “Maybe we could find the way back together.”Manon:Silent as death, Manon slid up behind him. The fool didn’t even know she was there until she brought her mouth close to his ear and whispered, “Wrong kind of witch.”I’M IN LOVE WITH MANON BLACKBEAK!!!This woman is so savage and fierce! I love it! *lol* As it seems for once my prayers were answered! I got more of the iron teeth witches and I loved every single chapter! XD Manon is so damn amazing! I just couldn’t get enough of her and followed her storyline closely. Truth be told, I just want to lean back and watch how her and Abraxos change the world. Haha! I disliked Manon’s grandmother a lot though and even though she became Wing Leader I’m pretty sure there will be some major estrangement in the future. Still, I loved Manon’s connection with Asterin and her Thirteen and I really hope they’ll always be at her side. Maybe Petrah will join them one day? Idk! I truly hope she’ll be fine some day because I really liked her too. >_<”You’re mine,” Manon said to him.The wyvern blinked at her, Titus’s blood still dripping from his cracked and broken teeth, and Manon had the feeling that he had come to the same decision. Perhaps he had known long before tonight, and his fight with Titus hadn’t been so much about survival as it had been a challenge to claim her.As his rider. As his mistress. As his.””And Manon, because no one was watching, because she did not care, flung out her arms as well and savoured the freefall, the wind now a song in her ears, in her shriveled heart.””You touch him again,” Manon said, “and I’ll drink the marrow from your bones.”The friendships & ships:Chaol & Dorian:He met Dorian’s gaze. There was nothing kind in it. But Dorian said, “I’m trying, Chaol.”Trying, because Chaol’s not consulting him on the plan to get Celaena out of Adarlan had been a breach of trust, and one that shamed him, though Dorian could never know that, either. “I know.”Oh, those two broke my heart! I really wanted them to solve their problems and then this damn ending came along!!! ARGH! They need a chance to fix all this! Sarah give them a chance, please!? They deserve it! AndOMG Chaol told Dorian that he loves him!!!Way too late but he did it!!! <33 I just want my two boys to be happy and friends again. *sobs* They both suffered enough in those last two books, they really deserve some peace!!! And to take away their chance to make amends!! So mean, Sarah! So, so mean!!! >_<”You think I’d run to my father?” The words were barely more than a strangled whisper as the temperature plummeted.Chaol stepped forward, putting himself between Aedion and Dorian, his palms exposed. Placating. “I can’t afford to guess – to hope. Even with you.””You cannot pick and choose what parts of her to love.” He pitied Chaol, he realized. His heart hurt for his friend, for all that Chaol had surely been realizing these past few months. “Just as you cannot pick which parts of me you accept.””He looked at his friend, perhaps for the last time, and said what he had always known, from the moment they’d met, when he’d understood that the prince was his brother in soul. “I love you.” Dorian merely nodded, eyes still blazing, and lifted his hands again towards his father. Brother. Friend. King.Sorscha & Dorian:”She usually talked like this when she was nervous. Which, Dorian had noticed with some satisfaction, was when he came near. And not in a bad way – if he’d sensed that she was truly uncomfortable, he’d have kept his distance. This was more … flustered. He liked flustered.”I suppose their relationship was doomed right from the beginning but I still would have liked it to work out. They were so sweet together, but I can’t shake the feeling that I missed some major parts of their plot. I really wish Sarah would have given us more of them because to me their entire storyline felt kinda rushed. Still, I was glad Sorscha helped Dorian to hide his magic and her being a spy was such an unexpected plot twist. >_< It really killed me when the King ordered her death and I can’t even describe how much Dorian’s pain hurt me! T_T I’m still not over this… probably I’ll never be!”Yes,” he breathed, and kissed her. It was fast – but her face was flushed, and her eyes wide as he pulled back. His own eyes were wide, gods be damned, and he was still rubbing his thumb against her soft cheek. Still contemplating going back for more, because that hadn’t been nearly enough.”Celaena & Rowan:”Why don’t you just bite me again?”“Why don’t I give you the lashing you deserve?”He looked so dead set on it that she blinked. “If you ever take a whip to me, I will skin you alive.”Oh, ho ho! Those two!! So much passion, so much pain! They were quite a sight to behold! *lol* I loved how their initial animosity turned into a solid friendship and I was so glad Celaena finally told someone about her past! This was so damn necessary and I’m glad Rowan was there to listen to her troubles and fears! <3 I’m sure they’ll become lovers in the future, but as it seems Sarah just wants to torture us a little bit more. ;-P After all she’s good at that, torture seems to be her middle name! XD Bet the J. is just a fib! Haha!”It was a selfish wish, and a fool’s hope.” She read the rest of it in his eyes. But it came true. “Dangerous, for a prince of ice and wind to pray to the Fire-Bringer,” she managed to say.Rowan shrugged, a secret smile on his face as he wiped away the tear that escaped down her cheek. “For some reason, Mala likes me, and agreed that you and I make a formidable pair.”Okay, I think I ranted enough now. *lol* So yeah, I hope I’ll get my hands on“Queen of Shadows”soon and that myprecious Gemwill continue this journey with me! I even wrote nice things about Chaol!! That’s got to count! ;-P",5
1389,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"Ohmygosh. The Maas-ter has done it againShe was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.This one wasso freaking good.Honestly, when was the last time that the third book in a series was just as good as the first?Celaena -deadly, battered and broken- is sent to a neighboring kingdom. She must find a way to destroy the wyrdkeys to save the kingdom (and possibly the world) from the rule of a corrupt kingdom.And then I am going to rattle the stars.Manon -ruthless, disciplined and wicked- is of the blackbeak witches. She's sent to join the corrupt king's army as a wyvern rider and manages to raise hell while doing it.There were few sounds she enjoyed more than the groans of dying men, but the wind was one of them.Chaol and Dorian -prim, proper and honestly bit boring- must deal with their ever-collapsing kingdom. From mass murder to magic mayhem, this year is going to the ultimate make-or-break for them.He would see that world reborn, even if it took his last breath. Even if he had no name now, no position or title save Oath-Breaker, Traitor, Liar.Sarah J Maas manages to weave thesethree unique storylinestogether in such an unforgettable way. I could hardly read this one fast enough. I cannot wait to get my hands on the next!P.s. Young Celaena is possibly my fave character ever.Her dearest friends are characters in books.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads",5
1390,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"Brilliant. Sarah J Maas is becoming my favourite author. Her writing style is engaging, engrossing, intelligent, and easy to follow. Her imagination and storytelling are amazing. This story is a lot slower than the Crown of Midnight; it concentrates more on the character development.At the end of the last book, we learned not only who Celaena Sardothien really is but also what she really is. Her relationship with Chaol is in tatters. Having ""suggested"" to the king to send her on a mission for her own protection and cutting Prince Dorian out of the loop, Chaol is in no man’s land. Distancing himself from Dorian, for Dorian own protection, he starts to do his job and notices some irregularities with a certain high-ranking general. This forces Chaol to make some decisions of his own, how long can a good honourable man serve a tyrant like the King of Aldarlan and his many atrocities.Dorian is more alone than he has ever been, but he does manage to find solace. Finding a company is not really difficult for a handsome prince, but who can he trust. This is triply difficult as he has to not only keep his own actives, which his father will not approve of secret, his friends secrets, and most of all, his magic.We also introduced the Iron Teeth Witch Clans and especially Manon Blackbeak. Meanwhile, Celaena detours from her mission and pursues her own agenda. Meeting forgotten and powerful relatives. Before she is allowed to get the answers she wants, she must claim her heritage (her powers). She must learn to control them and master them all the while, putting he shattered life and her past. I really like the way she has to train and relearn everything. Just because you are in a stronger body does not mean you can control it, especially in a fight situation.Great story, very character driven, and impossible to put down. I kept thinking I would just read one more chapter, flicked a few pages, and thought ok I will stop at the next section break, or that's a short chapter might as well as finish it. Suddenly, half a quarter of the book was gone. Despite being 550+ pages, the book just flies by. It sets up the next book excellently, including a confrontation I have been begging for since the first e-novel.",5
1391,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"Initial Reaction: Holy crap. I can't breathe. Oh my god. That was epic. WHERE IS BOOK #4??Read the full review atA Perfection Called Books**This review contains spoilers from previous Throne of Glass booksAs I'm sure you all know by now, I am obsessed with the Throne of Glass series by Sarah J Maas. I was ecstatic when Bloomsbury sent me an ARC! Picking up not long after the heart-wrenching end of Crown of Midnight, Sarah J Maas dazzles and entrances readers once more with a phenomenal third book filled with magic, character growth, sacrifice, rebellion and more.“I wish you to become who you ­were born to be. To become queen.”Heir of Fire has most definitely made my list of best books of 2014. This book is quite different from the others in the series. I liked it a bit less than the other two, but it was so different it's hard to compare them. The other books center around romance and action while this book deals with the deeper stuff: betrayal, confidence, mourning, rebellion, heritage, loyalty...This book is huge. It was a bit cumbersome to hold, but the content was great! The beginning was a bit slow but eventually picked up. Everything written was absolutely necessary to carry the story though, so I didn't mind. The attention to detail was amazing. Everything was there for a reason, there were connections to the other books all over the place! It brought back all the feels from The Assassin's Blade & Crown of Midnight. Sarah J Maas is so meticulous about her writing and is truly in a league of her own. The tone of the book was much darker too. Maas has set this series on a much darker (and awesome) road than most YA series (even fantasy novels) tend to go, and I applaud her for it.The high fantasy aspect of this book was amped up. There was magic and wyverns and fae! I loved it all. This series reminds me of a YA version of Game of Thrones a bit... Less sex and deaths though. The world-building was fantastic. Everything was so clearly described. I could see it all playing out in my mind.The character development in this series is fantastic. Each of our characters has his/her own obstacles that must be overcome; they all have their own journeys.“Because I am lost,"" she whispered onto the earth. ""And I do not know the way.”We see a totally different side of Celaena in Heir of Fire. We're used to the cocky, confident, invincible assassin. In this book we see the vulnerable, defeated, self-loathing side of her. In the end though she comes out more fierce and determined than before, a magic-wielding queen ready to take back what's rightfully hers.“As for Celaena,"" he said again, ""you do not have the right to wish she were not what she is. The only thing you have a right to do is decide whether you are her enemy or her friend.”Chaol struggles to decide where his loyalties lie and how he feels about Celaena and the discoveries he made in Crown of Midnight. I'll admit, Chaol annoyed me so much in this book. He redeems himself in the end though. Dorian struggles to conceal his magic and stand up to his father. Both characters come so far in this book. They sacrifice so much and in the end they make the tough decisions where this is no turning back.There are quite a few new characters introduced in this book: Rowan, the fae prince and warrior who teaches Celaena how to control her magic. Aedion, the fierce general and Celaena's cousin. Manon, ferocious heir to the Blackbeak witch coven. All of the characters in this book are so complex and well developed. The secondary characters are just as descriptive as well. I ALMOST ship Rowan and Celaena, but I think they're more of a team. He's so fiercely devoted and smart and honest and awesome!! Aedion is so loyal and amazing. Manon is okay, she's a bit too blood-thirsty...With new characters come more points of view. Overall I liked the various perspectives because the plot needed all sides of the story to make sense. Sometimes though I felt that some scenes were quite unnecessary and long and dragging.We learn so many things about Erilea and what happened to Celaena ten years ago. It's all quite mind-blowing and a bit overwhelming. We also learn more about the King's nefarious actions. We see connections all over the place from the various books! Maas has been spreading the crumbs throughout the series until BAM you read Heir of Fire, and it all comes together!! The wyrdstones. The tower. The rings. The disappearances. The crumbled note. The rebels. Baba Yellowlegs. Everything happens for a reason and contributes to the story in some way.“The people you love are just weapons that will be used against you.”Romance was not a big part of this novel. There are some heartache moments for our dearest Chaolaena and a bit of romance, but there are much more important things brewing in Erilea and Wendlyn. This series is past the silly romance, it's moved on to the important stuff like defeating a diabolical king, bringing back magic, freeing the enslaved, and so on.As I said before, this book starts off a bit slow. Stick with it though, if you liked the other books you'll love this one as well. The ending is horrific yet amazing at the same time. The rebellion is forming, and we readers are kept wanting more.“He would see that world reborn, even if it took his last breath. Even if he had no name now, no position or title save Oath-Breaker, Traitor, Liar.”Heir of Fire is yet another amazing installment of the Throne of Glass series. WHERE IS BOOK #4????“She was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.”Pre-Reading Hyped Review:Oh Captain... I'm waiting ;)6/21I am getting a physical ARC copy of HEIR OF FIRE.

1392,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"i love rereads! i love taking the risk and seeing if a story is as good as you remember it being or if your feelings have changed. in this case, i enjoyed this book (and series, in general) so much more my second go-around.feelings that stayed the same:- gratitute for the information given about celaena/aelins past- love for chaols character development- appreciation for the insanely effective writing and world buildingfeelings that changed:- i was no longer bothered by the characters being split up and sent different directions- i immediately bonded with rowan, whereas it originally took me until book #4 to do so- manons chapters bored me, for some reason, this time around______________________________i am running out of ways to praise the masterpiece that is SJM storytelling. she tends to be simple in her writing, but a rawness and vibrancy comes through in that simplicity, which makes the story easy to devour. and this third installment is no exception; if anything, its even better!i loved learning more about celaenas past (which i have been desperate for since book one) and i enjoyed seeing chaol develop as a character. if i could change anything about this book, however, it would have been to not separate the main characters. i hate it when the plot of a book allows for a separation because i spend the entire book waiting forever for everyone to be reunited again. so i am very much looking forward to that reunion in the next book!↠4.5 stars",5
1393,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"""Hello, Aelin Galathynius.""Finally made it to the light at the end of the tunnel! It was touch and go for two books, but this... this didn't even feel like belonging to the same series anymore. Maas has fixed almost everything I didn't care for in the first two books, starting with Celaena's character, which is literally gone, to be replaced by new and improved, and more believable Aelin Galathynius. The assassin who never assassinates, or even behaves as an assassin is no more.While we still get to enjoy the three key POVs, there are some great new characters being improved in this third book, each sharing their own perspectives. The way Maas tying two or three of them at a time (may be except for Manon) for each chapter made for a little unusual, but quite an interesting reading experience. It broke the monotony of the flow of story very well in my opinion. And Manon... A fascinating new character with her own immersive thread. I was a little confused at start, but quickly came to love that particular plotline: It was new, had a lot of mystery, and continuously eventful. And then Aedion and Rowan, who were equally interesting additions to the story, and there was never a dull moment with this trio.""It was madness and joy and terror and despair and eternity.""Now that I have finished three books, I did start to see certain similarities as well. In each book, Maas took her time in the first half, maintaining a slower pace, heavily focused on character relationships while sprinkling a little bit of magic and mystery here and there. But the second halves were always much faster, eventful, and a lot more thrilling. I was too annoyed with Celaena's character before to clearly notice this before, but I'm hoping it would be consistent throughout the series.Though it didn't make much sense, I had still found the plot of this of series intriguing from the very first book. Heir of Fire finally explains many of those mysteries we had come across before, and appeared to be setting the direction of the series. More than once, I felt this could've been a better starting point to this series. Compared to where we started, the plot was also a lot more complex with in-depth world building. With 4 more books remaining, I know it's too early to form an overall opinion, but, it feels like things could only get better after this. This is one of the best comebacks I've came across lately.""Loyalty is earned, not given.""",4
1394,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),BEAUTIFUL. JUST SO DANG BEAUTIFUL.I loved the new characters (except Sorscha) and it was just a wonderful book. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF MANON. AND ROWAN. AND CELAENA (duh).Now where's my copy of Queen of Shadows?,5
1395,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),perfection.,5
1396,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"I dont think you fuckers realize how fecking amazing this series is“So she steeled herself. “I have never told anyone this story. No one in the world knows it. But it’s mine,” she said, blinking past the burning in her eyes, “and it’s time for me to tell it.”This series is either a love or hate for most, but either way you have to admit howbrilliantthe writing is, howdynamicthe characters are and howshockingthose freaking PLOT twists are !!Celaenaour heroine-- broken and exhausted by life... and goddamn I relate to that“You cannot pick and choose what parts of her to love. You do not have the right to wish she were not what she is.”But she learns to embrace her powers and control them. Sometimes it takes a monster to fight a monster.“Perhaps they would never get out of it, perhaps they would never be whole again, but … “Together,” she said, and took his outstretched hand.And somewhere far and deep inside her, an ember began to glow.”It's honestly been SUCH an amazing journey on how far our character has come. I mean seriously, her story is justfucking amazingand complex and intricate and everything has meaning and comes together and this world is just awesome“She told him of the years in Rifthold, of stealing Asterion horses and racing across the desert, of dancing until dawn with courtesans and thieves and all the beautiful, wicked creatures in the world. “Aelin is so much more developed now three books later andwith each calculated move, you love her more. Her story has become so much more than the simple assassin trying to buy her freedom we first met. Now a powerful queen willing to fight for everyone’s freedom....once she figures out how to masters her powers that is“She was not its slave. She was no one’s slave anymore. And if Rowan threw one more damned dagger at her face— He did.”Thatfirebreathing bitch(✿ ♥‿♥) And of course I fell in love withRowan“Wipe that smarmy, lying smile off your face.” His voice was as dead as his eyes, but it had a razor-sharp bite behind it.She kept her smarmy, lying smile. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”Even Rowan found out that she is somuch more than the deadly insane assassin personashe showed to the world for so many years. And really how could he fucking judge, the goddamn fey assassin for fucking queen Maeve*eye rolling*“At least if you’re going to hell,” he said, the vibrations in his chest rumbling against her, “then we’ll be there together.”“I feel bad for the dark god already.”And the training scenes were hilarious !! Sometimes this can be a dull part of a book OR worse!! When people are suddenly masters of epic powers*grrrrr*Instead, she epically messed up... quite a lot... Aelin had to learn to control her abilities and fucked up quite a bit, to be honest“But each morning brought something new, something harder and different and miserable. Gods, he was brilliant. Cunning and wicked and brilliant.Even when he beat the hell out of her. Every. Damn. Day.”CAN'T YOU JUST PICTURE IT !She began the story asCelaena: assassin of Adarlanbetrayed by loved Chaol, manipulated by Nehemia, and scared of her own power and destiny. She ended asAelin Ashryver Galathynius“She was as much a queen as Maeve. She was the sovereign of a strong people and a mighty kingdom. She was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one.”And it all comes together with reiterating my FAVORITE quote from the first book“I will call in every favor, every debt owed to Celaena Sardothien, to my parents, to my bloodline. And then…” She looked toward the sea, toward home.“And then I am going to rattle the stars.”",5
1397,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"Uuuuh, girl.Empezamos a ver elevidente cambio en el universo deTrono de Cristal, una saga que comienza de forma un poco 'inocente' para lo que nos espera en sus continuaciones.Se nota hacia dónde vamos, y todo lo que ha llevado a este punto simplemente encaja, cuadra y te hace querer descubrir todo lo que Sarah tiene entre manos para con esta saga.Mucha gente odia a Celaena(¡cosa que no entiendo!),y aunque en ocasiones toma ciertas decisiones más que cuestionables, siempre sale airosa de las situaciones, porque tiene una mente estratégica y conoce perfectamente las posibles variables de sus planes. Pero sobre todo, lo que más me gusta de ella, es su psique.Es fuerte, conoce sus límites y miedos, y es capaz de controlar tantísimas emociones y guardarlas para fortalecerle que simplemente chapó.La construcción del personaje no deja de mejorar, viendo a una protagonista mucho más madura y adulta que en la primera parte de esta saga.Heredera de fuegoes diferente a los otros dos libros en muchos aspectos. No solo es mayor en cuanto a longitud de páginas, sino quepor primera vez tenemos la introducción de nuevos personajes que tienen pinta de que han venido para quedarse.Además, no todos ellos tienen una presencia dentro del ecosistema que conocíamos en Adarlan con Celaena, Chaol o Dorian, sino que los mundos fantásticos deMaas exploran otras fronteras y nuevas posibilidades, algo que agradezco, porque se denota todo el cariño y esfuerzo deworldbuildingque tiene esta saga.Para hablar de nuevos personajes... Podría tirarme horas, la verdad.Me ha encantado Rowan.DE VERDAD. Me parece una especie de Celaena, un poquito más oscuro, déspota y con menos sentimientos, pero igual de fuerte y disciplinado con un pasado traumático. El tándem que se genera entre Rowan y ella es de lo mejor del libro y no podía despegarme de las páginas en sus escenas. Luego tenemos aManon,y descubriremos por fin más sobre la magia ancestral de las brujas en este universo que nos fue introducido vagamente enCorona de medianoche. Me ha encantado ver lo diferente que ese micro-cosmos sanguinario y milenario, con la introducción de nuevas criaturas fantásticas y conflictos que estoy seguro darán mucho que hablar en las continuaciones.También tenemos a Aedion, que simplemente...cheff kiss.Quizá no tanto por él en sí, sino todo lo que le rodea, lo que genera en cuanto a temática y lo que supone para el futuro de la historia.He de admitir que me ha costado un poco terminar este libro.Lo abandoné un poquito más hacia el final, superado el ecuador, y como siempre me pasa... me arrepentí. Por mucho que me fascinara Manon como personaje, sus escenas a veces eran algo repetitivas.Lo que sucede en palacio con Dorian y Chaol era entretenido pero sentía que a veces renqueaba, avanzando demasiado lento.Pero bueno, que estoy hablando de un libro de Sarah J Maas. ¡Que en verdad no tiene relleno! Porque una vez avanzas esos obstáculos donde se definen personajes o se le dabackgrounda ciertas tramas o problemas, todo cobra sentido para desembocar en un final apoteósico.[image error]La evolución de la magia en este libro ha sido sin duda de lo mejor.Poder ver a Aelin disfrutar de todo su potencial, conocer la verdadera naturaleza de sus poderes,el inicio de lo que parece ser un ejército de zombies, los guivernos, conocer por fin el poder del rey de Adarlan... No sé, brillante que comencemos hablando de asesinatos para terminar en una guerra de poder mágico entre territorios.Heredera de fuegopuede no haberme volado la mente como los anteriores, pero consigue cementar a la saga como una de calidad superior y de personajes simplemente increíbles, y por eso se lleva mis dieces.Muero de ganas por tener en mis manos el siguiente, que saldrá a la venta en español en los próximos meses. ¡Ya os contaré!",5
1398,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"I had forgotten how agonizing this book is.It's a beautiful tale of grief, trauma, and in the end—triumph.Celaena Sardothien.Arrogant, charming, fiercely loyal. She's been broken. Over and over and over again. And yet she still stands strong, even in the face of suffering, agony, and emotional torture. She came to Wendlyn an empty person, devoid of all joy and peace. She left Wendlyn changed. She faced her past. She learned to accept every shattered part of her.Rowan Whitethorn.Resilient, stubborn, sardonic. He's all sharp edges and prickly thorns, but once Celaena gets past his rough exterior, she realizes he is hurting. Just like she is. They are kindred spirits in a lonely world.Chaol Westfall.Bitter, persistent, brave. He was left in pieces when Celaena left for Wendlyn. His friendship with Dorian is in tatters, his mental health is at a low. But he carries on. He's the only ordinary human in a world filled with magic, and he feels his weaknesses with every step.However, he is not right for Celaena, and we all know it. He sold her out and he refused to accept every part of her. He was an essential part of her journey, but she is a different person now.""She was not becoming anything different from what she always was and always had the capacity to be. You just finally saw everything. And once you saw that other part of her..."" Dorian said quietly. ""You cannot pick and choose which parts of her to love.""Dorian Havilliard.Devoted, intelligent, determined. He's insightful and sensitive, always tuned to the feelings and needs of others. He's accepting and kind, forgiving and generous. He accepts Celaena and still treats her like a friend, understanding that she must move on.Sorscha.Kind, gentle, courageous. I hated her the first time I read this book. But this time around, I was actually quite fond of her. She's a quiet, brave person. Her mild infatuation with Dorian still annoys me, but I can see now that she was absolutely essential to his recovery process. She helped Dorian when he was lonely and hurting. She made a discovery about magic that was very underwhelming, but at least she actually tried to help him.Manon Blackbeak.Cruel, cold, adamant. Violent and steadfast and so gloriouslybrutal.She's devoted to the Thirteen before everyone else. She's terrifying and beautifully deadly, but she cares deeply once you get past her mask. She's been manipulated and molded into the killing machine that she is now, but there is a great possibility for kindness within her, and that part of her shows whenever she's around Abraxos.Aedion Ashryver.Clever, loyal, haunted. He's hot-headed and bloodthirsty, but his mind never leaves Aelin. He's been living a lie ever since the massacre at Terrasen, and he's determined to destroy Adarlan from the inside out.These characters are beautiful.They're flawed, but so wonderfully vibrant.They jump off the page, almost. They have personal struggles and fears, but they're brave and loyal and dedicated to their cause. I love them.4.5 stars__IT WAS WONDERFULIT WAS STUNNINGIT WAS PERFECTIONreview to come__Throne of Glass reread marathon, part 3.Buddy reread with many wonderful humans.This had better be as good as it was the first time",5
1399,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"I loved this book. I enjoyed how the chapters jumped to completely different scenes, like Aelin in wendyll, to Manon, to Things happening in adarlan. The stuff going on back in Adarlan was a tad boring and not my favorite chapters. They were slow and felt a tad unimportant in some cases. BUT THE ONES WITH AELIN AND ROWAN. Loved every second of them. AND what was going on with the witches, loved. It was cool to see aelins power come to life and really see her break through mental barriers to become so damn strong.ROWAN BLOOD OATHING TO SERVE AELIN UM OK",4
1400,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING BETTER THEN THE PROGRESSION OF THIS SERIES.. THIS MIGHT BE MY FAVOURITE ONE SO FAR!,5
1401,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"It gets better and better with every reread. I hope I never get sick of this.“She’d been running for so long that she didn’t know what it was to stand and fight.”Reread number 5.Random tidbit:I was getting Dragonball Z flashes in my head every time Aelin would transform and use her fore magic. Super Saiyan! 🔥Heir of Fire is as of now my favourite book in the series. This book is godsend, I’m telling you. The rich development of the plot and the characters, the scope of the world, the side characters, the multiple POV's... Maas truly outdid herself with this book.Celaena was just phenomenal in this instalment. Her growth was astounding and I loved how this started off with her almost breaking down with grief and depression and intense self-hatred and shame. Sarah J Maas has a knack for really diving into broken characters, and as the story progressed and we found out more about Celaena’s past, I felt the weight of her sadness responsibility with her. It was heartbreaking to read.One of the main things I’ve noticed whilst rereading the series this time round is how parallel and connected each plot and each character is to one another. There’s something about that that I just love, because it not just about Celaena trying to reclaim who she is, but about how each characters struggle and success adds to the bigger picture of it all, of this world they are wanting to rebuild and the peace it is trying to regain.Every character and their journey is adding something to the story, the bigger overall picture. And everything about this world and story just sits so well with me.",5
1402,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"4.5 bloody, beautiful starsThe adrenaline, the heartbreak, and the sweeping epicness of this story just slay me. What the hell am I supposed to do now? *weeps piteously*Also, I imagine Manon smiling calmly as she rips out your heart. :D",5
1403,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"lol @ past me... it definitely took me 3 months to read this book this time_________oct 2018It took me 4 months to read Crown of Midnight, and 4 days to read this one.So for me, this book was a MAJOR improvement. And I think... I might have liked it?Here's what worked for me:- major character development for Celaena, we finally get glimpses of actual emotion & not bullshit facade... I didn't want to punch her THAT much- Dorian is getting a personality!!!- Aedion, man of my dreams- MANON YOU ARE THE BITCH WITCH OF MY HEART- the plot was PLOT, like it actually moved and had depth and shit???- and of course... ROWANRowan, you sweet tortured baby, you deserve your own paragraph. IlovedRowan and I especially loved how he treated Celaena. Frankly, she kind of deserved to be treated like shit for a little bit. I liked that he was standoffish and that he has some backstory of his own. Inevitably, I compared him to Rhysand in my mind and that initially made Rowan fall kind of flat... but once I pushed that away I REALLY appreciated this sweet boi for what he is. Which is: perfect for Celaena.And I think that's really where Maas succeeds. She creates beautifully flawed (and yes sometimes annoying) characters that interact SO WELL with each other. I live for the ships in her books because flaws are complemented, strong suits are contrasted, and in general I wait with bated breath for the characters to get it on. So clearly she's doing something right.This was great & I'm VERY excited for the rest of the series.Also I didn't forget Chaol, I just hate him.",4
1404,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),How did I ever give this book only 3 stars initially?!,5
1405,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"3 - 3.5 StarsMaybe I will review this later, maybe I won’t...Regardless. The most important thing you need to know about my totally non important thoughts on this book is this:Helloooooooo Rowan.Hubba hubba.Other than that, some parts moved like a ship through mud; but in the end, I really loved seeing our protagonist come into her own here. I live for special powers, yo.But really...Hubba hubba, ROWAN.",3
1406,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestIn case you missed it, I recently read this fantasy romance from the 80s calledSUMMER OF THE UNICORN. It was from Kay Hooper's backlist (she only writes romantic suspense now), and I probably never would have discovered it if it hadn't recently been rereleased for Kindle and Netgalley hadn't subsequently approved me for the ARC. The book was so trashy and so bad, like, picture the worst science fiction book you've ever read from the 70s (probably written by Robert Heinlein, probablyTIME ENOUGH FOR LOVE), only with a whole cartload of wtf, unicorns, and sexy bathing scenes thrown in for lols, and that's SUMMER OF THE UNICORN. It was, objectively, not a good book, and yet despite my better sense, I enjoyed it, being the trash queen I am, because if a book is so bad it entertains me, I give that spit a good rating, even if I take the mickey out of it in my review.I've been working my way through Sarah J. Maas'sThrone of Glassseries over the last few months, and my thoughts on the series kind of mirror my thoughts about SUMMER OF THE UNICORN. I don't understand thepurposeof the book, because presumably it was written in a good faith attempt to be a serious fantasy novel, but on the other hand, it also has a whole cartload of wtf, unicorns, and sexy bathing scenes (except with theToGseries, replace ""unicorns"" with ""dragons"" and ""sexy bathing"" with ""sexy biting""). This is, objectively, not a good book, and yet I had such a good time making fun of it that I find myself becoming slightly fond of the series. It's like hating a dog that drools and pees everywhere but desperately wants to be your friend. That dog is annoying. That dog's mess is all over the place. But that dog also really, really wants you to like it. It's hard to hate that dog.***WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AND SNARK AHEAD***I thinkThrone of Glass'sbiggest problem is that it isgloriouslyuneven in terms of quality. There are parts of the book that are good, and then there are parts of the book that have me skimming like nobody's business. Durian's relationship with Fanta? Don't care. Raisin beating up Celery, over and over and over, until I wonder if I should be playing Tom Lehrer'sMasochism Tangoin the background? Don't care. Kale feels so bad about betraying Celery's feels? Don't care. Celery whining over and over about how she contributed to Queen Bae's death? Don't care. (Also, eff you, Celery. Your ""I want to read books and sit on my butt eating cake in between having sex with Kale"" was what led to that whole situation in the first place. It's just yet another episode of PoCs Dying to Make White People Give a F*ck, and that spit's so old that at this point, it's all reruns. Give it a rest.)On the other hand, this book also had some redeeming factors that were not present in the first book. I actually like Onion Ass-river. Mutton Blackberry isn't too bad either. I'm 99.9% sure that somewhere in that girl's room is a shrine to Daenerys Targaryen filled with hair and toenail clippings and she probably stands in front of it while practicing shouting ""WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS?"" But honestly, I really liked her relationship with Drogon - oops, I mean, Abraxos. He was cool. I kind of pictured him as looking like Toothless, fromHow to Train Your Dragon- a movie, incidentally, that Mutton really should watch, because this is something that she really sucks at.I think the worst thing about this series is the heroine, Celery, AKA Addledstar Galactica. My feelings towards her have been evolving across the series steadily. InTHRONE OF GLASS, I wanted to slap her. InCROWN OF MIDNIGHT, I wanted to slap her and maybe push her off a cliff. In HEIR OF FIRE, I wanted to push her off a cliff into a lake filled with a celery-eating Kraken. She is sooo annoying, and honestly, there is only so much you can read about how perfect a character is before you start to picture some RP-er being all, THIS IS MY ORIGINAL CHARACTER, YOU GUYS. SHE HAS RAINBOW HAIR AND SIX DIFFERENT KINDS OF MAGIC POWERS. If you thought that Miss Assassin was **SUPER SPESHUL** in the last two books, just wait until you get to this book, where you find out that she isn't just a queen, she also has a magical fairy form, and two different kinds of magic powers, which leave just about everyone who witnesses them in ~awe~.Also, Maas isn't content with the Kale/Celery/Durian love triangle in the last two books, plus the maybe Finnick O'Dair knock-off. No, in this book she has two more dudes fighting after her magical ladyparts - enter Rowan, who I'm pretty sure is knockoff Rhysand from the ACOTAR series (he even has magical fairy tattoos), and Onion Ass-river, who was Celery's childhood BFF. The Raisin/Celery ship is totally forced down the readers' throats in this book, and I'm just like, OKAY, what was the point of Kale and Durian at all in the first 2 then, if you're just going to make up new love interests when you get bored of them? Is Celery going to dump Raisin in the very last book of the series for some even more depraved, hotter dude with even better magical powers? Is she going to - *gasp* - date God Himself, because only He in all his glorious gloriousness is worthy of the holy sunlight that beams from the sanctity of her nether regions? I do wonder, because this spit is ridic.Also, also, what's with that line about not being able to hurt your soulmate? Celery reasons that this is why Kale and she are not to be - because she scratched his face up in the last book. BUT WAIT- didn't Raisin do the exact thing to you - MANY MANY TIMES? He bloodied your face and bruised your eye, and made you fight creatures so evil that you LITERALLY peed your pants in front of him. And then at the end of this book, suddenly you're soulmates? I'm SORRY, but by your logic, this relationship you have should be the opposite of soulmates, because HE HURT YOU BAD. #NotCoolThen we have Onion.I actually liked Onion's character, but the problem I have with him is endemic in the overarching themes of the book itself. I joked at first about the sexual tension between him and Kale, but by the end of the book, I was like, no, wait, there is actual tension here. It's like how Kale felt with Celery before, you know, she beat him up and ran off to be with someone who beats her up (ugh). Onion and Kale had actual great chemistry - the same way Celery had great chemistry with Queen Bae. I'd seen others complain about thequeerbaitingin this series, but HONESTLY, it feels legit. You have all these characters who seem like they'd be LGBT+ and have these potentially awesome ships with same-sex characters, ONLY to have SJM be like, ""Naaahh,"" and push them into cis-het relationships with characters who they previously had ZERO chemistry with in the previous books.Take Durian's relationship with Sorscha. WHERE THE HECK DID THAT COME FROM? Out of nowhere, that's where! Last I heard, he was mooning over Celery, but now he's just consorting with the servants - and then he decides, ALSO OUT OF NOWHERE, that he loves the servant to the point that he'd offer ~anything~?? Um, wait? Also, he legit says ""I love you"" to Kale and there's that sexual tension, which makes me feel like Kale might possibly be bi, but I BET YOU THAT THIS IS NEVER ADDRESSED, and that Kale ends up in a cis-het relationship with some rando who SJM just arbitrarily decides he's **meant** to be with in one of the later books.You also can't convince me that Queen Bae and Celery weren't OTP OTP, because in my mind, they totally were. The way Celery feels about Nehemia in this book is less like a dead friend and more like a lover who must be avenged. Not only was her death totally pointless, but I also felt like her relationship with Celery wasn't fully explored. The bond they had totally trumped anything Celery had with Kale, Durian, or her precious, precious Raisin; it was healthy, pure, and built on love.On non-relationship-related notes, I feel like there was way too much random wandering around, and too much time spent on Celery and how great she is. Her priorities continue to be way screwed up. One of her crowning moments in this book is that, while imprisoned, she once more agonizes over her figure and WHILE IMPRISONED, plays around with tying her sash so as to emphasize her assets and breastets. Also, ONCE AGAIN, people die to to Celery's incompetence (this time thousands instead of, you know, just the one) and she is like OMG it's all my fault! NAH, YOU THINK???I can tell that this is going the Girl of Fire route from THG, and Celery is going to be the figurehead for some grand revolution, but I don't like Celery nearly as much as I like Katniss. She feels way too manufactured and perfect, and apart from weeing in her trousers that one time from fear, we really don't get many human-like responses to things. She grandstands a lot and tosses off a lot of quotes that people seem to really enjoy quoting on Goodreads about how she's going to ""rattle the stars"", but she doesn't strike me personally as being particularly realistic or relatable. She's a Barbie in armor with magical powers, and that's hardly a 'strong female protagonist.' Particularly when stuck in an abusive relationship with some jerk who likes to tattoo all his mistakes in life on his arm. #lameAll that said, I do think this is an improvement over the two previous books, even if it gives off ""I desperately want to be the nextGame of Thronesvibes."" The writing is better, and the parts of the book that don't involve Celery were interesting. It's Celery herself who really poisons this series and makes me want to take my Snark to Warp 5. She's just such an idiot and everyone's thoughts revolve around her, and I can't help but think of that quote from 10 Things I Hate About You where she's concerned, where Patrick asks, ""What is it with this chick? She have beer-flavored nipples?""I'll read the next book because I'm invested now, and I hear book 5 is a raging fustercluck of wtf that dissolves into bodice-ripper territory (and you know HOW MUCH I LOVE THOSE). Who knows? Maybe I'll actually love it. I hear copious amounts of smut are involved, and I am the Mother of Smut (the Unrepentant, Breaker of Convention, etc. etc.). WE SHALL SEE~As always, you can credit this review to my friends who enjoy ""encouraging"" me to read books they think I'll hate, and also to the people who come onto my reviews thinking it's OK to tell me to STFU, because ha ha joke's on you, that only makes me want to post MOAR reviews. For the record, if you, or one of your friends, take issue with the way I review books, feel free to reach me at 1-800-GIRL-BYE.Peace out, friends.2 to 2.5 stars",2

1408,Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass #3),"“She was the heir of ash and fire, and she would bow to no one"".¡Por fin releí el libro para poder escribir la reseña! Y vaya que sí valió la pena la relectura porque no recordaba nada de nada.Después del desastroso final deCrown of Midnight, Chaol, Dorian y Celaena se separan y, así, la historia se divide en tres flancos. Chaol y Dorian, por una parte, se quedan en Rifthold, uno tratando de asimilar todo lo que comprendió sobre la identidad de Celaena y enredándose cada vez más en las garras de quienes quieren derrocar al rey y el otro lidiando con sus explosiones de magia y el peligro que corre si alguien equivocado las nota. Celaena, por su parte, llega al otro lado del continente a buscar respuestas sobre laswyrdkeysy, para ello, debe convencer a Maeve de que es digna y puede controlar sus poderesfae... y ahí es cuando entra Rowan. Finalmente, el tercer flanco de todoHeif of Firees Manon Blackbeak, que nos cuenta cómo las brujas se están reuniendo cerca delFerian Gappara entrenar conwyverns, una especie de dragones, y convertirse en uno de los ejércitos del Rey.Creo que enHeir of Firevemos uno de los cambios más grandes que Celaena ha tenido hasta el momento. Este es un libro un poco de transición, pues los rumbos de muchos personajes están cambiando y se están encaminando hacia el inevitable enfrentamiento que determinará si la magia realmente está muerta o si todo el legado ancestral logrará sobreponerse a un Rey peligroso que se está mezclando con poderes oscuros.Con este libro Sarah J. Maas hace que el universo crezca muchísimo y nos presenta nuevas tierras, nuevos reinos, nuevas costumbres y nuevos juegos de poder. Nos encontramos de frente con la magiafae, con nuevas criaturas y nuevas alianzas. Conocemos a los aquelarres de brujas Blackbeak, Yellowlegs y Blueblood y entendemos que son enemigos tremendamente formidables y que, encima, ahora están armadas conwyvernsy preparadas para la batalla.Y, más allá de todo lo demás, enHeir if Fireconocemos a Rowan, un personaje que no nos va a dejar pensar claramente, que es la personificación de lo que un guerrerofaedebería ser y que vamos a querer como amigo y no como enemigo. Rowan Whitethorn, ya cásate conmigo, por favor <3. Okay, pero dejando de lado las bromas, adoré que en este libro lo conociéramos a él y que, por fin, podamos llamar a Celaena como Aelin Ashryver Galathynius.AHORA... ¡LOS SPOILERS Y EL FANGIRLEO INTENSO!♣ ¿Qué tal lo vuelta mierda que estaba Celaena mientras está en Varese? Joder, es que lo de tener que dejar a Chaol, después de que él descubrió lo que había realmente dentro de ella fue tremendo. Entre eso y que no supera la muerte de Nehemia, que ni siquiera fue su culpa porque la princesa lo orquestó todo, pues fatal.♣ Cuando recién conocemos a Manon y asesina súper rápido a tres campesinos es como... O.O Esa mujer es súperbadass. Y la explicación de su capa es increíble: cuando Manon tenía 16 años mató a su primera bruja Crochan y se quedó con la capa que les dan cuando sangran por primera vez. Y no se la ha quitado desde entonces.♣ ¡¡¡Maldito sea el momento en el que Dorian se cae en un paseo con Aedion y se raspa la mano y termina en la enfermería con Sorscha!!! La odio mucho, me da igual, ni siquiera desde el primer momento me cayó bien. Que sí, que se ha quedado callada con todo lo que ha visto de Dorian, Chaol y Celaena, pero no me la soporto.♣ Debo admitir que al principio odié muchísimo a Rowan. Es un cabrón y le da un puño brutal a Celaena cuando ella se está quejando de que le toca entrenar con él antes de que Maeve le dé respuestas. Claro, primero lo odié y luego recapacité.♣ Me da PAVOR real lo que el rey puede llegar a hacer con 300 brujas sedientas de sangre y montadas enwyverns. Es que son demasiado brutales, peligrosas y violentas, de verdad. Van a ser un ejército de miedo.♣ Amo lo obsesionado que está Chaol en un principio con Aedion y con descubrir qué trama. ¡Pero luego resulta que Aedion nunca ha estado bajo el control del rey! Que todas las supuestas masacres del norte han sido falsas y que, cuando se dio cuenta de que el anillo negro era raro, hizo una réplica y se la cambió. ¡Y siempre ha estado trabajando en pro de la revolución y de derrocar al rey!♣ Los primeros entrenamientos de Celaena y Rowan son tremendos. Y ella sigue bloqueando su poder porque la asusta. ¡Y lo del campo dewightsme dejó fría. Incluso tuve pesadillas la noche en la que lo leí. Rowan deja a Celaena en ese campo, pero de repente todo se ve oscuro y llega una criatura a la que incluso loswightstemen y obliga a Celaena a recordar la noche en la que asesinaron a sus padres.Damn. Menos mal Rowan la saca a tiempo de allí.♣ O sea, de verdad, ODIO A LA PINCHE SORSCHA. Luego hay una escena en la que le tiene que curar el labio... ¡EL LABIO! A Dorian. Ugh. Y hay tensión. Pero no, Dorian no puede ser de ella. Me cae muy mal.♣ Un día Celaena baja a las cocinas por la noche y ve que Emrys está contando historias y que todo el mundo se reúne alrededor para escucharlas. Pero ve que también hay un halcón escuchando y, de repente, recuerda que vio ese halcón durante mucho tiempo siguiéndola en Varese. Y ESE HALCÓN ES ROWAN, O SEA QUE ÉL SIEMPRE LA ESTUVO CUIDANDO Y MISFEELS.♣ A ver, que yo sé que no hay tensión romántica, al menos hasta ahora, entre esos dos, pero no puedo evitarshippearlos.♣ ¿Qué tal cuando la magia de Dorian explota frente a Sorscha y ella lo cubre y miente por él? PUES MAL, ESA EXPLOSIÓN TENDRÍA QUE HABERLA MATADO. JUM.♣ Hay un momento muy épico en el que Chaol le revela a Aedion que Celaena, Aelin, está viva. ¡Y es precioso porque Aedion es su primo y siempre le ha sido muy leal! Entonces empieza a recordar cosas de su infancia y de verdad se nota el amor que le tiene a ella. Y que siempre va a estar a su lado sin importar lo que suceda.♣ A ver, yo sé que hay técnicas de entrenamientos y tal... y que lo que han hecho hasta ahora para que Celaena se transforme a su formafaey entrene no ha funcionado... PERO ES QUE ROWAN LA MUERDE. Y yo sé que tendría que ver eso como agresión y tal, pero es que en el contexto de losfaea mí me pareció súper sensual y casi me muero. Obvio después de eso Celaena se transforma de la ira que le da. ¡Y es que luego la conversación se va a que Celaena le pide que la muerda otra vez para ver si logra transformarse de nuevo Y ÉL LE DICE QUE NO PORQUE NO SE MUERDE A LASMATESDE OTROS MACHOS!♣ Joder, pero luego de eso Celaena y Rowan vuelven a pelear y él le dice que sería más útil para todos si realmente hubiera muerto hace diez años. QUÉ FUERTE. Celaena se cabrea y se va al bosque pretendiendo huir, pero luego la encuentran unosskinwalkersque quieren atacarla y de repente aparece Rowan para salvarla. Pero le dice que para lograr huir tiene que transformarse. Finalmente lo logra, pero los están alcanzando y Rowan está en peligro, así que Celaena deja salir su fuego azul, los carboniza y salva a Rowan. Al final queda helada y agotada, pero Rowan le da su capa y su abrigo Y YO ME MUERO DE AMOOOOOR.♣ Volviendo a las brujas, es el día en el que tienen que escogerwyverny todas las herederas de los clanes quieren a Titus, el más grande. Cuando sale Titus y está en el foso con la carnada, Iskra tira a Manon al foso para que muera. Pero ella pelea con Titus y elwyverncarnada la ayuda. Al final el pequeño logra matar a Titus y Manon lo elige como montura, a pesar de que no saben si va a volar, porque demostró valentía. Le pone Abraxos. Y la conexión que se ve que tienen es poderosísima.♣ ¡Momentazo en el que Dorian pilla a Aedion y Chaol escabulléndose a hacer planes! ¡Y luego le dicen que Celaena es Aelin! PERO LO MÁS FUERTE ES CUANDO DORIAN LE DICE QUE ÉL LA ACEPTA ASÍ, PERO QUE CHAOL NUNCA LO HIZO Y QUE NO PUEDE ELEGIR CUÁLES PARTES DE ELLA PUEDE AMAR. Inserte aquí unturn down for whatépico.♣ EWWWWWWWW al momento en el que Dorian besa a Sorscha por primera vez.♣ Hay unflashbackque tiene Celaena de cuando era pequeña y su poder era tan grande que una vez explotó en una biblioteca y quemó unos libros. Y todos le tenían miedo y se sentía muy sola. Pero la única persona que siempre estuvo allí para ella fue Aedion. Es todo muy triste.♣ Llega un punto en el que Chaol, Aedion, Ren y Murtaugh hablan de la teoría de las ondas y el triángulo y que quizá fue así como el rey hizo que la magia desapareciera de su reino. ¡POR FIN TODO VA TENIENDO SENTIDO!♣ Es muy angustiante ver por todo lo que tiene que pasar Manon con Abraxos, todos los entrenamientos especiales y los ultimátum de su abuela. ¡Pero es genial ver cómo cuando van a volar por primera vez Abraxos no elige el precipicio pequeño sino que se lanza al grande! ¡Y LO LOGRA!♣ ¿Podemos hablar del momento en el que Celaena fue a llevarle la cena a Rowan a su cuarto y se encuentra con Gavril semidesnudo sobre la mesa y ella piensa que acaba de interrumpir un momento íntimo cuando en realidad Rowan solo lo estaba tatuando? ME PARTÍ DE LA RISA, XD.♣¿Se acuerdan del momento en el que una de las pruebas de Rowan es salvar a Luca de la mitad de un lago congelado? Y es que si Celaena falla o calcina al muchacho o lo ahoga y se muere congelado. Al final lo salva e incluso vencen a un monstruo inesperado que estaba en el lago, pero luego explota contra Rowan y le dice que nunca más use a sus seres queridos para su entrenamiento. En medio de la discusión Celaena agarra a Rowan y le deja unas quemaduras en sus brazos y como se siente mal por ello va por la noche a dejarle una crema. Y AHÍ EL LE CUENTA LA HISTORIA DE SUS TATUAJES Y DE CÓMO PERDIÓ A SUMATEPOR EMBARCARSE CIEGAMENTE EN LAS MISIONES QUE MAEVE LE DABA. Ay, Rowan ☹.♣ Momentazo en el que Chaol le dice a Aedion que quemaron el trono que le correspondería a Celaena y Aedion le contesta QUE LE DA IGUAL PORQUE SI HACE FALTA ÉL LE CONTRUIRÁ UNO NUEVO CON LOS HUESOS DE SUS ENEMIGOS.HOLY SHIT!♣ A mí no me digan que no hay tensión sexual entre Celaena y Rowan porque después de que ella lo tatúa por encima de las quemaduras curadas todo es como askfhdsjklhfkdsfd. Y luego… LUEGO DICEN QUE NO SABEN QUÉ SON, PERO QUE LO RESOLVERÁN.Bye, morí.♣ ¿Qué tal cuando, supuestamente sin querer, Celaena le gruñe a las otras mujeres que se acercan a Rowan? LOL!!♣ Y, jodeeeeer, lo de Celaena estando al borde de la muerte por usar demasiado su poder y Rowan salvándola de nuevo y cargándola desde la fiesta hasta las piscinas heladas a riesgo de quemarse él también. LO AMO. ¡PERO LUEGO VE LA ESPALDA DE CELAENA Y LOS LATIGAZOS DE ENDOVIER Y SE SIENTE COMO UNA MIERDA PORQUE RECUERDA QUE EN SUS PRIMEROS ENTRENAMIENTOS LA AMENAZÓ CON AZOTARLA! Y luego duermen juntos y se quedan dormidos con las manos entrelazadas. A MÍ NO ME ENGAÑAN, AHÍ HAY ALGO.♣Sorry, pero morí de amor cuando acostados juntos dicen que da igual, que los dos se van a ir al infierno y se quedan ahí acariciándose el pelo y el pecho. Y LUEGO ÉL LE REGALA CHOCOLATES DE CUMPLEAÑOS. MI CORAZÓN NO PUEDE CON TANTO.♣ Pfff… cuando Celaena se entera de que el Rey asesinó a todas las personas de los campos de Calaculla y de Endovier. Maldito bastardo.♣ A ver, que hay un momento súper intenso en el que Celaena reclama a Rowan como su amigo. PERO ES QUE YO QUIERO QUE SE RECLAMEN COMOMATES, COMO AMANTES, NO COMO AMIGOS.♣ En medio de la batalla que están teniendo para proteger a la fortaleza aparecen los Valg, que son como príncipes del infierno súper poderosos y están obligando a Celaena a revivir sus peores recuerdos, pero después de un rato de sufrimiento DESPIERTA TODO SU PODER Y ACABA CON TODOS SIENDO UNABADASS. Y RESULTA QUE ROWAN Y ELLA SONCARRAMAN, ALGO ASÍ COMOPARABATAIY PUEDEN COMPARTIR SU PODER Y YA BÉSENSE, JODER.♣ Casi me vomito cuando Chaol le dice a Sorscha algo como que cree que le vendría bien al reino tener una reina que fuera curandera. GAS.♣ Celaena se da cuenta de que el Amuleto de Orynth que le dio su madre el día anterior a morir es una de laswyrdkeysy que no lo perdió en el río ese día como creyó sino que seguramente Arobynn se lo quitó cuando la encontró inconsciente en el río. BASTARDO ASQUEROSO.♣ ¿QUÉ TAL CUANDO LA MANDITA DE MAEVE ORDENA QUE AZOTEN A ROWAN PARA QUE CELAENA LE DIGA CUÁL ES LA TERCERAWYRDKEY? ZORRA DEL MAL.♣EPIC WIN!Cuando Celaena enciende todo Doranelle y amenaza a Maeve con quemar todo para que deje a Rowan en paz. Y AL FINAL LOGRA REVOCAR EL JURAMENTO DE SANGRE QUE TENÍA HACIA ELLA. Y ROWAN CASI LLORA Y LE DICE QUE LA RECLAMA COMO AMIGA Y ENTONCES SE UNE CON SU SANGRE A CELAENA. AYYYYY, CASI LLORO.♣ Casi me muero de tristeza y de todo cuando Rowan le tatúa a Celaena en la espalda la historia de la pérdida de sus padres, su tío, Lady Marion, su corte, su pueblo, Sam y Nehemia. ES QUE CADA QUE MENCIONAN A SAM RECUERDO LO QUE LE PASÓ Y NO ES JUSTO T_T.♣ Maldita sea, cuando el rey captura a Aedion por traicionarlo y le dice que no lo matará sino que esperará a que su prima, Aelin, vaya a rescatarlo para atraerla a una trampa. UDSFSDFD, ES QUE ODIO AL REY. Jo, y es que, claro, Aedion se entregó para proteger a Dorian y Chaol, pero no funciona mucho porque el rey revela que Sorscha era una espía y LA DECAPITAN ENFRENTE DE DORIAN. Que, vale, no me molesta mucho porque odiaba a la condenada. LO MALO ES QUE LA MAGIA DE DORIAN EXPLOTA FRENTE AL REY Y, JODER, JODER, JODER. Al final Dorian retiene al rey mientras Chaol escapa.♣ Celaena y Rowan se separan. Él estará en Mistward mientras ella va a Rifthold a recuperar la tercerawyrdkeyde las manos de Arobynn. Y EL LIBRO TERMINA CON ELLA DICIENDO QUE ES AELIN ASHRYVER GALATHYNIUS Y QUE NO ESTARÁ ASUSTADA. AHHHHHHH!!!",5

It's is awesome, they are awesome and I'm hoping they are going to be mates!!Rowan trains Celaena in her magic, she has fun magic, she's not called fireheart for nothing. She can burn everything!I have to be truthful and say I didn't care anything about what was going on with Chaol or Dorian. And I definitely didn't care about Manon. Their stories were nothing compared to Rowan and Celaena. I just wanted to read about them. I loved learning all about Celaena's back story. I mean she has a lot going on now. She so much more than what people think. She's still bad to the bone, just even more so.The full five stars I'm giving this book is for Rowan and Celaena, nothing else. They just rocked my world and that's all their is too it. I have no idea what everyone else was doing, to a certain extent anyway.There are some evil things going on in the world of the Fae and other places and it's up to Rowan and Celaena to put a stop to it.

Part of me wants to go back in time and protect that little boy who wanted nothing more than to dream and draw and be who he was without being attacked for it.”why when someone explains their trauma and shit someone always gets horny? i don't get it???? and this sentence just makes me icky. he's saying stuff that happened to him as a kid and you want to make him horny????

Rowan and Zahra start off as hating each other, but quickly become friends and eventually they're in love 🥰Now, back to what I was saying before.

When Zahra needs to find someone to illustrate her ideas, Rowan gave Zahra the number of a guy he made up, Scott, and pretended to be him for a while, like at least a month.It was predictable that Zahra was going to be pissed when she found out about Scott actually being Rowan, but it's always fun to watch heroes chase after heroines like puppy dogs so it's both good and bad.

1421,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)","the potential this book has is staggering but the lack of refinement makes this subpar at best. you could cut this book in half and it would still be the exact same story just waaaay less exhausting.bcos the parts that weren’t a snoozefest? they hit hard for me, ngl. there were some seriously cute moments between Rowan and Zahra— especially some of the special things Rowan did for her. with the book signing, the dinners, the drawings, etc.and hands down, Rowan and Ani���s interactions were the superior parts of this book. i will die on this hill!!but the parts of this that were insufferably boring??i wanted to give this three stars. but the way i skimmed the fuck out of the last quarter of this book. like you best believe i wasi will tell you why this book exhausted me so much—the contradictions.the first one being, this is supposed to be a slowburn. and it is... in a way. but the insta-lust definitely undermines the slowburn aspect – like they kiss for the first time around the 20% mark?then they spend the rest of the first half of the book afterwards wondering in their internal dialogues if the other likes them/if there’s anything going on between them... girl you felt his dick in the boardroom two days ago, im taking a wild stab in the dark and saying yes.it was just so strange. idk how to articulate how i felt reading them go back and forth after their kiss. it felt as though the author added the kiss to placate the readers who don’t like slowburn. then for the readers whodolike slowburn, get to see Zahra and Rowan go painfully back and forth for the rest of the book... best of both worlds?! but it failed miserably imo.the other example that stood out to me was when Rowan admits to Zahra he’s Scott... that is a whole other can of worms i ain’t even touching bcos wtf.but when he apologises, Rowan basically declares how obsessed and infatuated he is with Zahra, how he can’t think of anyone else but her. how she’s makes him a better person. blah blah blahhhh... then when they have sex right after, Rowan tells her this can’t be anything more than causual between them?my guy, you basically just declared you’re in love with her without using the word love. and you’re both agreeing to this relationship being causal? followed by a date in the city at the most expensive restaurant where a single glass of wine is £200 and you’re legit dressed up like you’re going to a ball? hmmm, yeah casual as fuck that.then he whisks her away to New York and plans a whole book event and meet and greet with her favourite author... then immediately rebukes that she’s his gf. it made zero sense and was so annoying to read. like if he was doing the bare minimum while insisting they were causal, fine. but when they talk like a couple. act like a couple. think like a couple. then they’re a couple.so it felt like a weak way to just prolong the already exhaustingly long plot that should have ended when Rowan admitted he was Scott. Lauren Asher needed to pick a conflict and stick with it. there were too many overlapping ones that i struggled to identify what was *bad* and what was just a regular piece of the plot.so the contradictions just kept undermining the romance and it was so damn annoying. idk if it was the author’s way to cause conflict? to drag shit out waaay longer than it had to. bcos i am telling you right now. this book could have been 200 pages shorter and nothing would have been different.it’s just filled with a lot of base, repetitive filler in these small pockets of boring interactions. any time i had something to finally sink my teeth into, it was yanked away for the repetitive formula to start up again: of Rowan and Zahra bickering at work, saying the same things over and over and over again. to Rowan and Zahra having the same thoughts and dilemmas about each other, over and over and over again. to them talking online about the same things... you get the picture right?i will give another example bcos i am putting my English degree to good use😌Zahra says this to Rowan at 67%:“I think you hate how much you want me. Because to care about me means you have to admit to having a heart.” I place a soft kiss against his lips. “So keep telling yourself those pretty little lies. Your secret is safe with me.”she gives a bit of a monologue, this is just a snippet of it. now this is cute or whatever... but this has been established already. like approximately three or four times?? during Rowan’s huge declaration i mentioned earlier, all of this is established – that he low-key hates how much he wants her. so why tf do you have to keep telling me every few pages, maam? i get it. you don’t have to bat me over the head with the same poetical, flowery nonsense. any chance they got, it was reiterated that Rowan made Zahra ✨feel✨and they would admit to one another how much they meant to each other... while keeping things casual.y’all need to look up the definition of casual in the dictionary bcos i think you’ve got the wrong idea.this particular repeated sentiment just heightened my awareness of just how much of this book was filler content. it got to the point where id read an interaction or a conversation or an inner monologue and think “swear to god i have already read this??” probably why it took me so long to read and why i then ended up skimming the ending.i just loathe in books when there’s truly nothing keeping the MCs apart anymore and they both know they have feelings for each other. yet do precisely nothing about it and aren’t together... for what? angst? drama? conflicts? bcos to me, y’all just look fucking dumb as shit.and it annoys me so much bcos this had potential for me to be really good! you best believe i am reading Declan and Cal’s books... Cal, sir👀 if you’re looking for a heroine for your book look no further baby😘i fluctuated so much with the characters. one minute i loved Zahra and was riding the Rowan-hate train... then after one small conversation or interaction my feelings would do a reverse uno and it was Rowan i was rooting for while Zahra was the one grating on my last nerve.it was draining to keep up with them. slowburn gotta deliver the delicious burn to compensate from being so slow. but their back and forth just burnt my brain cells to a crisp.i hope i make sense bcos at this point, i feel like im rambling since trying to articulate my thoughts is a struggle😭that being said. i liked the moments i liked... if that makes sense. if i could cut all the useless shit out of this book, the way this would be soooo good. it had the bones of a good book, just Lauren Asher needed to decide what she wanted this book to be. slowburn or insta-lust? then the grumpy-sunshine, the workplace aspect with forced proximity and the boss and employee dynamic, the talking online but not knowing you know each other in real life...it just needed so much refinement. for real, someone needs to get Lauren Asher and editor. and if she already has one they need to be fired.random side note:whenever characters have sex in cars, i really want their chauffeurs to slam the breaks on while they’re fucking and send the bitches flying. y’all need to pull your trousers up and put yourself seatbelts on for fuck sake. can’t you wait??!",2

1427,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)","Full of cliches, trashy yet something that keeps you mildly entertained.Plot- 2/5 stars🌟Spice- 2.5/5🌶️I honestly don't even know where to start with the review. I apologise in advance cause this borderlines a rant review, tho in my defence it's not my fault.Starting with the central plot- the romance.It's insta love, without the love and without the lust. Weird huh? It's because there is NO CHEMISTRY. None whatsoever, and that stays consistent for about 75% of the book. The little crumbs of chemistry we got is when the two main characters decide to fight for over- you guessed it- nothing! It was forced in their cause of the third act. What's a romance book without any fights? Like please, KMN. Can authors stop doing that? Thank you. They kissed in the first 45 pages so.. Also the sex is so vanilla you would want to skim through it.The side plot- Dreamland park.Now this is where the author gained some points from me. The romance was so bad, that the development of the park seemed much more entertaining to me.The cliches. (Let's count how many there were)1. The MMC is a billionaire grump that doesn't trust anyone but him. The FMC is an employee with a sunshine personality, who gets along with everyone.2. FMC is into charity, the billionaire's heart immediately melts.3. The dialogues are so typical. Expect to see sentences like-I let go of the breath I didn't realise I was holding in.OrHow do I do that? You're a smart guy, figure it out.Like dude for once, give the man an idea on what to do. But yeah you get the gist.4. The billionaire just had to take her on a private jet to NYC, otherwise it won't be a rich guy romance. (That one I'm willing to let go of).5. The girl falls sick and is rushed to the hospital. Then they go Twilight on it, but MMC actually leaves and causes unnecessary drama.6. Did I mention the unnecessary drama that HAD to happen, otherwise no one would like it?! 🤦‍♀️Guys, I didn't even start with the characters yet.FMC- Zahrais presented as the sunshine girl. Everything she does is amazing, people don't see her beyond her smile. Cut it out. Zahra had the personality of a six year old on sugar high, which was highly annoying to read. The author had to write in that the character does charity work in order to get readers to like her. Didn't work with me but okay cool. She didn't contribute much to him, didn't give anything back.MMC- Rowanequally as vanilla as Zahra, but slightly better. He's the typical billionaire grump, won't elaborate on it further. He is however, easier to like. His character arc was handled much better cause of the Dreamland initiative but then the girl got sick and he acted like a douche, so minus points for that. He did try to learn more about Zahra and enjoy the things she does.I did however liked Ani, Zahra's sister. She was full of life and so so easy to like and read about. Claire and Rowan's brothers were there too and that's pretty much about them.One of the things that I liked, except Ani, was the texting interactions between the two main characters. That shined on Rowan's character more. It did bring more colors to the mundane romance.The writingis average, bordering Wattpad style. But there's a lot of potential and room for improvement.I will still read Terms and Conditions, cause I already bought it and I kinda have to. I'm petty and don't want to waste my money, excuse the fact that I already did but yeah...I'm still curious about the author's Dirty Air series- hope that's much better.",2

1433,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)","OK FIRST OF ALL:y'all do such a shitty job at advertising books, this should be illegal.What's the point of saying: I am a bookstagrammer when you DON'T DISCLOSE important information?This book is a Walt Disney's grandson fanfic.The most important disclaimer of all:If you are NOT A DISNEY ADULT, this book is NOT FOR YOU.You just gotVERYlucky that I happen to be A DISNEY adult otherwise this book would have been ripped to shreds. I just came into this with the right set of expectations. Even thoughNO ONE SAID THIS WAS A DISNEYfanfic basically.I feel like most of the mixed reviews can be avoided if you know how to recommend a book, so here I am doing everyone's jobs.Anyways, lazy recommendation aside...I came into this with the right set of expectations because I knew this was a romcom.Basically, the main character Rowan is Walt Disney's grandson. He has 2 other brothers, Walt Disney dies but he leaves behind a letter, he won't let the boys take over the company and the park together it if they don't meet certain requirements he made on that letter.The boys lost their mom and hate their dad, if they don't meet those requirements, their dad will get the majority of the shares and they don't want that.Rowan used to be very creative, so grandpa wants him to find that side of himself again, one of the brothers is a womanizer so he has to get married and have kids, and the other is an ADHD kid, who fucks shit up all the time and I can't really remember exactly what was his thing.This is also a GRUMPY-SUNSHINE book.They are my least favorite, but I actually enjoyed how this was written. The sunshine main character was way less annoying than I thought she would be. We also get some amazing down syndrome representation in this book, since the FMC's sister has down syndrome.You also get to see a soulless capitalist man turn into a socialist, a guy who cares about his employees, because of pussy but still... it's a pretty big step.This is VERY similar to the hating game and the love hypothesis, if you loved those, you are going to enjoy this.The sunshine character works under Rowan, so you also get somewhat of an office/authority relationship scenario.Honestly, this was spicier than the love hypothesis and the hating game combined, we get 3-4 amazing sex scenes, they are pretty explicit as well. The dirty talk was awesome and not cringy at all. Rowan exudes BDE and I liked the way he talked to her.This was a cookie cutter romcom that fit every box, it was emotional, romantic, there's some miscommunication trope (twice to 3 times), sex after 60%, a little bit of a slow-burn and a happy ending.The writing was great and I had a great time. 4/5Now that I read back on my review I feel like I need to make something clear: when I say Disney adult, I mean DISNEY PARK adult. The entire book happens inside of Walt Disney World, I was there two months ago and had such a fucking magical time, so it got me.",4

1436,"The Fine Print (Dreamland Billionaires, #1)","Can Rowan G. Kane draw me like on of his French girls??? Please??? 😳OVERALL THOUGHTS The idea for this book was beautiful and fresh. The Kane family through generations owns the multi-billion Dreamland theme park. When the grandfather passes away, he leaves letters for his grandchildren. Each letter contains a task that the brothers have to complete in order to receive their inheritance. This book follows Rowan Kane, our youngest brother.However, the execution was severely lacking. I've read only one book by Lauren Asher before. It was Throttled from her Dirty Air series and in my opinion, that one was much better. I can't speak for other books in that series since I've yet to read them. This is a dual POV adult romance with a 7 year age gap (Rowan is 7 years older than Zahra)... but our male love interest is a manchild. I wasn't really invested in the romance, I still can't define their relationship as the infamous L word. I could see the lust, their mutual dedication to the company and its cause, their love for grandpa Kane. They did share cute moments, Rowan really did some good things for Zahra, but there wasn't a single page where I thought to myself ""Wow these two should end up together, they're made for each other"". The THING between them progressed pretty quickly, but then it dragged for no reason. This book is pretty long, but the necessary character development wasn't there. We just got to a certain point in the book where the author needed to present Rowan as a man of our (and Zahra's ofc) dreams, so she had him behave completely out of character!I must admit, some parts were SO FUNNY (especially their chats), I underlined all of those.CHARACTERSZAHRA A GIRLBOSS, I loved her so much. We don't get women as strong and as independent as her in fiction very often. AND I NEVER GET TIRED OF THESE CHARACTERS. She's this bright and intelligent person who took hardships in life and used them as a weapon to make herself a better person. THE FAVORITE PART OF THIS BOOK for me was Zahra's relationship with her sister Ani. And Ani was my favorite character. I have a soft spot for disability rep in fiction and THIS ONE was executed so well! I wouldn't say that any of the dialogue she was involved in was very realistic, but I can forgive that one.ROWAN This man had one genuine personality trait and that was his passion for drawing. It was so cool to see someone who acts all tough have a creative side (i know the bar is in hell). However, he was straight up rude on so many occasions... IMMA PASS.TERMS AND CONDITIONS NEXT, hopefully it's better!!!💕💕",3
